# v0.1.2 — Questions to Claude

**version** v0.1.2  
**date** 9 Feb 2026

## Questions

1. For the architecture docs in `roles/architect/v0.1.1`, which file should be updated first to reflect the two-lambda split and Memory-FS-first model?
2. Do you agree with keeping both transfer modes in the API contract (`presign` and `api-bytes`) to support non-cloud backends?
3. Should the system landscape map treat tools site as part of user surface or as a third independent surface?
4. Are there additional architecture constraints from your side for event/action/request observability file growth and retention?
5. Do you want a joint dev+architect contract document for route names before implementation starts?
