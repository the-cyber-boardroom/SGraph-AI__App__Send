# v0.1.2 — Questions to Librarian

**version** v0.1.2  
**date** 9 Feb 2026

## Questions

1. Do you want a dedicated docs index file under `library/` for SGraph Send role docs, or should role docs stay discoverable only by folder structure?
2. Should page-design artifacts for IFD live inside source folders (`frontend/page-designs`) or inside a docs folder with mirrored structure?
3. Do you want versioned doc aliases (latest pointers) for role files, or strict version-only references?
4. Is there a preferred template for per-role question docs so all roles use consistent structure?
5. For dependency guidance docs, do you want a curated "required reading by role" file in this repo?
