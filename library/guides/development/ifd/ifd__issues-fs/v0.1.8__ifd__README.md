# Issues-FS UI — Architecture Documentation (v0.1.8)

**Read this first.** This folder contains the complete architecture documentation for the Issues-FS UI — an event-driven, Web Components-based frontend built with the IFD (Iterative Flow Development) methodology.

These docs are designed to be **self-contained and portable** — you can give this entire folder to an LLM working on a different project to implement the same architecture.

## Reading Order

### 1. Start Here — Overview & Quick-Start
**File**: [`v0.1.8__ifd__implementation-reference.md`](v0.1.8__ifd__implementation-reference.md)

Full architecture diagram, the five pillars, step-by-step quick-start for new projects, and file-size reference. This is the map — read it first to understand how everything fits together.

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
**File**: [`v0.1.8__ifd__event-driven-architecture.md`](v0.1.8__ifd__event-driven-architecture.md)

The foundation. How the centralized EventBus works, event naming conventions, how components emit/subscribe, event flow examples, and anti-patterns. Every other document builds on this.

### 3. Web Components, Shell & Router
**File**: [`v0.1.8__ifd__web-components-and-shell.md`](v0.1.8__ifd__web-components-and-shell.md)

How the application shell (`<issues-shell>`) manages layout, navigation, and app lifecycle. The component contract (what every mini-app must implement), the router API, main apps vs sidebar apps, hash routing, CSS conventions, and loading order.

### 4. Debug Panel & Observability (RHS Panel)
**File**: [`v0.1.8__ifd__debug-panel-and-observability.md`](v0.1.8__ifd__debug-panel-and-observability.md)

The right-hand side panel with four tabs: **Messages** (user-facing notifications with auto-open on errors), **Events Viewer** (live stream of all EventBus events), **API Logger** (every fetch() call with request/response bodies), and **Automation Runner** (predefined test scenarios). Includes the interceptor pattern used by Events Viewer and API Logger.

### 5. Services & API Integration
**File**: [`v0.1.8__ifd__services-and-api-integration.md`](v0.1.8__ifd__services-and-api-integration.md)

How to build services that wrap API calls, manage client-side cache, and emit events. The service template, GraphService example, ConfigManager, surgical service overrides, and the auto-wiring pattern (api-error → messages → auto-open panel).

## Parent Document

These docs are an implementation of the IFD methodology. For the methodology itself (versioning, surgical overrides, testing strategy), see the parent guide:

**File**: [`../v1.2.1__ifd__intro-and-how-to-use.md`](../v1.2.1__ifd__intro-and-how-to-use.md)

## Source Code

The UI code documented here lives at:

```
modules/Issues-FS__Service__UI/issues_fs_service_ui__console/v0/v0.1/
├── v0.1.0/    ← base: event-bus, config, graph-service, shell, core components
├── v0.1.1/    ← surgical: api-logger
├── v0.1.2/    ← surgical: automation-runner, kanban DnD, node-list scroll fix
├── v0.1.3/    ← surgical: node-detail markdown toggle + comments, kanban create
├── v0.1.4/    ← surgical: messages-service, messages-panel, graph-viewer, hash routing
├── v0.1.5/    ← surgical: graph viz modes, confirm dialogs, back navigation
└── v0.1.6/    ← surgical: root selector, child issues, tree view, link type filtering
```

Each version folder contains **only the surgical overrides** for that version — not full file copies. The `index.html` in each version loads the full chain from v0.1.0 through to itself.

## Key Concepts (TL;DR)

| Concept | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Zero dependencies** | Pure ES6 + Web Components + browser APIs. No React, no build step. |
| **Event-driven** | All component communication via `window.issuesApp.events` (EventBus) |
| **Self-contained components** | Each component = one `.js` file with HTML + CSS + logic |
| **Shell + Router** | `<issues-shell>` manages layout, nav, app lifecycle |
| **Debug panel** | Right sidebar with Messages, Events, API Log, Automation tabs |
| **Interceptor pattern** | Events Viewer wraps `emit()`, API Logger wraps `fetch()` |
| **Surgical overrides** | Later versions override individual methods via `Class.prototype.method = ...` |
| **Services as singletons** | `window.issuesApp.graph`, `.config`, `.messages` — all emit events |
| **Auto-wiring** | `api-error` → MessagesService → `message-added` → Panel auto-opens |
