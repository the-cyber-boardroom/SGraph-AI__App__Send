# SGraph Send v0.3.5 — Conductor

**Role:** Sprint planning, task prioritisation, role activation, success criteria.

> For architecture decisions see [Architect](v0.3.5__architect.md). For test strategy see [QA](v0.3.5__qa.md). For milestone history see [Historian](v0.3.5__historian.md).

## Current Sprint Context

### Two-Team Operating Model

As of v0.3.0, the Conductor orchestrates two independent tracks:

| Team | Focus | Cadence |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Explorer** | New features, experiments, discovery | Minor versions (IFD) |
| **Villager** | Stability, hardening, production release | Major versions |

The Conductor sets priorities within each track and manages handover between them.

## Risk Register (Sprint-Level)

| ID | Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|----|------|-------------|--------|------------|--------|
| RF-23 | Sprint scope creep | Medium | Medium | Standing directive: "no new features in Villager" | Active |
| RF-24 | Role fatigue (14 active roles) | Medium | Medium | Batch activations, async reviews | Active |
| RF-25 | Cache service bucket config | Low | High | Verified: env var in CI pipeline | Mitigated |
| RF-29 | Admin API key in browser | Medium | High | Use httpOnly cookie for admin auth | Open |
| RF-30 | No QUnit in CI | High | Medium | Add Karma runner when tests exist | Open |
| RF-31 | IFD version sprawl | Medium | Medium | Major version consolidation gate | Active |
| RF-32 | Explorer/Villager boundary | Low | High | Clear separation rules in CLAUDE.md | Active |

## Success Criteria

### Explorer v0.3.5 Criteria

| # | Criterion | Metric |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Design agency brief ready for handoff | Deliverable exists |
| 2 | Large file transfer architecture documented | Architect review filed |
| 3 | At least one bot integration prototyped | Working demo |
| 4 | Handover brief for 5 Custom-Built components | Documents exist |
| 5 | All Explorer action plans filed by roles | 14 action plans |

### Villager v0.3.5 Criteria

| # | Criterion | Metric |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | CloudWatch alarms active | Zero silent failures |
| 2 | Rate limiting deployed | Abuse protection live |
| 3 | Post-deploy smoke tests in CI | Every deploy verified |
| 4 | Auth edge cases tested | 5+ new tests |
| 5 | Production CI trigger exists | One-click prod deploy |

---

## Standing Directives

1. **Villagers do NOT add features.** Functionality is frozen at Explorer's final version.
2. **Villagers do NOT fix bugs that change behaviour.** Bugs go back to Explorer.
3. **Explorers do NOT deploy to production.** Production is Villager territory.
4. **Explorers do NOT optimise for performance.** That's Villager's job.
5. **No role works without a brief.** All work triggered by briefs or sprint tasks.

## Sprint Velocity

From [Historian](v0.3.5__historian.md):

| Period | Versions Shipped | Decisions | Tests Added |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Days 1-3 (MVP) | v0.1.0 → v0.2.15 | D001–D013 | 0 → 56 |
| Days 4-5 (Features) | v0.2.16 → v0.2.45 | D014–D033 | 56 → 111 |
| Day 6 (Admin UI + Teams) | v0.2.46 → v0.3.5 | D034–D047 | 111+ |

Effective velocity: **12x** (5 days of AI-assisted work = equivalent of ~60 days traditional development). Pattern documented as P08 in Historian records.
