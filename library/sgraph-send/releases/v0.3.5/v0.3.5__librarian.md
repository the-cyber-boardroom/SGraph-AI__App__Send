### File Naming Convention

- Version from `sgraph_ai_app_send/version`
- Description uses double-underscore separators
- Date from folder path: `reviews/YY-MM-DD/`

## Debrief Chain

Debriefs are human-facing summaries created after each batch of work:

| Date | Version | Debrief | Content |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| 13 Feb | v0.2.24 | `v0.2.24__debrief__daily-brief-responses.md` | Brief #1 responses across 7 roles |
| 14 Feb | v0.3.0 | `v0.3.0__debrief__daily-brief-responses-and-admin-ui.md` | Brief #2 + admin UI + team split |

All debriefs live in `team/humans/dinis_cruz/debriefs/`.

## Issues FS

File-based issue tracking at `.issues/`:

- Used for tracking work items, bugs, and feature requests
- Format documented in `library/dependencies/issues-fs/`
- Issues linked to phases, roles, and specs
- Status: adopted as primary tracking mechanism (replaces ad-hoc lists)
