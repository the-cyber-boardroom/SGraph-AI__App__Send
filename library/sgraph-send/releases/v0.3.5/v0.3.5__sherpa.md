## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Send a File (Sender)

```
1. Land on /send                    ← Needs: understand what this is
2. Enter access token               ← Friction: where do I get a token?
3. Select file                      ← Clear
4. Wait for encryption + upload     ← Needs: progress indicator, reassurance
5. Receive share URL                ← Needs: copy button, explanation of URL
6. Share URL with recipient         ← Needs: guidance on secure sharing
```

### Journey 2: Receive a File (Receiver)

```
1. Click shared URL                 ← Clear (one-click)
2. See file info + transparency     ← Needs: understand what's happening
3. Click download                   ← Clear
4. Wait for download + decryption   ← Needs: progress indicator
5. Save decrypted file              ← Clear (browser save dialog)
```

### Journey 3: Manage Tokens (Admin)

```
1. Navigate to /admin               ← Needs: know the URL exists
2. Authenticate                     ← Needs: have API key
3. View token list                  ← Clear
4. Create/revoke tokens             ← Clear
5. View analytics pulse             ← Needs: understand metrics

## Friction Log

Known friction points observed or anticipated:

| ID | Journey | Friction | Severity | Resolution |
|----|---------|---------|----------|------------|
| F001 | Sender | "What is an access token?" — no explanation | High | Add tooltip/help text |
| F002 | Sender | "How do I get a token?" — no self-service | High | Link to admin or explain |
| F003 | Sender | No progress indicator during encryption | Medium | Add progress bar |
| F004 | Sender | Share URL is long and complex | Low | Add copy button, shorten display |
| F005 | Sender | "Is my file really encrypted?" — no confirmation | Medium | Show encryption confirmation |
| F006 | Receiver | "What is zero-knowledge?" — no explanation | Medium | Add brief explainer |
| F007 | Receiver | "Is this safe to download?" — no trust signals | Medium | Show transparency panel |
| F008 | Admin | Admin URL not discoverable | Low | Only admin knows it (by design) |
| F009 | Sender | No file type guidance | Low | Add supported types info |
| F010 | Sender | No file size limits shown | Medium | Display max size before upload |
| F011 | Receiver | Decryption failure has poor error message | Medium | Add clear error + retry guidance |

## Guidance Strategy

### In-App Guidance (Planned)

| Type | Where | Content |
|------|-------|---------|
| **First-time tooltip** | Upload page | "Files are encrypted in your browser before upload" |
| **Token help** | Access gate | "Enter the access token provided by your administrator" |
| **Progress messages** | Upload/download | "Encrypting...", "Uploading encrypted file...", "Decrypting..." |
| **Share guidance** | After upload | "Share this URL securely. The decryption key is in the link." |
| **Transparency panel** | Download page | "Here's what the server stored (and what it didn't)" |
| **Error guidance** | On failure | Clear message + suggested action |

### External Guidance (Planned)

| Content | Priority | Format |
|---------|----------|--------|
| "How It Works" page | P1 | Visual 3-step guide |
| FAQ section | P2 | Q&A format |
| Security overview | P2 | Non-technical explainer |
| API documentation | P3 | Developer reference |

## Trail Observation

### What's Working Well

| Observation | Evidence |
|-------------|---------|
| One-click download (hash-fragment URL) | No extra steps for receiver |
| Transparency panel | Users can verify server-side data |
| i18n auto-detect | Language switches without user action |
| Zero cookies | No consent banner needed |

### What Needs Improvement

| Observation | Impact | Owner |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| No onboarding for first-time senders | Users confused about tokens | Sherpa + Designer |
| No visual feedback during encryption | Users think page is frozen | Dev |
| No landing page context | Users arrive at upload form cold | Designer + Journalist |
| Error messages are technical | Non-technical users can't recover | Dev + Sherpa |

## Friendlies Programme

The Sherpa identifies and nurtures early adopters who can provide feedback:

| Stage | Activity | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 1. Identify | Find early adopters from LinkedIn engagement | In progress |
| 2. Onboard | Provide tokens, walk through first transfer | Planned |
| 3. Observe | Collect friction points, confusion, delight | Planned |
| 4. Feedback | Structured interview (5 questions) | Planned |
| 5. Iterate | Feed findings to Designer and Dev | Planned |
