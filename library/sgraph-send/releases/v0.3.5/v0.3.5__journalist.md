### Transparency Explainer

Core messaging for "what our server sees":

```
What we store:           What we NEVER see:
─────────────           ──────────────────
✓ Encrypted bytes       ✗ Your file contents
✓ File size             ✗ Your file name
✓ Timestamp             ✗ Your decryption key
✓ Download count        ✗ Your identity
✓ IP hash (SHA-256)     ✗ Your raw IP address
```

This messaging is embedded in the transparency panel component and used across all marketing/communication.

**Validation gate:** All security claims verified by [AppSec](v0.3.5__appsec.md) before publication. No security claim is published without AppSec sign-off.

## Messaging Strategy

### Core Message

**"Your files, your keys, your privacy."**

Zero-knowledge encryption means the server cannot read your files — even if compromised. The decryption key never leaves your browser.

### Target Audiences

| Audience | Message Emphasis |
|----------|-----------------|
| Privacy-conscious users | "We can't read your files, by design" |
| Security professionals | "AES-256-GCM, Web Crypto API, hash-fragment key distribution" |
| Enterprise / compliance | "Zero-knowledge architecture, no PII stored" |
| Developers | "Open source, self-hostable, 7 deployment targets" |
| General public | "Like WeTransfer, but private" |

### Competitive Positioning

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|---------|
| "Zero-knowledge" | No decrypt operations in server code (verified by AppSec) |
| "Zero cookies" | GA removed (D019), no tracking |
| "Open source" | GitHub repo (planned public release) |
| "Self-hostable" | 7 deployment targets (Lambda, Docker, EC2, etc.) |
| "Industry-standard encryption" | AES-256-GCM via Web Crypto API |

## Content Pipeline

### Production Workflow

1. **Identify topic** — from briefs, milestones, or decisions
2. **Draft content** — following messaging guidelines
3. **Security review** — AppSec verifies all security claims
4. **Publish** — to appropriate channel (site, LinkedIn, documentation)

### Planned Content (Explorer Track)

| Content | Priority | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Landing page copy ("Why not WeTransfer?") | P1 | Planning |
| Design agency brief — content sections | P1 | Planning |
| Developer documentation (API reference) | P2 | Not started |
| Security whitepaper | P2 | Not started |
| Blog: "Building Zero-Knowledge in 6 Days" | P3 | Not started |

## LinkedIn Strategy

Content for Dinis's LinkedIn presence:

- **Milestone posts** — announce key achievements (MVP, admin UI, team split)
- **Technical deep-dives** — explain architectural decisions (zero-knowledge, IFD)
- **Community engagement** — respond to early adopter interest
- **Frequency** — 1-2 posts per week during active development
