## Current UX State

### User Workflow (v0.1.4)

The upload/download flow is functional but uses developer-grade UI:

| Page | Status | UX Quality |
|------|--------|------------|
| Upload (index.html) | Working | Functional, minimal styling |
| Download (download.html) | Working | Functional, minimal styling |
| Access gate (token entry) | Working | Basic form |
| Transparency panel | Working | Shows what server stores |
| i18n | Working | 8 languages, auto-detect |

### Admin Console (v0.1.0)

| Component | Status | UX Quality |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Token Manager | Working | Basic CRUD interface |
| Analytics Dashboard | Working | Pulse display |
| System Info | Working | Health check, version |
| Shell/Navigation | Working | Sidebar with sections |

### Design Debt

- No professional logo or brand identity
- No landing page ("why should I use this?")
- No visual hierarchy or typography system
- No consistent colour palette beyond dark theme
- No onboarding flow
- No empty states or loading patterns

## Design Agency Brief (Cruz & Cruz)

### Brief Structure (9 sections planned)

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| 1. Company overview | SGraph AI, parent brand, mission |
| 2. Project overview | SGraph Send — zero-knowledge file sharing |
| 3. Technical context | Encryption model, zero-knowledge, hash-fragments |
| 4. Target audience | Privacy-conscious professionals, security teams, journalists |
| 5. Brand requirements | Logo, colour palette, typography, tone of voice |
| 6. Website requirements | Landing page, upload/download flow, admin console |
| 7. Deliverables | Logo variants, style guide, page mockups, icon set |
| 8. Constraints | IFD methodology, Web Components, no frameworks |
| 9. Timeline | To be determined with agency |

### Kickoff Presentation Plan

A companion presentation for the agency meeting covering:
- Live demo of current upload/download flow
- Security model explained visually
- Competitive positioning (WeTransfer, Firefox Send, Tresorit)
- IFD methodology constraints (what the agency can/cannot change)

## Landing Page Strategy

### "Why not WeTransfer?" Positioning

| Feature | WeTransfer | SGraph Send |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Encryption | Server-side (they can read your files) | Client-side (zero-knowledge) |
| Privacy | Tracks users, cookies, analytics | Zero cookies, no tracking |
| File names | Visible to server | Never sent to server |
| Key management | Server holds keys | Key stays in your browser |
| Open source | No | Yes (planned) |
| Self-hostable | No | Yes (7 deployment targets) |

### Landing Page Sections (Planned)

1. Hero — "Your files, your keys, your privacy"
2. How it works — 3-step visual (encrypt → share → decrypt)
3. Transparency — "Here's what our server sees" (and doesn't see)
4. Comparison — Feature matrix vs competitors
5. Technical details — For the security-minded audience
6. CTA — Try it now (link to /send)

## Theme System

### Current Implementation

CSS variables support theme switching:

```css
:root {
    --bg-primary: #1a1a2e;        /* Dark theme default */
    --bg-secondary: #16213e;
    --text-primary: #e0e0e0;
    --accent: #0f3460;
    --accent-highlight: #e94560;
}
```

### Planned Themes

| Theme | Target Audience |
|-------|-----------------|
| Aurora (dark) | Default — developer/security audience |
| Glacier (light) | Business/enterprise |
| Ember (warm dark) | Design-conscious users |
| Minimal (high contrast) | Accessibility focus |
| Custom (brand) | White-label deployments |

Theme selection persisted via localStorage preference.

## IFD Constraints for Design

The Designer must work within IFD (Incremental Feature Delivery) methodology:

1. **Versioned paths** — each design iteration is a new version folder
2. **Web Components** — all UI elements are custom elements
3. **No Shadow DOM** — CSS cascade applies globally
4. **No frameworks** — vanilla JS/HTML/CSS only
5. **Surgical updates** — only changed files in new version folder
6. **Zero external dependencies** — no CDN, no npm packages in frontend

This means the design agency delivers mockups and assets, but the Dev role implements them as Web Components following IFD patterns.

## User Personas (Design-Relevant)

From [Advocate](v0.3.5__advocate.md):

| Persona | Design Priority |
|---------|----------------|
| Privacy-conscious professional | Trust signals, transparency, minimal UI |
| Security team member | Technical details, compliance info |
| Journalist / activist | Simplicity, speed, anonymity |
| Early adopter / community member | Landing page, social proof, vision |
