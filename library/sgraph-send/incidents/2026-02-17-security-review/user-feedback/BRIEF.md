# User Feedback: Relationship Management

**Type:** Stakeholder relationship
**Status:** Open

---

## User A — Security Reviewer

**Profile:** Security professional with code review expertise
**How they found us:** LinkedIn direct message with access token `linkedin-user`
**What they did:** Full-stack security review across all IFD versions, delivered via SG/Send
**Stakeholder status:** Key stakeholder — report back with resolution status

### Validated Value Proposition

> "I can't tell you how many times I've needed something like this. I mean if you use Signal, Proton, or whatever else, the other party needs the same tech, which is not always the case, right?"

This captures SG/Send's primary differentiator in the user's own words: the recipient doesn't need to install anything, create an account, or use a specific app.

### UX Observation

Report was sent as markdown text. Download page displayed raw markdown (literal `**bold**` and `#` headers). Markdown-to-HTML rendering needed.

### Relationship Plan

| Action | Owner | When |
|--------|-------|------|
| Share incident brief: "does this capture it all?" | Human | Immediate |
| Report fix status as items resolve | Sherpa | Ongoing |
| Invite to review deployed fixes | Sherpa | After Wave 1-2 |
| Credit publicly (with consent) | Ambassador + Journalist | After consent obtained |
| Voice interview (brief ready) | Journalist | When User A is available |
