# SGraph Send: Investor Briefing Pack

**Version:** v0.5.8
**Date:** 21 February 2026
**Classification:** Confidential -- for investor audiences
**Prepared by:** Alchemist (Town Planner Team)
**Product:** SGraph Send (SG/Send) -- [send.sgraph.ai](https://send.sgraph.ai)

## The Opportunity in One Paragraph

SGraph Send is building the encrypted communication layer that enterprises are missing. Today, confidential files -- term sheets, NDAs, financial reports, credentials -- travel via email, Slack, and WhatsApp, where the server can read every word. SG/Send encrypts everything in the browser before upload. The server never sees the plaintext. As of this week, we have achieved browser-based Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): recipients can be addressed by their public key, eliminating key exchange entirely. No app required. No account required. The recipient just needs a browser. This is what an investor group called "a killer feature" when they described exactly this capability before we built it.

## What the Product Does

SG/Send is a zero-knowledge encrypted file and message transfer service. "Zero-knowledge" means the server stores only encrypted bytes -- even with full infrastructure access, the data cannot be read.

**How it works:**

1. Sender opens SG/Send in a browser -- no app, no account
2. Drops a file or types a message
3. Content is encrypted in the browser (AES-256-GCM, Web Crypto API) before upload
4. Sender receives a link and a decryption key -- shares them via separate channels
5. Recipient opens the link, enters the key, decrypts in their browser -- no app, no account

**The server never sees the data.** Not during upload, not during storage, not during download. The encryption key never leaves the sender's device.

This architecture has been independently validated by a senior security professional with 25 years of experience, who described the UX as "foolproof -- like Google search" and the cryptography as "the correct implementation."

As that reviewer observed: "I can't tell you how many times I've needed something like this. If you use Signal, Proton, or whatever else, the other party needs the same tech, which is not always the case."

That last point is the key differentiator. **The recipient does not need to install anything.** No app. No account. No portal login. Just a browser. This is what makes SG/Send different from every encrypted communication tool on the market.

## The PKI Milestone: What Changed This Week

On 20 February 2026, SG/Send achieved its first browser-to-browser PKI encrypted message exchange. Two browser windows on two different networks exchanged encrypted messages -- and the server never saw a single plaintext character.

**What was built:**

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Key generation** | RSA-OAEP 4096-bit encryption keys + ECDSA P-256 signing keys, generated entirely in the browser |
| **Non-extractable private keys** | Private keys are marked non-extractable at generation -- not even the JavaScript that created them can read them back |
| **Hybrid encryption** | Per-message AES-256-GCM session key wrapped in RSA-OAEP -- the standard pattern used by PGP, S/MIME, and TLS |
| **Digital signatures** | Every encrypted message is signed with the sender's ECDSA key, providing authentication and non-repudiation |
| **Zero external dependencies** | Everything uses the browser's native Web Crypto API. No libraries. No frameworks. No supply chain risk. |
| **Browser coverage** | >97% of browsers support the Web Crypto API natively |

**What this means for the product:**

Before PKI, SG/Send required the sender to share a decryption key via a separate channel (text message, phone call). This works but adds friction.

With PKI, the sender selects the recipient's public key and encrypts. The recipient opens the link and their browser decrypts automatically using their private key. **No key to share. No second channel. One link, one click.**

The server still never sees the plaintext or any private key. Zero-knowledge is preserved.

## The Technology Moat

### 1. The Encryption Trilemma -- Solved

Enterprise encrypted communication faces a fundamental tension between three properties. Every existing solution sacrifices at least one:

| Property | What It Means | Who Sacrifices It |
|---|---|---|
| **Zero-knowledge server** | The server cannot read the data | Intralinks, Datasite, most data rooms |
| **Multi-user access** | Multiple recipients can access the same content | Standard PGP, Signal (one-to-one only) |
| **Revocable access** | Access can be withdrawn after it has been granted | Standard PKI wrapping (you cannot unknow a key) |

SG/Send's architecture resolves this through a **Secure Pod** -- a dedicated, hardened intermediary that decrypts content, re-encrypts it per-user with a unique per-request key, and then forgets the plaintext. The storage server remains zero-knowledge. The pod operates in an isolated infrastructure boundary. The user never holds a key that works on stored content.

This is the architectural foundation for enterprise-grade encrypted data rooms with revocable access -- a capability that existing data room providers (Intralinks: GBP 3,000-10,000/month) cannot offer with zero-knowledge encryption.

> *Source: [`v0.5.0__review__secure-pod-architecture.md`](../../team/roles/architect/reviews/26-02-21/v0.5.0__review__secure-pod-architecture.md) -- Architect review, 21 Feb 2026*

### 2. Tamper-Evident Audit Trails

Every trust relationship and every access event is recorded in a hash-chained commit log -- the same principle that underpins blockchain, but without the overhead. Each entry includes the SHA-256 hash of the previous entry, making retroactive tampering detectable. The audit trail is cryptographically verifiable and legally defensible.

This means an investor using SG/Send's data room can prove: this specific document was shared with this specific person at this specific time, and no one tampered with the record after the fact.

### 3. Open Source (Apache 2.0)

The entire codebase is open source under the Apache 2.0 licence. Anyone can verify the encryption implementation. For a zero-knowledge tool, a security reviewer told us: "that's not optional."

Open source provides:
- **Verifiable security claims** -- any expert can audit the cryptography
- **Frictionless enterprise procurement** -- no vendor lock-in objections, no legal review delays
- **Community trust** -- the encryption does what we say it does, provably
- **Partner ecosystem** -- anyone can deploy, extend, and integrate

## The Market

### The Problem

Every day, confidential documents travel through channels where the server can read them:

| Channel | Can the server read your files? | Persistent? | Controllable? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Email** | Yes -- plaintext in transit and at rest | Yes -- indefinitely | No -- forwarded freely |
| **WhatsApp** | E2E encrypted between users, but cloud backups are unencrypted by default | Yes -- backed up to iCloud/Google Drive | No -- recipients can screenshot, forward |
| **Slack** | Yes -- Slack stores plaintext, administrators can access | Yes -- searchable history | No -- workspace admins see everything |
| **WeTransfer** | No E2E encryption -- server can read files | Yes -- until expiry | Limited |
| **Data rooms (Intralinks, Datasite)** | Yes -- provider holds encryption keys | Yes | Limited -- provider controls access |

No mainstream tool offers: end-to-end encryption + no app required for recipient + self-hostable + open source + verifiable. SG/Send is the only product in this intersection.

### Market Sizing

| Segment | Size | SG/Send Positioning |
|---|---|---|

## The Operating Model: One Human, 19 AI Agent Roles

SG/Send is built by one human (project lead, 20+ years in application security, former OWASP leader) directing 19 specialised AI agent roles organised into three teams.

### Team Structure

| Team | Focus | Roles |
|---|---|---|
| **Explorer** | Research, experiment, build new capabilities | Architect, Developer, QA, AppSec, DPO, GRC, Conductor, Journalist, Historian, Librarian, Ambassador, Advocate, Sherpa, Cartographer, Designer |
| **Villager** | Stabilise, harden, deploy to production | Same roles + Translator |
| **Town Planner** | Long-term strategy, investment, business development | Alchemist (this role) |

### Why This Matters for Investors

1. **Structural cost efficiency** -- one person producing the output typically requiring 10+ specialists. Operating burn rate is a fraction of a comparable team.

2. **Comprehensive coverage** -- security reviews, architecture decisions, compliance analysis, marketing materials, incident response, user research -- all produced by specialised agents with defined responsibilities and boundaries.

3. **Institutional memory** -- every decision, every brief, every analysis is a versioned file in git. The project's knowledge base is 200+ structured documents. New sessions pick up from the accumulated knowledge, not from scratch.

4. **Speed** -- from investor meeting to working PKI demo: 24 hours. From security incident to production hotfix: 100 minutes. The feedback loop between "what to build" and "it is built" is measured in hours, not sprints.

5. **Quality gate** -- every output is reviewed by the human project lead before it enters the system. The AI accelerates production; the human ensures quality.

## Product Direction: Three Steps

### Step 1: Key Discovery and Public Registry (Next Build -- ~5 Days)

Users generate key pairs in the browser and publish their public key with a friendly short code (e.g., `A7X9F2`). Senders look up recipients by short code, QR code, or registry page. PKI encryption becomes as easy as entering a phone number.

**Status:** Implementation plan complete. 5-phase build covering shared utility extraction, backend API, publish button, lookup page, registry page, QR codes.

> *Source: [`v0.5.0__implementation-plan__key-discovery-and-registry.md`](../../team/roles/dev/reviews/26-02-21/v0.5.0__implementation-plan__key-discovery-and-registry.md)*

### Step 2: LLM Integration -- "Claude, Send This Securely"

The workflow an investor explicitly requested: compose a document in Claude, say "send this to [founder] via SG/Send," and it is encrypted, uploaded, and delivered. Implementations via CLI tool (`sg_send`) and MCP Server (Model Context Protocol).

This preserves the security model: the user already trusts Claude with the plaintext (they composed it there). No new trust boundary is introduced.

**Status:** Implementation plan complete. CLI tool first (works with all LLMs immediately), MCP server wraps the same code.

### Step 3: Enterprise Data Rooms with Revocable Access

Zero-knowledge encrypted data rooms where multiple users access shared documents, access can be revoked after granting, and every access event is recorded in a tamper-evident audit trail. Built on the Secure Pod architecture (see Technology Moat section).

Phased implementation:
- **Phase 1 (Prototype):** Separate AWS account, Lambda-based pod, ~6-7 days of development
- **Phase 2 (Early customers):** Hardened with CloudTrail, SCPs, rate limiting, monitoring
- **Phase 3 (Enterprise):** AWS Nitro Enclave with cryptographic attestation
- **Phase 4 (Regulated):** Hardware Security Module for FIPS 140 compliance

**Status:** Architecture designed and reviewed. Implementation gated on customer demand signal.

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Encryption** | AES-256-GCM + RSA-OAEP 4096 + ECDSA P-256, Web Crypto API | Military-grade encryption, browser-native, zero dependencies |
| **Runtime** | Python 3.12, FastAPI, serverless (AWS Lambda) | Scales to zero. No idle costs. New instances in minutes. |
| **Storage** | Memory-FS abstraction (pluggable: memory, disk, S3) | Application code has no idea which backend is active. Clean separation. |
| **Frontend** | Vanilla JS + Web Components, zero framework dependencies | No React, no build toolchain, no framework churn. The browser IS the platform. |
| **Deployment** | 7 targets: Lambda, Docker, GCP Cloud Run, Fargate, EC2, PyPI, CLI | Same codebase deploys anywhere. Multi-cloud from day one. |
| **Testing** | pytest, 111+ tests, no mocks, full in-memory stack in ~100ms | Real implementations tested, not simulations of implementations. |
| **Licence** | Apache 2.0 (open source) | Verifiable claims. Frictionless procurement. No lock-in. |
