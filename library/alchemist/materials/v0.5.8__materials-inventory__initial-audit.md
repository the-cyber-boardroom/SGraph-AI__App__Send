# Alchemist Materials Inventory: Initial Audit

**Version:** v0.5.8
**Date:** 21 February 2026
**Role:** Alchemist (Town Planner Team)
**Type:** Materials inventory and gap analysis (Workstream-1, Tasks 1-2)
**Status:** FIRST TRANSMUTATION -- baseline inventory established

---

## Executive Summary

This document catalogues every existing investor-facing and business-facing material in the SGraph Send repository, assesses its currency and quality, identifies gaps, and maps the transmutation provenance (which technical documents feed into which investor materials).

**Findings:**

- **14 investor/business-facing materials exist** across three locations: `for-ambassador/`, `team/roles/ambassador/`, and `team/roles/journalist/`
- **None reflect the current state (v0.5.0+)** -- all were written at v0.4.4 to v0.4.25
- **The PKI milestone (20 Feb) is the biggest unrepresented achievement** -- working browser-to-browser PKI encryption with zero dependencies
- **The chain-of-trust architecture and secure pod design (21 Feb) are entirely absent** from investor materials
- **6 source documents (technical gold) exist** that have never been transmuted into investor language
- **The agentic team has grown from 18 to 19+ roles** across three teams (Explorer, Villager, Town Planner) -- materials still reference 18 roles and two teams

## Part 1: Complete Materials Inventory

### A. For-Ambassador Documents (External-Facing Briefs)

| # | File | Version | Date | Audience | Currency | Quality | Notes |
|---|------|---------|------|----------|----------|---------|-------|
| 1 | [`v0.4.4__ambassador__sg-send-for-investors-today.md`](../../../team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/17/for-ambassador/v0.4.4__ambassador__sg-send-for-investors-today.md) | v0.4.4 | 16 Feb | Investment groups | STALE | HIGH | Strong problem statement, five concrete use cases, deployment options, cost section. Missing: PKI capability, user quotes, asymmetry argument. URL inconsistency (sgraph.com vs sgraph.ai). |
| 2 | [`v0.4.4__ambassador__sg-send-for-investors-coming-soon.md`](../../../team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/17/for-ambassador/v0.4.4__ambassador__sg-send-for-investors-coming-soon.md) | v0.4.4 | 16 Feb | Investment groups | STALE | MEDIUM-HIGH | Lists PKI as "coming soon" -- it is now BUILT and DEMONSTRATED. Several "near-term" claims need timeline verification. Missing: competitive context (Intralinks pricing). |
| 3 | [`v0.4.4__ambassador__sg-send-for-investors-future-vision.md`](../../../team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/17/for-ambassador/v0.4.4__ambassador__sg-send-for-investors-future-vision.md) | v0.4.4 | 16 Feb | Investment groups | PARTIALLY STALE | HIGH | Vision document with translation, knowledge extraction, interactive workflows, governance dashboard. The vision is still valid but some "future" items have moved closer (PKI is done, data room architecture is designed). |
| 4 | [`v0.4.7__ambassador__sg-send-for-accountants.md`](../../../team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/17/for-ambassador/v0.4.7__ambassador__sg-send-for-accountants.md) | v0.4.7 | 17 Feb | Accountants | PARTIALLY STALE | VERY HIGH | Strongest single-audience document per Ambassador assessment. Regulatory alignment table is excellent. Missing: PKI capability update, user quotes. |
| 5 | [`v0.4.7__briefing__agentic-team-setup-and-workflows.md`](../../../team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/17/for-ambassador/v0.4.7__briefing__agentic-team-setup-and-workflows.md) | v0.4.7 | 17 Feb | External/investors | STALE | HIGH | 7,500-word document on agentic team methodology. Metrics now outdated (was 75+ docs, 18 roles -- now 200+ docs, 19+ roles, 3 teams). Strong thought leadership asset but needs audience-specific versions. |

### B. Ambassador Role Reviews (Investor-Targeted)

| # | File | Version | Date | Purpose | Currency | Quality |
|---|------|---------|------|---------|----------|---------|
| 6 | [`v0.4.12__response-to-ambassador-briefs__17-feb.md`](../../../team/roles/ambassador/reviews/26-02-19/v0.4.12__response-to-ambassador-briefs__17-feb.md) | v0.4.12 | 19 Feb | Comprehensive assessment of all 5 for-ambassador docs, gap analysis, messaging matrix | CURRENT (as analysis) | VERY HIGH | The most thorough messaging assessment in the repo. Identifies gaps, recommends quote placement, produces consolidated messaging matrix. Not investor-facing itself, but essential reference for producing investor materials. |
| 7 | [`v0.4.17__investor-proposal__direction-and-milestones.md`](../../../team/roles/ambassador/reviews/26-02-20/v0.4.17__investor-proposal__direction-and-milestones.md) | v0.4.17 | 20 Feb | Direct investor-facing proposal for follow-up meeting | PARTIALLY STALE | VERY HIGH | Most investor-ready document in the repo. Three-step direction (PKI, LLM integration, dedicated instances). Competitive comparison table. Milestone table. Missing: PKI is now BUILT (document says "technical research complete"), chain-of-trust and secure pod architectures. |

### C. Journalist Articles (Externally Publishable)

| # | File | Version | Date | Purpose | Currency | Quality |
|---|------|---------|------|---------|----------|---------|
| 8 | [`v0.4.25__article__pki-milestone.md`](../../../team/roles/journalist/reviews/26-02-20/v0.4.25__article__pki-milestone.md) | v0.4.25 | 20 Feb | Narrative of first browser-to-browser PKI exchange | CURRENT | HIGH | Strong narrative piece. Includes LinkedIn post link, algorithm details, performance metrics. Usable for investor communications as a milestone proof point. |
| 9 | [`v0.4.12__article__100-minute-security-hotfix.md`](../../../team/roles/journalist/reviews/26-02-19/v0.4.12__article__100-minute-security-hotfix.md) | v0.4.12 | 19 Feb | Incident response story (INC-003) | CURRENT | HIGH | Demonstrates operational maturity: 100-minute incident response, 6 IFD versions patched simultaneously. Strong credibility material for security-conscious investors. |
| 10 | [`v0.4.16__article__from-leak-to-feature-full-arc.md`](../../../team/roles/journalist/reviews/26-02-19/v0.4.16__article__from-leak-to-feature-full-arc.md) | v0.4.16 | 19 Feb | Full arc narrative from INC-003 through INC-004 to PKI | CURRENT | HIGH | Shows how incidents become features. Good "immune system" narrative for investors who want to see process maturity. |

### D. Strategic / Vision Documents (Usable as Source Material)

| # | File | Version | Date | Purpose | Currency | Quality |
|---|------|---------|------|---------|----------|---------|
| 11 | [`secure-send-strategic-opportunities.md`](../../../library/docs/_to_process/secure-send-strategic-opportunities.md) | v1.0 DRAFT | Feb 2026 | 15 strategic proposals ranked by impact-to-effort | PARTIALLY STALE | HIGH | Comprehensive strategic vision with CLI/SDK, MCP server, one-time secrets, data rooms, P2P, regulated verticals, revenue models. Written before PKI was built. References old repo name (MGraph-AI). |
| 12 | [`v0.4.17__business-incident__investor-pki-claude-integration.md`](../../../team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/20/v0.4.17__business-incident__investor-pki-claude-integration.md) | v0.4.17 | 19 Feb | Business opportunity brief from investor meeting | CURRENT | VERY HIGH | The source brief. Contains investor's exact words, their use case (NDA/term sheet to founders), the "SigSend" name emergence, the Claude integration request. B3-as-B1 classification. Essential provenance for all investor materials. |
| 13 | [`v0.4.17__brief__pki-strategy-and-investor-deployment.md`](../../../team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/20/v0.4.17__brief__pki-strategy-and-investor-deployment.md) | v0.4.17 | 19 Feb | PKI as strategic direction + dedicated deployment plan | CURRENT | HIGH | Details browser-based key management, PKI encryption flow, short codes, Claude skill integration, dedicated deployment for investor group. Includes research task list and deliverables for next meeting. |
| 14 | [`sgraph-ai-naming-branding-strategy.md`](../../../library/docs/_to_process/sgraph-ai-naming-branding-strategy.md) | -- | Feb 2026 | Naming and branding strategy | PARTIALLY STALE | MEDIUM | Branding considerations. References older naming. Useful for brand narrative context. |

## Part 2: Technical Source Documents (The "Gold" to Transmute)

These documents contain the technical substance that investor materials must be built upon. They are the provenance chain -- every investor-facing claim must trace back to one of these.

### PKI Architecture (Primary Gold Source)

| # | Source Document | Key Investor-Relevant Content | Transmutation Status |
|---|----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| T1 | [`v0.5.0__review__chain-of-trust-architecture.md`](../../../team/roles/architect/reviews/26-02-21/v0.5.0__review__chain-of-trust-architecture.md) | Trust graphs, hash-chained audit trails, revocation model, key rotation with identity anchors. 6 architectural decisions. Concrete `Type_Safe` schemas. | NOT TRANSMUTED -- investor materials do not mention chain-of-trust, trust graphs, or tamper-evident audit trails. This is a major gap. |
| T2 | [`v0.5.0__review__secure-pod-architecture.md`](../../../team/roles/architect/reviews/26-02-21/v0.5.0__review__secure-pod-architecture.md) | Encryption trilemma solved. Multi-user revocable encryption via pod intermediary. Five implementation options evaluated (Nitro Enclave, separate AWS account, HSM, client-side, cross-cloud). Phase roadmap from prototype to enterprise. | NOT TRANSMUTED -- the data room architecture with the secure pod is the most compelling enterprise story and it is entirely absent from investor materials. |
| T3 | [`v0.5.0__review__pki-architecture-security.md`](../../../team/roles/appsec/reviews/26-02-21/v0.5.0__review__pki-architecture-security.md) | 25 security findings across all PKI briefs. 2 critical, 5 high, 11 medium, 7 low. Proof-of-possession authentication. Registry flooding prevention. | NOT TRANSMUTED -- "we identified and are addressing 25 security findings before production deployment" is powerful credibility material. Shows security rigour ahead of most Series A companies. |
| T4 | [`v0.5.0__debrief__briefs-21-feb-pki-architecture.md`](../../../team/humans/dinis_cruz/debriefs/02/21/v0.5.0__debrief__briefs-21-feb-pki-architecture.md) | Summary of all 21 Feb architecture work. Implementation plan for key discovery (~5 days). Recommended reading order for technical due diligence. | NOT TRANSMUTED -- useful as a guided tour for technical due diligence. |
| T5 | [`v0.4.25__article__pki-milestone.md`](../../../team/roles/journalist/reviews/26-02-20/v0.4.25__article__pki-milestone.md) | First browser-to-browser PKI exchange achieved. RSA-OAEP 4096 + ECDSA P-256. Non-extractable keys. Zero external dependencies. LinkedIn announcement published. | PARTIALLY TRANSMUTED -- the article exists but is not integrated into investor materials. The milestone is not mentioned in any investor-facing document. |
| T6 | [`v0.5.0__debrief__villager-catch-up-19-to-21-feb.md`](../../../team/humans/dinis_cruz/debriefs/02/21/v0.5.0__debrief__villager-catch-up-19-to-21-feb.md) | 92 commits in 3 days. Two incidents resolved. PKI MVP built and deployed. 41-item Villager backlog. Production status across all roles. | NOT TRANSMUTED -- "92 commits in 3 days" and "PKI from concept to production in 24 hours" are powerful traction data points. |

### Supporting Technical Documents

| # | Source Document | Investor-Relevant Content |
|---|----------------|---------------------------|
| T7 | Architecture briefs (v0.4.27 series) | Key discovery and public registry, chain-of-trust and key graphs, secure pod multi-user encryption |
| T8 | Dev implementation plan (v0.5.0) | 5-phase build plan for key discovery. Demonstrates engineering planning discipline. |
| T9 | GRC risk assessment (v0.5.0) | Auth model transition risk assessment. Shows governance maturity. |
| T10 | Incident reports (INC-003, INC-004) | 100-minute hotfix, data breach containment, incident response process. Shows operational maturity. |

## Part 3: Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (Must Address for Credible Investor Pack)

| # | Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
|---|-----|--------|----------------|
| G1 | **No document reflects the PKI milestone achievement** | The single most important investor validation point (PKI was what they asked for) is not in any investor-facing material | Produce investor briefing pack v1 with PKI as the headline (Task-3 deliverable) |
| G2 | **Chain-of-trust and secure pod architectures absent** | These are the strategic differentiators (encryption trilemma solved, tamper-evident audit trails) that position SG/Send ahead of competitors | Include in investor briefing pack as "technology moat" section |
| G3 | **No one-page executive summary exists** | Cannot follow up after meetings with a concise document | Produce one-pager as part of Workstream-5, Task-21 |
| G4 | **No updated competitive comparison** | The v0.4.17 proposal has a good table but does not include Tresorit, Bitwarden Send, or 1Password shared vaults | Update competitive table with current landscape |
| G5 | **Agentic team metrics outdated** | Materials reference 18 roles, 75+ documents, 5 days. Reality is now 19+ roles, 200+ documents, 3 teams, 9 days | Update metrics in all materials |
| G6 | **Financial model / unit economics absent** | No document presents cost-per-deployment, gross margin, or revenue projection | Coordinate with Accountant role (Workstream-4, Task-17) |
| G7 | **No demo script exists** | Investor demos are unscripted, reducing impact | Produce demo script for PKI capability demo (Workstream-3, Task-14) |

### Important Gaps

| # | Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
|---|-----|--------|----------------|
| G8 | **User A quote not integrated into any external material** | Most powerful third-party validation is unused | Integrate per Ambassador's Part 5 recommendations |
| G9 | **Branding clarification needed in materials** | Written materials should use "SG/Send" consistently; "SigSend" is the spoken/verbal form only | Ensure all written materials use "SG/Send". "SigSend" is correct for verbal usage only (per human decision 21 Feb). |
| G10 | **Security review completion not positioned as credibility** | 25 security findings identified and being addressed is ahead of most early-stage companies | Include as "security posture" section in investor materials |
| G11 | **No per-investor relationship tracking** | Pipeline tracking not set up in `library/alchemist/investors/` | Set up per Workstream-3, Tasks 11-12 |
| G12 | **CC BY footer missing from all for-ambassador documents** | Required per partner ecosystem brief | Add to all external materials |

### Nice-to-Have Gaps

| # | Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
|---|-----|--------|----------------|
| G13 | **No case study from User A** | A security professional who used SG/Send to deliver their own security review is a compelling story | Commission from Journalist role |
| G14 | **No video demo** | 60-second screen recording worth more than written descriptions | Commission from Designer/Developer |
| G15 | **No vertical-specific materials beyond accountants** | Legal, healthcare, HR verticals untapped | Future Alchemist work |

## Part 4: Transmutation Provenance Map

This map shows which technical documents feed into which investor-facing claims. Every investor-facing assertion must trace back to a source.

```
TECHNICAL SOURCE                          INVESTOR CLAIM
=================                         ==============

## Part 5: Recommendations

### Priority 1: Produce Investor Briefing Pack v1 (This Session)

Deliverable: `v0.5.8__investor-briefing-pack__pki-milestone.md`

This pack must:
1. Lead with the PKI achievement as the headline (what investors asked for, delivered)
2. Present the chain-of-trust and secure pod as strategic differentiators
3. Include updated metrics (200+ documents, 19+ roles, 3 teams)
4. Integrate User A's quote and the "Signal for the web" framing
5. Include the competitive comparison table with current positioning
6. Reference all source documents (transmutation provenance)

### Priority 2: Update Existing Materials

The three for-ambassador investor documents (Today/Coming Soon/Future Vision) need v0.5.8 updates to reflect:
- PKI is BUILT, not "coming soon"
- Chain-of-trust architecture is DESIGNED
- Secure pod (data room) architecture is DESIGNED
- Agentic team has grown to 19+ roles across 3 teams
- 92 commits in 3 days, 200+ documents

### Priority 3: Produce Missing Materials

In order of priority:
1. One-page executive summary
2. Demo script for PKI capability
3. Updated competitive landscape table
4. Per-investor relationship folder for B1 investor group

---

## Appendix: Materials by Currency Status

### CURRENT (reflects v0.5.0+ state)

- PKI milestone article (v0.4.25) -- describes the achievement accurately
- Ambassador assessment of for-ambassador briefs (v0.4.12) -- analysis is still valid
- Business incident brief (v0.4.17) -- historical record, always current
- PKI strategy brief (v0.4.17) -- historical record, always current

### PARTIALLY STALE (core content valid, needs updates)

- Investor proposal: direction and milestones (v0.4.17) -- PKI step now complete
- For-investors future vision (v0.4.4) -- some "future" items now closer
- For-accountants (v0.4.7) -- PKI and other features now available
- Agentic team briefing (v0.4.7) -- metrics outdated
- Strategic opportunities (v1.0 DRAFT) -- references old repo name, pre-PKI

### STALE (needs significant revision)

- For-investors today (v0.4.4) -- does not mention PKI, which is now the product's defining capability
- For-investors coming soon (v0.4.4) -- lists PKI as coming soon when it is built
- From-leak-to-feature article (v0.4.16) -- still valid narrative but not updated with PKI context
