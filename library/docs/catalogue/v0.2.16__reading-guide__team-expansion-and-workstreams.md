- **Team grows from 13 to 17 roles** -- four new roles added: Advocate, Sherpa, Ambassador, DPO
- **User-facing capability established** -- the team now has dedicated roles for user representation (Advocate), user guidance and trail observation (Sherpa), and growth/market outreach (Ambassador)
- **Legal/regulatory capability established** -- the DPO (Data Protection Officer) role adds UK GDPR compliance as a first-class concern
- **6 new workstreams defined** -- DPO audit, Google Analytics, maximum observability, tabletop exercise, synthetic users, Playwright-as-a-service
- **"Friendlies" MVP milestone defined** -- the next iteration target is a product good enough to share with invited beta users
- **Product scope expands** -- public key encryption, text mode, self-hosted scenarios, multi-language support, accessibility theming

Manages competitive intelligence, organic/viral growth strategy, outreach campaigns (with budget), community engagement, brand positioning. Does not do hard sales. Tracks viral coefficient, conversion funnel, campaign ROI. |
| D4 | **Role Definition: DPO** | `v0.2.16__role-definition__dpo.md` | Defines the Data Protection Officer role -- owns data protection under UK GDPR, DPA 2018, and PECR. Legally independent role. Audits all personal data processing, writes privacy wording, conducts DPIAs, manages breach notification (72-hour window to ICO). First task: IP address audit across AWS infrastructure. |

### Category 2: Team Introduction (1 document)

## Per-Role Reading Matrix

The 17 roles and what each must read from this batch. Reading levels:

- **MUST** -- changes your responsibilities, adds dependencies, or redefines your scope. Not optional.
- **SHOULD** -- provides important context for your work. Strongly recommended.
- **REC** -- nice to have. Broadens understanding of the overall direction.

## Recommended Reading Order

### Phase 1: Understand the New Roles (read first)

Read the role definitions before anything else. Each defines ownership boundaries, interaction patterns with every other role, and Issues FS integration points.

1. **D1** `v0.2.16__role-definition__advocate.md` -- the Advocate owns the customer entity internally
2. **D2** `v0.2.16__role-definition__sherpa.md` -- the Sherpa guides users and reads behavioural trails
3. **D3** `v0.2.16__role-definition__ambassador.md` -- the Ambassador owns growth and market outreach
4. **D4** `v0.2.16__role-definition__dpo.md` -- the DPO owns UK GDPR compliance (legally defined role)

### Phase 2: Understand the Team Structure Change

5. **D5** `v0.2.16__intro__three-new-roles-advocate-sherpa-ambassador.md` -- how the 3 user-facing roles fit into the existing team, with boundary maps, lifecycle diagrams, and per-role impact summaries

### Phase 3: Understand the New Workstreams

6. **D6** `v0.2.16__briefs__dpo-observability-tabletop-synthetic-users-playwright.md` -- the 6 interconnected workstreams that operationalise the new roles

### Phase 4: Supporting Briefs (context for specific roles)

7. **D7** `v0.2.16__briefs__sgraph-send-user-research-personas-and-interviews.md` -- the user research methodology (Advocate-relevant)
8. **D9** `v0.2.16__daily-brief__sgraph-send-next-mvp-friendlies.md` -- the next MVP milestone and 4 workstreams (Dev, Designer, Architect-relevant)
9. **D8** `v0.2.16__briefs__sgraph-send-public-key-text-mode-self-hosted.md` -- product feature expansion (Architect, Dev, AppSec-relevant)
10. **D10** `v0.2.10__review-of-user-site-mvp.md` -- the MVP review that triggered this batch (baseline context)

## Cross-References to Existing Documents

These new documents reference, supersede, or extend the following existing documents:

### Documents Directly Referenced

| Referenced Document | Referenced By | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/11/v0.2.4__briefs__sgraph-send-devops-deployment-productization.md` | D10 (MVP Review) | DevOps tasks link to this deployment brief |
| `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/10/v0.1.4__briefs__focus-on-mvp-release-infrastructure.md` | D10 (MVP Review) | Current sprint focus defined here |
| `library/dependencies/osbot-utils/type_safe/` | D10 (MVP Review) | Dev must read Type_Safe guides before refactoring |
| `library/dependencies/memory-fs/` | D10 (MVP Review) | Dev must leverage Memory-FS abstractions |

### Documents Affected / Superseded

| Affected Document | Impact |
|---|---|
| **CLAUDE.md** (project root) | Must be updated: role count changes from 10 to 14+, "Current Sprint" section needs updating to reflect friendlies MVP focus and 6 new workstreams |
| `library/roadmap/phases/v0.1.1__phase-overview.md` | Phase roadmap needs update to incorporate friendlies MVP milestone and the 6 new workstreams |
| `library/docs/specs/README.md` | Specs index needs entries for public key encryption, text mode, self-hosted deployment |
| `team/roles/librarian/reviews/26-02-12/v0.2.15__master-index__mvp-review-briefings.md` | This index covers only D10 (MVP Review). The current reading guide covers the full batch of 10. |
| `team/roles/librarian/reviews/26-02-10/v0.2.1__master-index__infrastructure-brief-responses.md` | Previous master index. This reading guide is its successor for the v0.2.16 batch. |

### Role Definitions That Need Updating

The intro document (D5) and the 6-workstreams brief (D6) specify how each of the 13 existing roles interacts with the 4 new roles. The following existing role descriptions (if they have formal definitions) need updating to include these interactions:

| Role | New Interactions |
|---|---|
| Conductor | Integrate Advocate into decision review, align campaigns with releases, sequence DPO reviews, coordinate 6 new workstreams |
| Architect | Accept Advocate design challenges, accept DPO data protection reviews at design stage, design Playwright-as-a-service |
| Dev | Receive friction-based requirements from Sherpa, growth-critical gaps from Ambassador, implement text mode, Playwright service |
| QA | Share persona simulation results with Advocate, include Sherpa side-effect detection in regression, write synthetic user Playwright scripts |
| DevOps | Provide user-behaviour observability for Sherpa (beyond uptime), enable maximum AWS logging, share logging inventory with DPO |
| Designer | Accept Advocate and Sherpa review of proposals, collaborate with Ambassador on market-facing materials, design cookie consent if needed |
| CISO | Lead tabletop exercise with DPO as co-driver, share attacker trails with Sherpa for UX insights |
| GRC | Coordinate with DPO on risk register, formally accept data protection risks, support tabletop exercise |
| AppSec | Support tabletop with vulnerability analysis, review synthetic user scripts, threat model URL hash approach and public key features |
| Journalist | Ambassador becomes primary strategic collaborator, Sherpa commissions user-facing content, DPO approves all privacy claims |
| Historian | Record team expansion milestone, document tabletop exercise, track Advocate design-review objections |
| Cartographer | Collaborate with Sherpa on change-impact analysis (code blast radius + behavioural trails), visualise tabletop exercise gaps |
| Librarian | Catalogue 3 new data streams (Advocate personas, Sherpa friction logs, Ambassador competitive intel), catalogue 6 workstream artefacts, maintain DPO compliance records |

### User Research Brief (D7) Supersession Note

The user research brief (D7) originally proposed a single "Marketing" role to own personas, interviews, and growth. The three role definitions (D1-D3) **supersede** this by splitting the responsibilities:

| D7 Proposed (Marketing) | Now Owned By |
|---|---|
| Customer personas | **Advocate** |
| Interview design | **Advocate** |
| User research synthesis | **Advocate** |
| Friendlies outreach | **Ambassador** |
| Growth and conversion | **Ambassador** |
| Friendlies onboarding | **Sherpa** |
| Friction data collection | **Sherpa** |
| Content marketing | **Journalist** (briefed by Ambassador) |
