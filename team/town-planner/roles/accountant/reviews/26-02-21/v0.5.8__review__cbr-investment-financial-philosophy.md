# Accountant Review: CBR Investment — Financial Philosophy and Pricing Discovery Framework

**Version:** v0.5.8
**Date:** 21 February 2026
**Role:** Accountant (Town Planner team)
**Source:** `https://github.com/the-cyber-boardroom/cbr-investment.git`
**Type:** Financial philosophy assessment and framework adoption for SG/Send

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The CBR investment repository contains a mature financial philosophy that directly applies to SG/Send. The core insight: **do not fabricate financial projections. Discover pricing through hypothesis-driven development.** This is not a gap in the financial model -- it IS the financial model.

The Accountant's role is to adopt this philosophy, apply it to SG/Send's specific economics, and produce financial materials that are honest, measurable, and credible to investors who are tired of hockey-stick fantasies.

## 2. The CBR Financial Philosophy (Key Principles to Adopt)

### 2.1 The Serverless Company Model

**Source:** `docs/strategy/serverless-financial-model-and-growth-strategy.md`

The foundational principle: **a serverless architecture eliminates the "kill date."**

Traditional startups have a burn rate and a runway. When the runway ends, the company dies -- regardless of product quality. This creates pressure to grow revenue before the product is ready, leading to premature scaling, feature bloat, and misaligned incentives.

SG/Send's Lambda-based architecture has the same property as CBR:
- **Near-zero idle costs** -- Lambda charges per invocation, S3 charges per GB stored
- **Costs scale with usage** -- more users = more revenue AND more cost, but the ratio is favourable
- **No kill date** -- the product can exist indefinitely at near-zero cost while discovering product-market fit

**Accountant implication:** Our financial narrative is NOT "we need X months of runway." It is "our costs are proportional to our value delivery, and we can operate indefinitely while discovering the right pricing model."

### 2.2 Hypothesis-Driven Development

**Source:** `docs/strategy/serverless-financial-model-and-growth-strategy.md` (Section: Development Discipline Framework)

Every feature must create a **billable unit** -- a measurable, chargeable unit of value. Features that do not create billable units are not built.

**The discipline:**
1. Before building a feature, write a hypothesis: "If we build X, users will pay Y per Z"
2. Build the minimum version to test the hypothesis
3. Measure whether users actually pay
4. If yes, invest further. If no, pivot or kill the feature.

**SG/Send billable units (proposed):**

| Billable Unit | Description | Hypothesis |
|---|---|---|
| **Transfer** | One file upload + encrypted storage + download link | "Users will pay per transfer above a free tier" |
| **Storage-day** | One day of encrypted file storage | "Users will pay for extended storage beyond default expiry" |
| **PKI key exchange** | One PKI-authenticated transfer between verified parties | "Enterprise users will pay a premium for PKI-verified transfers" |
| **Deployment instance** | One dedicated SG/Send deployment (Lambda, Container, Server) | "Organisations will pay for dedicated instances on their infrastructure" |
| **API call** | One programmatic transfer via API/CLI/MCP | "Developers and LLM agents will pay per API-initiated transfer" |

**Accountant implication:** Do NOT produce revenue projections based on market-size extrapolation. Instead, define the billable units, set hypothesis prices, and plan to discover the actual willingness-to-pay through early customers.

### 2.3 No Made-Up Projections

**Source:** `docs/business-plan/cbr-business-plan.v0.9.md` (revenue model section); `docs/strategy/serverless-financial-model-and-growth-strategy.md` (development discipline)

CBR's business plan is explicit: revenue projections are based on engagement metrics and hypothesis testing, not invented numbers. The plan says things like:
- "Revenue model validated through engagement, not speculation"
- "We discover pricing through usage patterns"
- "Conservative exit multiple: 3-5x"

**What this means for SG/Send financial materials:**

| Do | Don't |
|---|---|
| State the billable units and hypothesis prices | Produce a 5-year revenue forecast with specific numbers |
| Show the cost structure (Lambda, S3, CloudFront per unit) | Claim "if we capture 1% of the $7B market..." |
| Present deployment cost models at different scales | Project customer numbers without evidence |
| Reference the one investor group that has validated direction | Extrapolate from one data point to a trend line |
| Show the serverless cost advantage vs competitors | Claim margins without actual pricing data |

**Accountant implication:** The Accountant's first financial document should be a **cost model**, not a revenue forecast. Show what things cost to run. Show how costs scale. Let pricing emerge from that foundation.

### 2.4 Investment Allocation: 60/20/20

**Source:** `docs/strategy/serverless-financial-model-and-growth-strategy.md`

CBR allocates investment funds:
- **60% strategic projects** -- core product development
- **20% market discovery** -- testing pricing hypotheses, customer conversations
- **20% content creation** -- documentation, thought leadership, community

This allocation reflects the serverless philosophy: most investment goes to building value, not to sales teams or marketing campaigns.

**SG/Send adaptation (proposed):**

| Category | % | SG/Send Application |
|---|---|---|
| Strategic projects | 60% | PKI production hardening, key discovery implementation, enterprise deployment packaging |
| Market discovery | 20% | Investor deployment pilot, pricing hypothesis testing, vertical-specific trials (legal, accounting) |
| Content creation | 20% | Documentation, security thought leadership, agentic team story, investor materials |

### 2.5 Near-Zero Foundation Costs

**Source:** `docs/strategy/investment-strategy-analysis.md` (~5/month foundation costs)

CBR claims ~5/month in foundation costs. SG/Send should validate its own number.

**Accountant task:** Calculate SG/Send's actual monthly foundation cost:
- Lambda invocations at idle
- S3 storage for empty system
- CloudFront distribution
- Route 53 DNS
- Any other fixed costs

This number becomes a powerful investor data point: "SG/Send costs £X/month with zero users. Every pound above that is directly tied to value delivery."

## 3. Financial Frameworks to Adopt

### 3.1 Billable Units Framework

**Source:** `docs/strategy/serverless-financial-model-and-growth-strategy.md`

Every feature maps to a billable unit. The framework:

```
Feature → Billable Unit → Hypothesis Price → Cost to Deliver → Margin Hypothesis
```

**SG/Send example:**
```
PKI Transfer → PKI key exchange → £0.50/exchange (hypothesis) → £0.003 compute (Lambda + S3) → 99.4% margin hypothesis
```

The Accountant should produce a complete billable units table for SG/Send's current feature set.

### 3.2 Cost-Per-Unit Model

**Source:** `docs/strategy/revenue-model-and-financial-strategy.md` (Appendix J: Billable Units)

CBR defines cost-per-unit for each service tier. SG/Send should do the same:

| Unit | Lambda Cost | S3 Cost | CloudFront Cost | Total Unit Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| File upload (10MB) | ~£0.0001 | ~£0.0002 | -- | ~£0.0003 | Encryption happens client-side (zero compute) |
| File storage (10MB/day) | -- | ~£0.0002 | -- | ~£0.0002 | S3 standard storage |
| File download (10MB) | ~£0.0001 | ~£0.0001 | ~£0.001 | ~£0.0012 | CloudFront transfer |
| PKI key exchange | ~£0.0002 | ~£0.0001 | -- | ~£0.0003 | Key registry lookup + storage |

**Note:** These are rough estimates. The Accountant's first task should be to produce accurate unit costs from actual AWS billing data.

### 3.3 Scale Projection Model

**Source:** `docs/strategy/serverless-financial-model-and-growth-strategy.md` (deployment costs at scale)

CBR projects costs at different user scales. SG/Send should produce the same:

| Scale | Monthly Transfers | Storage | Estimated Monthly Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Idle | 0 | 0 | £? (measure) | Foundation cost |
| 100 users | ~500 | 5 GB | £? (calculate) | Early adoption |
| 1,000 users | ~5,000 | 50 GB | £? (calculate) | Growth phase |
| 10,000 users | ~50,000 | 500 GB | £? (calculate) | Scale phase |

### 3.4 Deployment Cost Comparison

**Source:** `docs/strategy/runs-everywhere-strategy.md`

SG/Send's 7 deployment targets have different cost profiles:

| Deployment Target | Fixed Cost | Variable Cost | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lambda (current) | Near-zero | Per-invocation | SaaS, low-to-medium volume |
| Docker/Fargate | Container hours | Per-container | Predictable workloads |
| EC2/AMI | Instance hours | Fixed per instance | High-volume, air-gapped |
| CLI | Zero (user's machine) | Zero | Developer/API usage |

The Accountant should produce a detailed cost model for each deployment target. This becomes a powerful investor tool: "Here's what it costs to run SG/Send at 1,000 users on each deployment option."

## 4. What NOT to Do (Learned from CBR)

The CBR materials are notable for what they **avoid**:

1. **No hockey-stick revenue graphs.** Revenue projections exist (in the narrative pitch deck) but are conservative and clearly labelled as targets, not forecasts.
2. **No "if we capture X% of the market" logic.** Market sizing is presented as context, not as a revenue derivation.
3. **No vanity metrics.** CBR reports "300 registered accounts" honestly -- not "300 registered accounts with 50% week-over-week growth."
4. **No burn rate anxiety.** The serverless model makes burn rate nearly irrelevant. The narrative is about capital efficiency, not runway.
5. **No premature pricing.** CBR explicitly states it will discover pricing through usage. The business plan says "revenue model validated through engagement, not speculation."

## 5. Accountant's Proposed First Deliverables

Based on this review, the Accountant should produce:

| # | Deliverable | Source Framework | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **SG/Send cost model** -- actual AWS costs per unit (transfer, storage, download, PKI) | CBR billable units framework | **P1** |
| 2 | **Foundation cost measurement** -- monthly cost with zero users | CBR ~5/month benchmark | **P1** |
| 3 | **Scale projection table** -- costs at 100, 1K, 10K users | CBR scale projection model | **P1** |
| 4 | **Billable units definition** -- complete mapping of features to billable units | CBR billable units framework | **P1** |
| 5 | **Deployment cost comparison** -- per-target cost model | CBR runs-everywhere + SG/Send 7 targets | **P2** |
| 6 | **Investment allocation proposal** -- 60/20/20 adapted for SG/Send | CBR serverless financial model | **P2** |
| 7 | **Pricing hypothesis document** -- hypothesis prices for each billable unit (NOT forecasts) | CBR hypothesis-driven development | **P2** |

---

## 6. Key Insight for Investors

The CBR financial philosophy gives the Accountant a clear message for investors:

> "We don't make up revenue projections. We know exactly what each transfer costs us to deliver (fractions of a penny). We know our foundation cost is near-zero. We know our architecture scales linearly. What we're discovering is what customers will pay -- and we have the capital efficiency to discover it without running out of money."

This is more credible than any 5-year forecast. It shows financial discipline, architectural understanding, and intellectual honesty -- three things investors in deep-tech rarely see together.

## 7. Relationship to CBR Financial Data

For reference, CBR's financial parameters. **Note:** The live website at `investor.myfeeds.ai` shows updated parameters (marked with *) that differ from the git repository:

| Parameter | CBR (Git Repo) | CBR (Live Website*) | **SG/Send (Confirmed)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Seed ask | £250K | €300K* | **£300K** |
| Equity offered | 20% | 20% | **20%** |
| Post-money valuation | £1.25M | €1.5M* | **£1.5M** |
| Foundation cost | ~£5/month | ~€5/month | ? (measure) |
| Target exit multiple | 3-5x (conservative), 8x (optimistic) | Not stated on site | ? |
| Exit timeline | 2-3 years | Not stated on site | ? |
| SEIS/EIS eligible | Yes (UK structure) | Portugal-based, EU-compliant* | **Yes — UK-based, SEIS/EIS applies** |
| Investor structure | 5-6 angels at £50K each | Not specified | ? (adopt CBR model: 6 angels at £50K) |
| Hiring model | Not specified | No permanent hires, contractors only* | **Agentic team (19 AI agents) + specialist contractors** |
| Revenue target | Conservative | €500k+ ARR* | ? |
| Customer target | Not specified | 5-10 pilot customers* | ? |
| Use of funds | 60/20/20 | 70/10/10/10* | ? (adopt 70/10/10/10 or adapt) |

**Decisions confirmed (21 Feb 2026):**
1. **SG/Send is UK-based.** SEIS/EIS qualification retained — this is a significant investor incentive (up to 50% tax relief for SEIS, 30% for EIS)
2. **Currency is GBP (£).** SG/Send operates in £, not € like CBR's current website
3. **Ask is £300K for 20% at £1.5M post-money.** Same structure as CBR, same equity percentage, GBP-denominated

**Key CBR changes from git repo to live website (for reference):**
1. **Currency shift:** £ → € (reflects Portugal HQ — does not apply to SG/Send)
2. **Higher ask:** €300K vs £250K (SG/Send adopts the higher amount: £300K)
3. **Explicit "profitable by design" claim:** Each user generates positive margin from day one (applies to SG/Send — same serverless model)
4. **Evolved allocation:** From 60/20/20 to 70/10/10/10 — more product-focused (SG/Send to determine its own allocation)
5. **Explicit lean model:** No permanent hires, contractors only — validates SG/Send's agentic approach

**Accountant next step:** With investment parameters confirmed (£300K/20%/£1.5M, UK, SEIS/EIS), the Accountant can now model: (1) SEIS/EIS investor returns at different exit multiples, (2) use-of-funds allocation proposal for SG/Send, (3) foundation cost measurement to validate "profitable by design" claim.
