## 1. What the Website Shows

The investor.myfeeds.ai site is a **live investor portal** -- a polished, web-based presentation layer built on top of the raw strategy documents in the git repo. It demonstrates several concepts that go beyond what the git repo alone conveys.

### Key Observations

**1. "Eat Your Own Dog Food" -- The Product IS the Pitch**

The most striking thing about investor.myfeeds.ai is that it IS a MyFeeds.ai product. The investor portal is built using the same personalised news feed architecture described in `personalised-news-feed-architecture.md`. The investor isn't just reading about the product -- they're experiencing it. The site delivers personalised, curated cybersecurity intelligence content as proof that the content delivery engine works.

This is a powerful pattern: **the investor experience IS the product demo.**

**2. Content-Driven Investor Engagement**

The site is structured around actual cybersecurity content -- curated feeds, news articles, analysis pieces -- not just pitch slides and financial projections. This demonstrates the "content generation engine" described in the marketing strategy doc. Investors can see real, fresh, relevant cybersecurity content being processed and delivered through the platform.

**3. The MyFeeds.ai Branding**

The site uses "MyFeeds.ai" as the consumer-facing brand (investor.myfeeds.ai), while "The Cyber Boardroom" appears as the corporate/technology brand. This dual-branding approach separates the product identity from the company identity -- a pattern worth noting for SG/Send (send.sgraph.ai vs SGraph AI as the parent).

**4. Real-Time Content Delivery**

The page shows actual personalised feeds with current cybersecurity news, demonstrating that the content pipeline (RSS collection -> transformation -> knowledge graph -> personalisation -> delivery) is operational, not theoretical. This is traction evidence beyond what the git repo documents convey.

**5. Multi-Section Investor Narrative Flow**

The page flows through a structured narrative:
- What is the opportunity?
- How does the technology work?
- What is the content strategy?
- What is the market?
- Why this team?

This is a web-based version of the narrative pitch deck, but interactive and backed by live data.

## 2. What This Means for SG/Send

### Pattern to Adopt: "Investor Portal as Product Demo"

The single most valuable concept from investor.myfeeds.ai is: **make the investor experience the product.**

For SG/Send, this translates to:

> **Send the investor briefing pack via SG/Send itself.**
>
> The investor's first interaction with SG/Send should be receiving the pitch materials through an encrypted SG/Send transfer. They experience zero-knowledge encryption, the download workflow, the UI quality, and the security model -- all before reading a single word of the pitch.

This was identified in the Alchemist's review as transmutation principle #6 ("Investor as user"), but the investor.myfeeds.ai site proves it works in practice. CBR has actually built this. It's not theoretical.

### Pattern to Adopt: "Content as Traction"

investor.myfeeds.ai shows live, fresh content flowing through the platform. SG/Send's equivalent would be:

- Show actual transfers happening on the platform (anonymised metrics)
- Show the PKI key exchange working in real-time
- Show deployment status across multiple targets

A "status.sgraph.ai" or equivalent page that shows the system is alive, secure, and operational would serve the same purpose as MyFeeds.ai's live content feeds.

### Pattern to Adopt: "Dual Branding"

MyFeeds.ai (product) vs The Cyber Boardroom (company). SG/Send already has this:
- **send.sgraph.ai** -- product brand (user-facing)
- **SGraph AI** -- parent company/technology brand (investor-facing)

The investor materials should reference both, with send.sgraph.ai as the product and SGraph AI as the technology platform.

### Pattern to Adopt: "Web-Based Investor Materials"

investor.myfeeds.ai is a website, not a PDF. This is deliberate -- it allows:
- Real-time content updates (no stale pitch decks)
- Interactive elements (live feeds, demos)
- Analytics (who visits, what they read, how long they stay)
- Link sharing (one URL instead of email attachments)

SG/Send should consider whether an **investor.sgraph.ai** or equivalent web presence is worth building. However, there's a stronger move available: **the SG/Send investor portal should itself be an encrypted SG/Send share** -- demonstrating the product while delivering the pitch.

## 3. Additional Ideas Surfaced by the Website

| # | Idea | From Website | SG/Send Application |
|---|------|-------------|---------------------|
| 21 | **Investor portal as product demo** | investor.myfeeds.ai IS a MyFeeds product | Send investor materials via SG/Send. The pitch IS the demo. |
| 22 | **Live traction evidence in investor materials** | Real-time cybersecurity feeds on investor page | Show live transfer metrics, PKI exchanges, system health |
| 23 | **Dual branding (product vs company)** | MyFeeds.ai vs The Cyber Boardroom | send.sgraph.ai vs SGraph AI |
| 24 | **Web-native investor materials** | Website > PDF pitch deck | Consider investor.sgraph.ai or encrypted SG/Send share for materials |
| 25 | **Content pipeline as credibility proof** | Live content shows the engine works | Live system metrics show the encryption/transfer pipeline works |

These are ideas #21-25, continuing from the 20 identified in the original debrief.

## 4. Updated Transfer Value Assessment

The investor.myfeeds.ai website **upgrades** several items from the original review:

| Original Rating | Updated Rating | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Investor user journey (doc 7): MEDIUM | **HIGH** | The website proves "investor as user" works in practice, not just theory |
| Marketing strategy (doc 9): HIGH | **CRITICAL** | The zero-budget model includes building the product as the marketing vehicle -- investor.myfeeds.ai IS the marketing |
| Minerva prompt (doc 22): MEDIUM | **HIGH** | If the investor portal includes AI-assisted Q&A (likely, given the Athena/Minerva personas), this is a proven pattern |

## 5. The Strongest New Idea

**"Send the pitch deck through SG/Send."**

This is the single most powerful takeaway from reviewing investor.myfeeds.ai:

- CBR makes investors *use* the product to learn about the investment
- SG/Send should do the same -- but SG/Send's version is even stronger
- When an investor opens their first SG/Send transfer, they see: encrypted download, zero-knowledge verification, clean UI, fast transfer
- Before they read a single slide, they've already validated the core product experience
- Every investor becomes a product tester. Every pitch becomes a demo.

The B1 investor group already identified NDA/term-sheet sharing as a use case. This closes the loop: the investor materials themselves are the first transfer.

## 6. "The Ask" — Updated CBR Investment Parameters

A final section of investor.myfeeds.ai reveals the current investment terms. These differ significantly from the git repository documents and represent the **live, current parameters**:

### Current Investment Terms (from investor.myfeeds.ai)

| Parameter | Git Repo (older) | Website (current) | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Investment ask** | £250,000 | **€300,000** | Currency changed (£→€), amount increased |
| **Equity offered** | 20% | **20%** | Unchanged |
| **Post-money valuation** | £1.25M | **€1.5M** | Currency changed, valuation increased |
| **HQ location** | UK (implied) | **Portugal-based, EU-compliant** | Geographic shift |
| **Use of funds** | 60/20/20 (strategic/discovery/content) | **70/10/10/10** (see below) | More product-focused |
| **Hiring model** | Not specified | **No permanent hires, contractors only** | Explicit lean model |
| **Revenue target** | Not specified | **€500k+ ARR** | Explicit target |
| **Customer target** | Not specified | **5-10 pilot customers** | Explicit target |

### Use of Funds Breakdown (Current)

| Allocation | % | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Product experiments | **70%** | Core product development and feature testing |
| Marketing tests | **10%** | Measurable ROI-driven marketing experiments |
| Content partnerships | **10%** | Pay-for-performance only |
| Admin & compliance | **10%** | Operations, legal, EU compliance |

### Key Phrase: "Profitable by Design"

The website uses the phrase **"Profitable by design — each user generates positive margin from day one."** This is a stronger claim than the git repo's "no kill date" language. It combines:
- The serverless cost model (near-zero idle costs)
- The hypothesis-driven development approach (every feature creates a billable unit)
- The contractors-only hiring model (no permanent salary overhead)

### Implications for SG/Send (Alchemist Priority)

1. **Currency and geography shift:** CBR is now explicitly Portugal-based and Euro-denominated. **SG/Send decision (21 Feb): UK-based, GBP-denominated. SEIS/EIS applies.** SG/Send's ask: **£300K for 20% at £1.5M post-money.**

2. **70/10/10/10 vs 60/20/20:** CBR has shifted to an even more product-heavy allocation. The 70% product experiments allocation validates the hypothesis-driven approach — most capital goes to building and testing, not marketing or sales.

3. **"Profitable by design" as transmutable concept:** This is stronger than "no kill date." SG/Send should adopt this language: *"Each encrypted transfer generates positive margin. The serverless architecture means every user is profitable from their first transfer."*

4. **"No permanent hires, contractors only":** This directly parallels SG/Send's agentic team model. The transmutation: *"We don't hire permanent staff — we have 19 AI agents and engage specialist contractors when human expertise is needed."*

5. **€500k+ ARR target with 5-10 pilots:** This provides a concrete framework. SG/Send should define its own pilot-to-ARR pathway with specific targets.

6. **"Specific growth experiments without increasing burn rate":** Each project has clear success metrics. No open-ended investment in growth — every spend is a hypothesis with a measurable outcome.

*Addendum complete. 5 additional ideas identified (#21-25), plus updated financial parameters from investor.myfeeds.ai. Core insight: the investor experience should BE the product demo. The current CBR investment ask is €300K for 20% at €1.5M post-money, Portugal-based, with a "profitable by design" philosophy.*
