# Librarian Review: CBR Investment Repository Catalogue

**Version:** v0.5.8
**Date:** 21 February 2026
**Role:** Librarian (Town Planner team)
**Source:** `https://github.com/the-cyber-boardroom/cbr-investment.git`
**Type:** Source materials catalogue and cross-project knowledge transfer assessment

## 1. Repository Overview

The `cbr-investment` repository is the investment and business strategy documentation suite for **The Cyber Boardroom (CBR)** -- a separate startup by the same founder (Dinis Cruz). It contains 26 documents across 4 categories, totalling approximately 80,000 words of investment-grade content.

**Key fact:** CBR and SG/Send share the same founder, the same technology stack (OSBot Utils, Type_Safe, FastAPI, serverless Lambda), the same open-source licence (Apache 2.0), and the same strategic philosophy (Wardley Maps, "runs everywhere," LLMs as commodity). This makes the CBR investment materials a highly relevant knowledge base for SG/Send's own Town Planner team.

3. **Use investment strategy analysis** as template for SG/Send's own investment structure
4. **Index these documents in the Alchemist's materials library** as cross-project reference materials
5. **Do NOT duplicate content** -- reference by URL where appropriate, transmute where SG/Send-specific content is needed
