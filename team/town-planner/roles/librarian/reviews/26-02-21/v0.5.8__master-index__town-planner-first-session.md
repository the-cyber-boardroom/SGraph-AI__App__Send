## 1. Source Materials Catalogue

### 1.1 Investor-Facing Materials (for-ambassador/)

These documents were authored by the human (Dinis Cruz) and placed in `for-ambassador/` explicitly for external-facing use. They are the Alchemist's primary raw material for transmutation.

| # | Document | Version | Date | Audience | Currency | Path |
|---|----------|---------|------|----------|----------|------|
| 1 | [SG/Send for Investors: What Works Today](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/17/for-ambassador/v0.4.4__ambassador__sg-send-for-investors-today.md) | v0.4.4 | 16 Feb | Investment companies | **STALE** — pre-PKI | `briefs/02/17/for-ambassador/` |
| 2 | [SG/Send for Investors: Coming Soon](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/17/for-ambassador/v0.4.4__ambassador__sg-send-for-investors-coming-soon.md) | v0.4.4 | 16 Feb | Investment companies | **STALE** — PKI now built, not "coming soon" | `briefs/02/17/for-ambassador/` |
| 3 | [SG/Send for Investors: Future Vision](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/17/for-ambassador/v0.4.4__ambassador__sg-send-for-investors-future-vision.md) | v0.4.4 | 16 Feb | Investment companies | **CURRENT** — long-term vision still valid | `briefs/02/17/for-ambassador/` |
| 4 | [SG/Send for Accountants](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/17/for-ambassador/v0.4.7__ambassador__sg-send-for-accountants.md) | v0.4.7 | 17 Feb | Accounting firms, SMEs | **CURRENT** — vertical pitch, still valid | `briefs/02/17/for-ambassador/` |
| 5 | [Agentic Team Setup and Workflows](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/17/for-ambassador/v0.4.7__briefing__agentic-team-setup-and-workflows.md) | v0.4.7 | 17 Feb | General / technical | **STALE** — describes 2 teams, now 3 | `briefs/02/17/for-ambassador/` |

**Currency assessment summary:** 3 of 5 documents are stale. The investor materials (docs 1-2) need urgent updating to reflect the PKI milestone and the expanded three-team structure. The agentic team briefing (doc 5) needs updating to include the Town Planner team. **Branding note:** written materials use "SG/Send"; "SigSend" is the spoken/verbal form only (human decision 21 Feb).

## 3. Alchemist Materials Library Status

The materials library was scaffolded during Town Planner team setup. Current state:

```
library/alchemist/
  narratives/         .gitkeep only (EMPTY)
  materials/          .gitkeep only (EMPTY)
  investors/          .gitkeep only (EMPTY)
  due-diligence/
    technical/        .gitkeep only (EMPTY)
    business/         .gitkeep only (EMPTY)
    legal/            .gitkeep only (EMPTY)
```

**Assessment:** The directory structure is correct and matches the role definition. All folders are empty. This is expected for the first session -- the Alchemist's Workstream-1 (materials inventory and audit) must complete before materials begin to populate these folders.

## 5. Cross-Team Dependencies

### What the Alchemist Needs from Explorer

| Need | Source Role | Status | Urgency |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|
| PKI architecture in investor-readable form | Architect | **Available** — docs 26-29 need translation | HIGH |
| Working PKI demo for investor meetings | Developer | **Available** — pki.html + pki-manager.js deployed | HIGH |
| Security posture summary | AppSec | **Available** — 25 PKI findings (docs 30-33) | HIGH |
| User feedback / traction quotes | Sherpa | **Partial** — "Signal for the web" tube quote, security reviewer quotes | MEDIUM |
| Updated architecture diagrams for non-technical audiences | Architect + Designer | **Not started** | MEDIUM |
| Post-quantum cryptography position paper | Architect | **Not started** | LOW |

### What the Alchemist Needs from Villager

| Need | Source Role | Status | Urgency |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Production readiness confirmation for investor demos | DevOps | **Not started** — deployment packaging still open | HIGH |
| Financial model / cost data | Accountant | **UNBLOCKED** — Accountant role created 21 Feb | HIGH |
| Performance benchmarks | QA + DevOps | **Not started** | MEDIUM |
| Deployment capability evidence (one-click deploy) | DevOps | **Not started** — templates in progress | MEDIUM |

### What the Alchemist Needs from Town Planner Team (Internal)

| Need | Source Role | Status | Urgency |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|
| B0-B10 framework formalised | GRC | **Defined conceptually** in doc 7, not yet a formal framework | MEDIUM |
| D0-D10 framework formalised | GRC | **Not started** | LOW |
| Wardley Maps for investment story | Cartographer | **Partially available** — Wardley Maps brief exists | MEDIUM |

## 6. Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps (Block Investor Readiness)

| # | Gap | Impact | Recommended Action |
|---|-----|--------|-------------------|
| G-1 | **No updated investor briefing pack since PKI milestone** | Investor follow-up meeting will use stale materials | Alchemist Task-3: produce updated pack incorporating PKI, security review |
| G-2 | ~~**Accountant role does not exist**~~ **RESOLVED** | Accountant role created in Town Planner team (21 Feb) | `team/town-planner/roles/accountant/ROLE.md` |
| G-3 | **No investor pipeline tracking** | B1 relationship managed ad hoc | Alchemist Task-11: create pipeline.issues |
| G-4 | **No demo script for PKI** | PKI demo exists but is unscripted -- risk of poor investor impression | Alchemist Task-14: create demo script |

### High-Priority Gaps

| # | Gap | Impact | Recommended Action |
|---|-----|--------|-------------------|
| G-5 | **for-ambassador/ materials 60% stale** | External-facing docs misrepresent current capabilities | Alchemist Tasks 3-5: update or replace stale materials |
| G-6 | **No narratives written** | Investor story not codified or version-controlled | Alchemist Workstream-2: write all 5 narratives |
| G-7 | **No due diligence readiness documents** | If investor due diligence starts, nothing is indexed | Alchemist Tasks 15-18: populate due-diligence/ |
| G-8 | **Agentic team briefing outdated** | Describes 2 teams; now 3 teams with Town Planner | Alchemist Task-5: update agentic story |

### Medium-Priority Gaps

| # | Gap | Impact | Recommended Action |
|---|-----|--------|-------------------|
| G-9 | No investor-readable architecture diagrams | Technical docs are for technologists, not investors | Request Architect + Designer collaboration |
| G-10 | No formal B0-B10 framework document | Business priority classification exists conceptually but is not a standalone reference | GRC to produce framework document |
| G-11 | No one-pager executive summary | Missing the "give me two minutes" document | Alchemist Task-21 (depends on narratives) |
| G-12 | Operational runbooks still unwritten | Investor due diligence would expose operational immaturity | GRC P1 from Villager backlog |

## 7. Document Health

### Coverage

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Investor-facing materials catalogued | 10 | Complete |
| Strategic/business documents catalogued | 5 | Complete |
| Journalist articles (traction evidence) | 8 | Complete |
| Historian milestones | 2 | Complete |
| Technical source documents (PKI, security, architecture) | 15 | Complete |
| Incident reports catalogued | 4 | Complete |
| Total documents in Alchemist source catalogue | **44** | Complete |
| Alchemist materials library folders | 6 | All empty (expected) |
| Alchemist workstream tasks | 21 | All at `todo` (expected) |

### Key Flags

1. **PKI milestone is the Alchemist's biggest asset** -- investor-validated, technically demonstrated, independently reviewed. This is the centrepiece of the updated investor narrative.
2. **60% of for-ambassador/ materials are stale** -- pre-PKI, pre-three-team. Updating these is the highest-leverage first action.
3. **The "gold is real" principle is well-supported** -- 44 source documents provide provenance for every investor claim. No fabrication needed.
4. **Accountant role created** -- the Alchemist's dependency on financial models is now unblocked. The Accountant role was created in the Town Planner team on 21 Feb (`team/town-planner/roles/accountant/ROLE.md`).
5. **Incident response is a selling point** -- 100-minute hotfix, data breach contained in 30 minutes, 29 security findings from external review. These are ahead-of-curve for a pre-Series A company.
