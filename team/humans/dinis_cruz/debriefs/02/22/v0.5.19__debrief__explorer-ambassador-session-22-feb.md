## Deliverables (Recommended Reading Order)

### 1. Session Activation

- **File:** [v0.5.19__activation__explorer-session-22-feb.md](../../../roles/ambassador/reviews/26-02-22/v0.5.19__activation__explorer-session-22-feb.md)
- **What:** Context assessment, priority table, strategic assessment of product evolution
- **Key output:** Updated 10-second pitch: "SG/Send: secure data rooms your team owns. Zero-knowledge encryption. Costs nothing when idle."

### 2. SSH Key Utility — SEO & Competitive Research

- **File:** [v0.5.19__research__ssh-key-utility-seo-and-competition.md](../../../roles/ambassador/reviews/26-02-22/v0.5.19__research__ssh-key-utility-seo-and-competition.md)
- **What:** Mapped 9 competitors, identified target query clusters, defined differentiation strategy
- **Key finding:** No dominant player. Trust is the biggest gap — no existing tool is both open source AND from a security brand. "ssh key generator online" is medium competition with clear room for a quality entrant. Education (step-by-step GitHub/server instructions) is underserved.

### 3. First Marketing Campaign — Measurement Framework

- **File:** [v0.5.19__framework__first-campaign-measurement.md](../../../roles/ambassador/reviews/26-02-22/v0.5.19__framework__first-campaign-measurement.md)
- **What:** Complete metrics architecture respecting zero user tracking. Four tiers: Reach, Engagement, Conversion, Amplification.
- **Key output:** 30-day targets (100+ page views, 10+ CTA clicks, top-50 ranking for one query) and 90-day targets. Anonymous analytics implementation plan using server-side counters.
- **Decision needed:** DPO review of the anonymous analytics approach before implementation.

### 4. Data Room — Investor Positioning Copy

- **File:** [v0.5.19__positioning__data-room-investor-copy.md](../../../roles/ambassador/reviews/26-02-22/v0.5.19__positioning__data-room-investor-copy.md)
- **What:** Ready-to-use pitch copy for both investor groups. Competitive differentiation matrix against legacy VDRs (Intralinks, Datasite) and modern VDRs (Digify, iDeals). Objection handling guide. Validated proof points.
- **Key output:** SG/Send sits below budget VDR tier on price (£49-999/month vs £140-25,000+/month) while exceeding enterprise tier on security. Positioning: "enterprise security at startup pricing."

### 5. Team Site — Content Strategy

- **File:** [v0.5.19__strategy__team-site-content.md](../../../roles/ambassador/reviews/26-02-22/v0.5.19__strategy__team-site-content.md)
- **What:** Complete content plan for team.send.sgraph.ai. Agent grid layout (3 tiers), content-per-agent structure (static context + conversation + featured examples), content calendar (3 phases), shareable links strategy, SEO plan.
- **Key output:** Tier 1 hero agents: Architect, AppSec, Ambassador, Developer. Three audiences: potential customers, open-source contributors, the human.

## Key Decisions Made

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Updated 10-second pitch to focus on data rooms, not just file transfer | Product has evolved to a platform. The data room is what customers buy. |
| 2 | SSH key utility remains B3/D3 | Must not block investor demo work (B1/D1). Pipeline building, not revenue. |
| 3 | Anonymous analytics only (no cookies, no tracking) | Consistent with zero-knowledge brand. DPO review needed before implementation. |
| 4 | Tier 1 agents for team site: Architect, AppSec, Ambassador, Developer | These cover the three audiences: customers (Ambassador, AppSec), technical evaluators (Architect), and contributors (Developer). |

## What's Next

| Priority | Item | Owner | Depends On |
|----------|------|-------|-----------|
| **A1** | Prepare branded data room for Investor Group 2 | Dev + DevOps | Data room architecture (Architect) |
