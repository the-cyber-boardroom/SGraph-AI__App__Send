# Debrief: SSH Key Utility — Architect, Dev, and Designer Guidance

**version** v0.5.19
**date** 22 Feb 2026
**role** Architect, Developer, Designer (Explorer team)
**type** Session debrief

---

## Executive Summary

Three roles produced guidance documents for building the SSH key generator utility. The Architect defined the deployment architecture, crypto strategy, and security model. The Developer produced a detailed implementation plan with code patterns and testing strategy. The Designer created UX wireframes and visual design guidance. The utility is ready to build.

**Key decisions made in this session:**

1. **Web Crypto API, no external libraries** — zero-dependency principle. Ed25519 via `crypto.subtle`, with feature detection for older browsers.
2. **IFD versioned path under `tools/ssh-keygen/`** — separates utilities from the core send/download workflow.
3. **`connect-src 'none'` CSP** — browser-enforced guarantee that keys never leave the page. Strongest trust signal possible.
4. **Single Web Component** (`<ssh-keygen-app>`) — follows existing codebase pattern. One component owns the full UI lifecycle.
5. **Segmented control** for algorithm selection (not radio buttons) — cleaner, more touch-friendly.

**Estimated effort:** 1-2 sessions. The OpenSSH format conversion (PKCS8 DER → OpenSSH PEM) is the only technically challenging part.

## Deliverables (Recommended Reading Order)

### 1. Architect — Architecture Guidance

- **File:** [v0.5.19__guidance__ssh-key-utility-architecture.md](../../../../../roles/architect/reviews/26-02-22/v0.5.19__guidance__ssh-key-utility-architecture.md)
- **Key content:** Deployment topology (two Lambda mount points, one codebase), crypto strategy (Web Crypto with Ed25519 feature detection), OpenSSH format specification (wire format details for public and private keys), CSP security model, URL structure for SEO.

### 2. Developer — Implementation Plan

- **File:** [v0.5.19__implementation-plan__ssh-key-utility.md](../../../../../roles/dev/reviews/26-02-22/v0.5.19__implementation-plan__ssh-key-utility.md)
- **Key content:** Complete file structure, API surface for `ssh-crypto.js` (key generation + format conversion), Web Component structure (`ssh-keygen-app.js`), `index.html` page shell with JSON-LD structured data, redirect route for SEO canonical URL, 7-step implementation order, 11 browser acceptance tests, validation script.

### 3. Designer — UX/Design Guidance

- **File:** [v0.5.19__guidance__ssh-key-utility-ux-design.md](../../../../../roles/designer/reviews/26-02-22/v0.5.19__guidance__ssh-key-utility-ux-design.md)
- **Key content:** Full desktop and mobile wireframes, component design (segmented control, key display areas, copy feedback, accordion how-to cards), animation spec, accessibility requirements (WCAG AA), competitive comparison showing design gaps we can exploit.

## Key Decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Web Crypto API only (no tweetnacl, no sshpk) | Zero-dependency principle. Brand alignment ("powered by Web Crypto API"). Hardware-backed RNG. |
| 2 | Ed25519 default, RSA 4096 fallback, ECDSA optional | Ed25519 is modern best practice. RSA for older systems. ECDSA included per brief. |
| 3 | `connect-src 'none'` CSP | Browser-enforced zero-network. Strongest possible trust signal — not a promise, an enforcement. |
| 4 | Tools namespace (`/tools/ssh-keygen/`) | Separates utilities from core workflow. Extensible for future tools (password generator, cert inspector). |
| 5 | Segmented control (not radio buttons) | Better touch UX, cleaner visual in Aurora dark theme. |
| 6 | Accordion how-to cards (collapsed by default) | Keeps page scannable. 4 cards: GitHub, GitLab, Server, AWS EC2. |
| 7 | No passphrase support in v0.1.0 | Brief doesn't require it. Can be added in v0.1.1 if needed. |

---

## Open Questions (For Human)

| # | Question | Context |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | Passphrase-protected keys in v0.1.0? | Brief says no. Architect flagged as open question. Confirm. |
| 2 | ECDSA P-256 — include or defer? | Brief includes it. Architect notes ECDSA SSH keys are uncommon. Worth the effort? |
| 3 | Fingerprint display — include? | Not in brief. Both Architect and Designer recommend it. Adds trust. |
| 4 | Admin Lambda deployment — symlink or copy? | DevOps question. Symlink is cleaner but may not work in Lambda ZIP packaging. |

## What's Next

| Priority | Item | Owner | Blocked By |
|----------|------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Build `ssh-crypto.js` (Ed25519 + RSA generation and OpenSSH format) | Dev | Nothing — can start immediately |
| 2 | Build `ssh-keygen-app.js` (Web Component) | Dev | Step 1 |
| 3 | Build page shell + CSS + structured data | Dev | Step 2 |
| 4 | Ambassador writes how-to copy (GitHub, GitLab, AWS, server) | Ambassador | Nothing — can start in parallel |
| 5 | AppSec reviews crypto implementation | AppSec | Step 1 complete |
| 6 | Add redirect route to user Lambda | Dev | Step 3 |
| 7 | Deploy to both Lambdas | DevOps | Step 6 |
