# Debrief: v0.1.3 Session Wrap-Up — 13 Feb 2026

**Version:** v0.2.33
**Date:** 13 February 2026
**Session:** `claude/read-secure-send-brief-Mz6yN`
**Follows:** [Debrief for Brief #1](v0.2.32__debrief__daily-brief-responses-13-feb.md) | [Debrief for Brief #2](v0.2.33__debrief__daily-brief-2-responses-13-feb.md)

## What happened

This session started with two daily briefs and ended with **three shipped UI versions, 4 languages live, a new role activated, and a LinkedIn post celebrating Klingon support**. Here's the full story.

### The arc of the session

1. **Daily Brief #1** landed with first-user feedback and UX priorities
2. **10 role responses** produced — execution plan, architecture, security reviews, test plans
3. **Daily Brief #2** pivoted hard: Google Analytics out, cache service in, zero cookies forever
4. **9 more role responses** produced — cache schema designed, GA removal approved unanimously, IFD enforcement codified
5. **Sherpa activated for the first time** — journey maps, trail observation plan, friction log
6. **Three UI versions shipped** following IFD methodology — each building on the last, all previous versions preserved
7. **Bug fixes and polish** — auto-decrypt, SGMETA metadata, drop zone fix, language selector fix, hash-change fix
8. **LinkedIn post** — you shared the multilingual MVP publicly, featuring the Klingon translation

## Shipped: Three UI Versions (IFD in Practice)

| Version | What shipped | Key files |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **v0.1.1** | Hash-fragment URLs — single-link sharing replaces copy-link-and-key friction. GA removed from all pages. | [send-upload.js](../../../../sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__user/v0/v0.1/v0.1.1/components/send-upload/send-upload.js), [send-download.js](../../../../sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__user/v0/v0.1/v0.1.1/components/send-download/send-download.js) |
| **v0.1.2** | Text input mode — encrypt and send text, not just files. Backend `content_type_hint` in transfer info. Auto-decrypt for hash-fragment URLs. | [send-upload.js](../../../../sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__user/v0/v0.1/v0.1.2/components/send-upload/send-upload.js), [send-download.js](../../../../sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__user/v0/v0.1/v0.1.2/components/send-download/send-download.js) |
| **v0.1.3** | **i18n foundation** — full internationalisation with locale selector. 4 languages: English, Portuguese (Brasil), Portuguese (Portugal), Klingon. 80+ translated strings. Event-driven component re-rendering on language change. | [i18n.js](../../../../sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__user/v0/v0.1/v0.1.3/js/i18n.js), [en.json](../../../../sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__user/v0/v0.1/v0.1.3/i18n/en.json), [pt.json](../../../../sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__user/v0/v0.1/v0.1.3/i18n/pt.json), [pt-PT.json](../../../../sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__user/v0/v0.1/v0.1.3/i18n/pt-PT.json), [tlh.json](../../../../sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__user/v0/v0.1/v0.1.3/i18n/tlh.json) |

**IFD compliance:** All three versions exist side by side. v0.1.0 (the original) is untouched. Every version is independently accessible at its own URL path. Rollback is instant — change the pointer.

**Total new code:** 4,573 lines across 22 files (18 UI files, 3 Sherpa docs, 1 debrief).

## Shipped: Bug Fixes and Polish

| Fix | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| **Text 0-byte bug** | Text mode was generating empty files — fixed |
| **Auto-decrypt** | Hash-fragment URLs now auto-decrypt without requiring user action |
| **SGMETA metadata** | Transfers now carry `.sgmeta` metadata for content type detection |
| **Drop zone missing** | File drop zone disappeared in certain states — fixed |
| **Language selector active state** | Visual indicator for currently selected language |
| **Hash-change bug on download page** | Navigation between transfers via hash changes now works correctly |
| **Open in new tab link** | Download page now has "open in new tab" for shared links |

---

## Activated: Sherpa Role (First Time)

The Sherpa — responsible for user journey observation, friction detection, and trail-based analytics — produced three foundational documents:

| Document | What it delivers |
|----------|-----------------|
| [First-Time User Journey Map & Friction Log](../../../../roles/sherpa/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__first-time-user-journey-map-and-friction-log.md) | **13 friction points mapped** (3 HIGH, 5 MEDIUM, 5 LOW). Sender flow (7 stages) and recipient flow (4 stages) fully mapped. Friction F002 (split-channel sharing) already partially resolved by v0.1.1 hash-fragment URLs. |
| [Trail Observation Plan](../../../../roles/sherpa/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__trail-observation-plan.md) | **48 telemetry events defined** across sender, recipient, token, and system trails. 6 primary metrics, 6 abandonment metrics. Zero-cookie compliant. Blocked on cache service implementation. |
| [Response to Daily Briefs #1 & #2](../../../../roles/sherpa/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__response-to-daily-briefs__13-feb.md) | Token onboarding trail, domain preference research design, event data UX review, sharing method tracking, no-cookie UX implications, transparency panel content states. |

## LinkedIn Post: The Klingon Moment

You posted publicly on LinkedIn:

> **"Anybody here speaks Klingon? The latest MVP of the SGraph Send service is now available in: English, Portugues (Brasil), Portugues (Portugal), tlhIngan Hol"**

Post URL: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7428147910451638272/

The post includes screenshots showing the product in all 4 languages with the flag-based language selector. This is the first public social media announcement featuring the i18n capability.

**Why this matters for the team:**
- **First public product showcase** of the v0.1.3 UI
- **The Klingon angle** is memorable, shareable, and demonstrates the i18n architecture works for ANY language — including constructed ones
- **The Portuguese variants** (Brasil + Portugal) show the system handles regional dialects, signalling readiness for real international deployment
- **Screenshots show the product** — real UI, not mockups

## Known Bug: Token Gate Page Not Translated

**Reported by:** Dinis Cruz (screenshot)
**Severity:** Medium — visible to every user before they authenticate
**Fix target:** v0.1.4

The token gate page (shown when no valid token is present) has hardcoded English strings that bypass the i18n system. The header and subtitle translate correctly via `app.title` and `app.subtitle`, but the following content stays in English regardless of language selection:

- "Beta Access"
- "Enter your access token to start sending files."
- "Paste your access token" (placeholder)
- "Go" (button)
- "Join the Early Access Program"
- "Sign up to get notified when SGraph Send is available."
- "Name" / "Email" (placeholders)
- "Sign Up" (button)

**Root cause:** These strings are hardcoded in the HTML template and not wired through `I18n.t()`. The `en.json` (and all locale files) have no `gate.*` or `token.*` namespace keys.

**Fix:** Add ~10 new i18n keys (e.g. `gate.title`, `gate.subtitle`, `gate.token_placeholder`, `gate.button`, `gate.signup_title`, `gate.signup_subtitle`, `gate.name_placeholder`, `gate.email_placeholder`, `gate.signup_button`) to all 4 locale files and wire them through `I18n.t()` in the token gate component.

## What's Next

### Immediate (Phase 1 — unblocked)
- DevOps Tier 1 logging (<$1/month)
- Theme system (5 variants, CSS-variable based)
- Landing page explanatory content (Journalist copy ready, needs i18n integration)
- Email sharing (copy text + Gmail link)

### Next Sprint (Phase 2 — cache service)
- Cache service core implementation (Architect schema delivered)
- Server-side analytics (replaces GA)
- Human-friendly token system with usage limits
- Trail observation infrastructure (Sherpa plan ready)

### LinkedIn Follow-Up
- The Klingon post is live and generating visibility
- Journalist and Ambassador should develop follow-up content strategy
- The "zero cookies" story is the next big narrative to tell publicly
