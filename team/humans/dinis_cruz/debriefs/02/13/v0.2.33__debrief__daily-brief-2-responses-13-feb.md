## What happened

You published Daily Brief #2 with the major strategic shift: Google Analytics out, cache service in, no cookies ever. Nine roles reviewed the brief and produced responses. This debrief summarises the output.

**The big shift:** GA removal is unanimously supported. The cache service is approved as the central data backbone. The no-cookie policy gives us a provably stronger privacy posture than any competitor.

## Recommended reading order

### 1. Start here — execution plan

| # | Document | What it covers |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 1 | [Conductor — Updated Execution Plan](../../../../roles/conductor/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__response-to-daily-brief-2__13-feb.md) | 7-phase plan (0-7), cache service as gating item, IFD enforcement as merge gate, role aliasing (Designer→Dev, Advocate→Journalist, etc.), risk register RF-15 through RF-22 |

### 2. Architecture — cache service design (GATING)

| # | Document | What it covers |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 2 | [Architect — Cache Service Schema](../../../../roles/architect/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__response-to-daily-brief-2__13-feb.md) | **THE gating deliverable.** Four schemas (A-D): site analytics, token system, AWS costs, transfer events. Cache ID + Cache Hash resolution. LETS pipeline (on-demand, cascading save). Temporal storage (year/month/day/hour + latest). 8-step implementation sequence for Dev. Decisions D024-D030 proposed. |

### 3. Security + privacy — GA removal + cache hash + localStorage

| # | Document | What it covers |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 3 | [AppSec — Security Assessment](../../../../roles/appsec/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__response-to-daily-brief-2__13-feb.md) | GA removal risk analysis (5 HIGH-severity risks of keeping, 0 HIGH of removing). Cache hash security review — **APPROVED** with SHA-256 + salt. localStorage key caching — **APPROVED** with 7 conditions (opt-in, CSP, SRI, expiry, no filenames). No-cookie attack surface reduction analysis. |
| 4 | [DPO — Formal GA Removal Recommendation](../../../../roles/dpo/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__response-to-daily-brief-2__13-feb.md) | **Formal P0 recommendation to remove GA** (PECR non-compliance, third-party processing eliminated). Draft privacy policy wording for zero-cookie posture and zero-knowledge claims. localStorage key caching assessed as "not personal data SGraph processes." 11 consolidated action items. |

### 4. Implementation + infrastructure

| # | Document | What it covers |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 5 | [Dev — Consolidated Implementation Plan](../../../../roles/dev/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__response-to-daily-brief-2__13-feb.md) | 18 tasks (D-01 through D-18) sized and sequenced across 6 phases. IFD version plan (v0.1.0 through v0.1.9 → v0.2.0 consolidation). Cache service, analytics, token, transparency panel, modular admin UI approaches. ~95-130 hours total estimated. |
| 6 | [DevOps — Pipeline Architecture](../../../../roles/devops/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__response-to-daily-brief-2__13-feb.md) | CloudFront IP masking via post-processing Lambda (not Lambda@Edge). AWS cost collector design. Updated collector pipeline through cache service (not standalone S3). Cost estimate: **~$1.45/month** at beta. 6 DPO coordination points, 7 Architect coordination points. |

### 5. Quality + compliance + decisions

| # | Document | What it covers |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 7 | [QA — Test Plan + IFD Compliance](../../../../roles/qa/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__response-to-daily-brief-2__13-feb.md) | 53 new tests (total target ~144). IFD compliance checklist (8 checks). Regression risk: cache service as single point of failure (HIGH). GA removal, token migration risk assessed. Sherpa tracking metrics for sharing methods + themes. |
| 8 | [Historian — Decision Log](../../../../roles/historian/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__response-to-daily-brief-2__13-feb.md) | 10 new decisions (D024-D033). 5 named patterns: Adopt-evaluate-reverse, Gravity component, Compliance-to-feature, Foundation before facade, Expand through abstraction. D024 is first strategic reversal. 33 total decisions logged. |
| 9 | [Journalist — Content + Messaging](../../../../roles/journalist/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__response-to-daily-brief-2__13-feb.md) | Zero-cookie landing page copy (3 options). Privacy policy draft. Transparency panel UI copy (all states). Competitive positioning table. Community token invitation message. Token usage UI messaging. 5 claims flagged for AppSec verification. |

## Key decisions from this session

| Decision | Summary | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| D024 | **Google Analytics removed** — first strategic reversal. 5 HIGH-risk reasons to remove, 0 HIGH to keep. | **APPROVED** unanimously (DPO, AppSec, Architect, Conductor) |
| D025 | **No-Cookie Policy** — zero cookies, no consent banners, provable privacy claim | **APPROVED** |
| D026 | **Cache service as central data backbone** — built on Memory-FS, 4 namespaces (analytics, tokens, costs, transfers) | **APPROVED** — Architect schema delivered |
| D027 | **LETS pipeline (on-demand, cascading save)** — raw events → 30min → hourly → daily → monthly | **APPROVED** |
| D028 | **Human-friendly tokens** via cache hash (SHA-256) — "community-x" not GUIDs | **APPROVED** (AppSec: use SHA-256 with static salt) |
| D029 | **Token usage limits** — foundation for commercial model | **APPROVED** |
| D030 | **Local storage transparency panel** — opt-in key caching, zero-storage mode | **APPROVED** with 7 AppSec conditions |
| D031 | **IFD non-negotiable** — merge gate, QA verifies, Conductor enforces | **POLICY** |
| D032 | **Admin UI first** for modular event-driven architecture | **APPROVED** |
| D033 | **AWS cost tracking from day one** — unit economics via LETS | **APPROVED** |

## What's next — Phase 1 implementation (no blockers)

The Conductor's Phase 1 is **already unblocked** and should start immediately:

| # | Task | Est. | Source |
|---|------|------|--------|
| 1 | **Hash-fragment URLs** — Architect + AppSec approved (Brief #1), Dev plan ready | 2-3h | Brief #1 D014 |
| 2 | **Text input mode** — encrypt text, not just files | 4-6h | Brief #1 |
| 3 | **i18n foundation** — must land before ALL new UI content (themes, landing page, transparency panel) | 6-8h | Brief #1 D017 |
| 4 | **DevOps Tier 1 logging** — quick win, <$1/month | Quick | Brief #1 |

**Cache-dependent work (Phases 2-5) is now unblocked** — the Architect delivered the cache service schema in their Brief #2 response. Dev can start cache service core implementation.

**Critical path for GA removal:** Cache service core → analytics raw event recording → LETS pulse computation → daily aggregation → GA removed.

## Risk highlights

| Risk | Severity | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| RF-15: Cache service schema delay | Critical | **RESOLVED** — Architect delivered schema in this session |
| RF-17: GA removed before analytics ready | Medium | **Mitigated** — explicit gate: analytics must answer 2 questions first |
| RF-18: LETS aggregation correctness | Medium | Open — QA has 16 cache service tests specified |
| RF-21: Scope expansion (5 cache consumers) | Medium | **Mitigated** — strict phasing (analytics → tokens → costs) |
| RF-22: No CloudFront logs yet | Medium | Active — DPO must sign off IP masking before enabling |

## Cross-brief integration

| Brief #1 Topic | Brief #2 Evolution |
|---|---|
| Google Analytics integration | **Replaced.** Unanimous recommendation to remove. Server-side analytics via cache service. |
| Observability (collect → S3) | **Refined.** Cache service + LETS pipeline replaces standalone S3 data lake. |
| Admin tokens (GUID-based) | **Superseded.** Human-friendly names + cache hash + usage limits. |
| Hash-fragment URLs | **Unchanged.** Still approved, ready to implement. |
| i18n foundation | **Reinforced.** Even more UI coming — i18n is more urgent. |
| Themes (5 variants) | **Unchanged.** Ready after i18n. |
| Email sharing | **Unchanged.** Ready after hash-fragment URLs. |
