## What happened

You published the 13 Feb daily brief with first real-user feedback and UX priorities. All 10 agentic roles reviewed it and produced responses. This debrief summarises the output and tells you what to read.

**Your amendments were incorporated throughout:**
- Rate limiting deferred to later (needs visualisation first) → Decision D015
- CORS already handled by osbot-fast-api → Decision D016

## Key decisions needing your awareness

| Decision | Summary | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| D014 | Hash-fragment URLs approved (Architect + AppSec) | **APPROVED** — ready to implement |
| D015 | Rate limiting deferred (per your amendment) | Accepted |
| D016 | CORS handled by osbot-fast-api (per your amendment) | Confirmed |
| D017 | i18n must be built BEFORE any new UI content | Sequencing constraint |
| D018 | Observability Tier 1 enable now (<$1/month) | Ready to action |
| D019 | Admin tokens: query string (not hash) by design | Architectural choice |
| D020 | Text input uses same AES-256-GCM pipeline as files | Symmetric design |
| D021 | Five themes: Dark, High Contrast, Aurora, Glacier, Ember | CSS-variable based |
| D022 | Separate S3 bucket for observability data | Security boundary |
| D023 | Milestone M003: first real user reached | Recorded |

## What's next

The Conductor's Phase B (P1 implementation) is ready to start. The recommended first tasks are:

1. **Hash-fragment URLs** — both Architect and AppSec have approved, Dev has the implementation plan (2-3h)
2. **i18n foundation** — must be in place before Journalist content or themes can land (6-8h)
3. **DevOps Tier 1 logging** — quick win, <$1/month, do it now
