# Final Debrief: v0.1.3 Role Reviews — 13 Feb 2026

**Version:** v0.2.33
**Date:** 13 February 2026
**Session:** `claude/read-secure-send-brief-Mz6yN`
**Triggered by:** [v0.1.3 Wrap-Up Debrief](v0.2.33__debrief__v0.1.3-wrap-up.md) + LinkedIn post
**Follows:** [Brief #1 Debrief](v0.2.32__debrief__daily-brief-responses-13-feb.md) | [Brief #2 Debrief](v0.2.33__debrief__daily-brief-2-responses-13-feb.md) | [v0.1.3 Wrap-Up](v0.2.33__debrief__v0.1.3-wrap-up.md)

## What happened

You asked 6 roles to review the v0.1.3 wrap-up debrief and the LinkedIn Klingon post. All 6 delivered. Two roles (Advocate and Ambassador) activated for the first time. The Sherpa, Historian, and Conductor deepened their existing work. The Journalist produced a full content calendar with ready-to-post LinkedIn drafts.

**The headline finding across all 6 reviews:** The product is earning trust faster than it is explaining itself. The next sprint must close that gap.

## Recommended reading order

### 1. Start here — what to do next

| # | Document | Why read it |
|---|----------|-------------|
| 1 | [Conductor — Session Wrap-Up](../../../../roles/conductor/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up.md) | **The execution compass.** 7-phase plan status (Phase 0-1 complete, Phase 2 is the next session's main event). 5 prioritised next-session tasks. 3 new risks identified (RF-23: zero analytics is P0). Honest deviation analysis — GA removed ahead of the sequencing gate, and it was the right call. |

### 2. Content + external strategy — the LinkedIn follow-up

| # | Document | Why read it |
|---|----------|-------------|
| 2 | [Journalist — Content Strategy + LinkedIn Drafts](../../../../roles/journalist/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md) | **5 ready-to-post LinkedIn drafts** (zero cookies x3, same-day ship, IFD methodology, agentic team). 7-day content calendar. 22 new i18n key recommendations for landing page. 5 key external messages ranked. Analysis of what worked in the Klingon post and what could be stronger (missing product URL, no CTA, no "what it does" line). |
| 3 | [Ambassador — Market Positioning + Growth](../../../../roles/ambassador/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md) | **First activation.** The "Triple-Zero Position" (zero cookies + zero knowledge + multilingual). Competitive comparison table (needs fact-checking before publishing). Token-based community seeding plan: 7 communities, 4,200 transfers in Phase 1. LinkedIn-to-product pipeline design. 5 stories ranked by external impact. Core thesis: "SGraph Send's strongest marketing asset is verifiability." |

### 3. User perspective — trust + friction + accessibility

| # | Document | Why read it |
|---|----------|-------------|
| 4 | [Sherpa — Friction Scorecard + LinkedIn Trail](../../../../roles/sherpa/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md) | **Friction scorecard updated:** 2 resolved (F002 split-channel, F005 filename), 2 partial, 9 open. 4 new friction points identified from i18n (F014-F017 including the token gate bug you just reported). LinkedIn-to-product trail design: UTM parameters, community tokens, complete funnel instrumentation. Two-phase friendlies rollout plan with metrics targets. **Immediate action: add a token link to the LinkedIn post comments** (`send.sgraph.ai/?token=linkedin-klingon&ref=li`). |
| 5 | [Advocate — Trust Assessment + Accessibility](../../../../roles/advocate/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md) | **First activation.** Trust assessment per persona (Security Pro, Compliance Officer, Freelancer, Developer, new Community Member persona). 6 accessibility gaps found (HIGH: no keyboard access to drop zone, no aria-live for state changes, no lang attribute on fallback strings). LaunchList third-party script flagged as contradiction with zero-tracking narrative. localStorage writes flagged as trust risk. RTL readiness assessment. Verdict: "The product is earning trust faster than it is explaining itself." |

### 4. Historical record

| # | Document | Why read it |
|---|----------|-------------|
| 6 | [Historian — Milestones + Patterns + Decision Log](../../../../roles/historian/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up.md) | **6 milestones recorded** (M004-M009). 5 named patterns (brief-to-ship velocity, additive versioning, productive reversal, demand-triggered activation, ship-then-show). Decision log D014-D033 with implementation status. Velocity comparison: v0.1.3 session produced 3x the output of the infrastructure sprint in 25% of the time. Decision numbering conflict documented (launch-day vs daily-brief numbering epochs). |

## Key findings across all 6 reviews

### Unanimous agreement

| Finding | Raised by |
|---------|-----------|
| **Landing page content is the #1 user-facing gap.** Every new visitor — especially from LinkedIn — hits the "what is this?" problem. | Conductor, Sherpa (F001), Advocate (A-01), Journalist, Ambassador |
| **Zero analytics is the #1 operational gap.** GA removed, no replacement yet. Flying blind on a publicly-announced product. | Conductor (RF-23, P0), Sherpa (attribution gap), Ambassador (pipeline gap) |
| **The "zero cookies" narrative is the next big external story.** | Journalist (3 draft variations), Ambassador (Story #1), Advocate (strongest trust signal) |
| **The Klingon post works but needs a product link and CTA.** | Journalist (recommendations), Ambassador (pipeline gap), Advocate (no product explanation) |

### Cross-role tensions worth noting

| Tension | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **LaunchList third-party script vs zero-tracking claim** | Advocate (A-03) and Ambassador (risk register) both flag that loading `getlaunchlist.com/js/widget-diy.js` contradicts the principle that led to GA removal. AppSec should review before the "zero third-party scripts" claim goes public. |
| **localStorage writes vs zero-storage narrative** | Advocate (A-02) flags that `sgraph-send-locale` is written without consent. The Sherpa notes locale persistence is good UX. Resolution: make it opt-in or disclose it in the transparency panel. |
| **Klingon as trust signal: double-edged** | Sherpa (F017) notes Klingon may undermine seriousness for enterprise users. Ambassador and Journalist love it for developer/community audiences. Resolution: keep visible for friendlies, consider a "developer mode" toggle for enterprise contexts later. |
| **Plan-to-execution ratio** | Conductor (RF-25) flags too much planning relative to shipping. Recommends capping role responses at 3-5 per brief in the next session. Focus on code. |

## Bug confirmed: Token gate page not translated (F015)

You reported this with a screenshot during this session. The Sherpa independently identified it as **F015** in the friction scorecard:

> The access gate (`send-access-gate.js`, v0.1.0) shows "Beta Access" and "Enter your access token to start sending files" in English regardless of the selected locale.

**Fix target:** v0.1.4 — add ~10 `gate.*` i18n keys to all 4 locale files and wire through `I18n.t()`.

## New roles activated this session

| Role | First Document | Key Contribution |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Advocate** | [Trust Assessment](../../../../roles/advocate/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md) | 12 prioritised recommendations (A-01 through A-12). 6 accessibility gaps. Persona benefit matrix. New "Community Member" persona proposed. |
| **Ambassador** | [Market Positioning](../../../../roles/ambassador/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md) | Competitive comparison table. Community seeding plan. LinkedIn pipeline design. 5 external stories ranked. Messaging principles: "State facts. Provide evidence. Let the audience verify." |

**Updated role activation count:** 14 of 14 roles have now produced at least one document. Zero dormant roles remain.

---

## Next session priorities (Conductor's stack)

```
P0  [1] Operational visibility — confirm logging, ship pulse endpoint
P0  [2] Cache service core implementation (gating item for Phases 3-5)
P1  [3] Landing page content integration (Journalist copy ready)
P2  [4] Email sharing (copy-as-text + Gmail link)
P2  [5] Theme system (5 CSS-variable themes)
```

The Conductor's directive: **"Open with operational visibility. Cache service is the main event. Run one UI track in parallel. Limit planning overhead. Ship code."**

---

## Immediate actions for you

| # | Action | Why now |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Add a comment to the LinkedIn post** with a token link: `send.sgraph.ai/?token=linkedin-klingon&ref=li` | The Sherpa designed the complete attribution funnel. Every day without a token link is unmeasured traffic. |
| 2 | **Reply to every comment on the Klingon post.** | Each reply boosts algorithmic visibility. The Ambassador and Journalist both recommend this. |
| 3 | **Review the Journalist's LinkedIn drafts** and pick one for tomorrow (Friday 14 Feb). The "zero cookies" Variation C is recommended as the strongest. | The 7-day content calendar starts tomorrow. |
| 4 | **Decide on the LaunchList question.** Keep it or self-host? The Advocate flagged it. AppSec should verify before any "no third-party scripts" claim goes public. | Consistency of principle before public claims. |
