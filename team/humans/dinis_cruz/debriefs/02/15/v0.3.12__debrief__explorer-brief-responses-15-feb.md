# Debrief: v0.3.12 Explorer Brief Responses — 15 Feb 2026

**Version:** v0.3.12
**Date:** 15 February 2026
**Session:** `claude/read-explorer-guidance-StQko`
**Triggered by:** [v0.3.10 Daily Brief — Explorer Team](../../briefs/02/15/v0.3.10__daily-brief__explorer-team-15-feb-2026.md)
**Previous debrief:** [v0.3.2 Explorer Action Plans](v0.3.2__debrief__explorer-action-plans.md)

---

## Executive Summary

This session delivered **11 action plans from 11 roles** in response to the first Explorer-team-specific daily brief (v0.3.10). Every role acknowledged their assigned tasks, reconciled carry-forward items from v0.3.2, and produced a concrete plan.

**Key outcomes:**

1. **Conductor produced a 4-wave sprint plan** covering all 22 tasks across three tracks: UX bug fixes, SA dashboard foundation, and resilience research
2. **Architect identified two blocking deliverables** — cache service usage mapping and path-based routing design — that gate 8 of Dev's 20 tasks
3. **Dev acknowledged 20 tasks**, sized them (5S, 6M, 7L, 1XL), and recommended splitting the two largest (#5 and #7) into incremental sub-tasks
4. **AppSec delivered the three-word key security review** — verdict: conditionally viable for non-sensitive files, never as default, never replacing AES-256-GCM
5. **Designer delivered the token usage UI spec** — unblocks Dev task #14
6. **Historian recorded milestone M015** (LETS pipeline live, privacy-by-design validated) and corrected a decision numbering collision (D048-D052, not D038-D042)
7. **QA defined 38 new tests** (20 QUnit, 6 pytest, 6 Playwright, 6 smoke) bringing total test backlog to 84

## Reading Order

**If you read three documents:** Conductor, Architect, Dev (the execution backbone).

**If you read five documents:** Add AppSec (three-word key verdict) and Designer (token usage UI spec — actionable deliverable).

## Sprint Shape: Fix, Build, Research

The Conductor's plan distils the 22-task brief into three tracks executed across four waves:

### Track A: UX Bug Fixes (Wave 1-2)

**Goal:** Ship every user-facing P1 bug fix. No user should encounter these bugs for another session.

| Wave | Tasks | What Ships |
|------|-------|------------|
| **Wave 1** | #1 (download loading), #2 (token expiry), #3 (token-aware state), #5 (upload progress), #6 (navigation guard) | 5 user-facing P1 fixes |
| **Wave 2** | #4 (Analytics Pulse), #18 (admin links) | 2 admin fixes |

Dev notes #6 is a one-liner, #2 is a simple conditional, #1 is a load-order fix. The hard one is #5 (upload progress) — Dev recommends splitting into #5a (basic stage indicators, S) and #5b (percentage-based progress, M).

### Track B: SA Dashboard Foundation (Wave 2-3)

**Goal:** Cache browser operational. Path-based routing live.

| Wave | Tasks | What Ships |
|------|-------|------------|
| **Wave 2** | Architect delivers: #9 (cache mapping), #17 (routing spec), #11 (manifest spec) | 3 unblocking specifications |
| **Wave 3a** | #17 (routing implementation), #7 (cache browser) | SA dashboard foundation |
| **Wave 3b** | #10, #11, #16, #8, #14 (parallel) | Token perf fix, version switcher, timing capture, token counter |

**Critical path:** Architect must deliver cache mapping (#9) and routing design (#17) in Wave 2. Everything downstream stalls if these are late.

### Track C: Research (Wave 4)

| Tasks | What Ships |
|-------|------------|
| #19 (upload/download resilience), #20 (three-word key) | Research documents |

## Decisions Needed

Five decisions surfaced by the Conductor, plus four architecture decisions from the Architect:

### Conductor's Decisions (Action Required)

| # | Decision | Urgency | Context |
|---|----------|---------|---------|
| 1 | **Three missing UI elements code** (#16) — share implementation for API call log, event log, message panel | Before Wave 3b | Brief says "I have working code in other projects" |
| 2 | **Three-word key go/no-go** — after AppSec review (conditionally viable), product decision | Wave 4 | AppSec says viable for non-sensitive files only |
| 3 | **Cache browser V1 scope** — minimal (list + inspect) or comprehensive (all described features)? | Before Wave 3 | Affects Dev scope |
| 4 | **SA dashboard hosting** — which Lambda serves `/admin/dashboard/*`? | Before Wave 3 | Affects routing design |
| 5 | **Resilience briefing timeline** — is the separate detailed briefing coming soon? | Before Wave 4 | Affects Architect research scheduling |

### Architect's Decisions (AD-7 to AD-10)

| ID | Decision | Preliminary Recommendation |
|----|----------|---------------------------|
| AD-7 | SA dashboard routing approach | Option B: client-side router + Lambda catch-all (most IFD-consistent) |
| AD-8 | Cache service token data structure | Fact-finding — cache mapping (D1) will answer this |
| AD-9 | IFD version manifest format | `/admin/v0/v0.1/manifest.json`, JSON format proposed |
| AD-10 | Dashboard layout with debug panels | Collapsible bottom panel (DevTools-style) — decided with routing design |

## Key Findings Across Roles

### AppSec: Three-Word Key Verdict

**Conditionally viable.** The security review concludes:
- Entropy is insufficient to resist targeted brute-force — three words from a 2048-word list = ~33 bits vs. 256 bits for AES-256-GCM
- Must never be the default sharing mode
- Must never replace the full key for security-conscious users
- Viable as a **convenience option for non-sensitive files** with server-side rate limiting
- Offline attacks must be made infeasible by design (key derivation must involve server-side component)

### Historian: Decision Numbering Collision

The Librarian's master index labelled new decisions D038-D042, but the Historian's v0.3.2 record already used D038-D047. **Correct numbering is D048-D052.** Librarian should update the master index.

### Dev: Workload Risk

20 tasks is the single biggest execution risk. Dev recommends:
- Splitting #5 (upload progress) into #5a (S) + #5b (M)
- Splitting #7 (cache browser) into #7a (listing, M) + #7b (temporal navigation, M) + #7c (entry inspection, M)
- Treating #7 + #17 as a single work item (entangled)
- P3 items (#21, #22) will not be reached this cycle

### QA: Test Backlog

38 new tests from this brief + 46 carry-forward from v0.3.0 admin UI = **84 total tests**. QA recommends tests are written alongside each bug fix, not batched.

## Risks

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|----|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **RF-37** | Dev overload — 20 tasks cause context-switching | HIGH | High | Wave discipline, P3 optional |
| **RF-38** | Architect specs delayed — SA dashboard stalls | Medium | High | Time-box specs, existing docs to build on |
| **RF-39** | Missing UI elements (#16) blocked on human code | Medium | Medium | Request code early |
| **RF-40** | Cache browser scope creep | Medium | Medium | Ship V1 minimal |
| **RF-41** | Upload progress events harder than expected | Low-Med | Medium | Accept approximation |
| **RF-42** | Path-based routing vs Lambda URL routing conflict | Low | High | Client-side SPA routing, verify Lambda serves catch-all |
| **RF-43** | Token-aware page state edge cases | Low | Low | Validate token freshness, not just presence |

---

## What's Next

1. **Immediate:** Start Wave 1 — Dev implements the 5 user-facing P1 bug fixes (no dependencies, can start now)
2. **Parallel:** Architect begins D1 (cache service usage mapping) to unblock Dev Wave 3
3. **Decision gate:** Before Wave 3, need answers on cache browser scope, SA dashboard hosting, and the missing UI elements code
4. **Carry-forward:** Issues FS adoption, design agency brief review, handover briefs — all continue as background obligations

---

## Librarian Updates Needed

1. Update master index decision numbering: D038-D042 should be D048-D052 (per Historian)
2. Add new architecture decisions AD-7 to AD-10 to the decision register
3. Add new risks RF-37 to RF-43 to the risk register
4. Track the 11 action plans as deliverables in the next master index

*Debrief complete. 11 roles responded. Sprint plan defined. Awaiting Wave 1 execution and 5 human decisions.*
