# Debrief: v0.3.2 Explorer Action Plans — 15 Feb 2026

**Version:** v0.3.2
**Date:** 15 February 2026
**Session:** `claude/read-explorer-guidance-StQko`
**Triggered by:** [v0.3.2 Daily Brief](../../briefs/02/14/v0.3.2__daily-brief__sgraph-send-14-feb-2026.md)
**Previous debrief:** [v0.3.0 Daily Brief Responses & Admin UI](../14/v0.3.0__debrief__daily-brief-responses-and-admin-ui.md)

---

## Executive Summary

This session delivered **13 documents from 12 Explorer-relevant roles** in response to the v0.3.2 daily brief. Every role read the briefs, reviewed their own previous work, and produced a concrete action plan for the Explorer track.

The session operated from the **Explorer perspective** — all action plans focus on discovery, experimentation, and building first versions. Villager-track items (production deployment, performance optimisation) are explicitly noted as out of scope.

**Key outcomes:**
1. Complete role-to-brief mapping and master index (Librarian)
2. 11 Explorer action plans with concrete next steps
3. **6 architectural decisions flagged for your input** (AD-1 through AD-6)
4. A critical finding: **AppSec rates handover NOT READY** until security gaps are closed
5. A critical finding: **large file transfer is non-functional** — Sherpa confirmed current upload breaks at ~50MB (memory + 20MB Lambda limit)
6. Recommended headline from Ambassador: **"Send files the server can't read."**

## Recommended Reading Order

1. **Start here** — [Conductor Sprint Plan](../../../roles/conductor/reviews/26-02-14/v0.3.2__action-plan__explorer-next-steps.md) — the sequenced plan for everything
2. **Architecture** — [Architect Action Plan](../../../roles/architect/reviews/26-02-14/v0.3.2__action-plan__explorer-next-steps.md) — technical decisions and research
3. **Security gate** — [AppSec Action Plan](../../../roles/appsec/reviews/26-02-14/v0.3.2__action-plan__explorer-next-steps.md) — the handover readiness verdict
4. **Positioning** — [Ambassador Action Plan](../../../roles/ambassador/reviews/26-02-14/v0.3.2__action-plan__explorer-next-steps.md) — competitive landscape and differentiator
5. **User perspective** — [Advocate Action Plan](../../../roles/advocate/reviews/26-02-14/v0.3.2__action-plan__explorer-next-steps.md) — personas and user journey analysis
6. **The map** — [Cartographer Action Plan](../../../roles/cartographer/reviews/26-02-14/v0.3.2__action-plan__explorer-next-steps.md) — evolution map and handover pipeline
7. **Skim the rest** as needed — Designer, Dev, Journalist, Sherpa, Historian

## Critical Findings

### 1. Handover NOT READY (AppSec)

AppSec assessed the 5 MVP components for Villager handover and found **security gaps in Categories C-F** (Input Validation, Security Headers, Data Protection, Operational Security). Categories A-B (Encryption Integrity, Auth/AuthZ) pass. The Explorer team must close these gaps before any handover.

**Impact:** The Villager team cannot start productising until AppSec clears the handover checklist (21 items across 6 categories).

### 2. Large File Transfer is Broken (Sherpa)

The Sherpa performed a code-level audit and confirmed:
- `FileReader.readAsArrayBuffer()` loads the entire file into browser memory
- Encryption doubles the memory footprint
- Lambda URL has a 20MB payload limit
- **Result:** Files >50MB will likely fail; 1GB+ is completely non-functional

**Impact:** The "large file sweet spot" from user feedback requires the chunked upload architecture the Architect designed (chunk-then-encrypt with per-chunk retry).

### 3. Architect is the Bottleneck (Conductor)

The Conductor identified the Architect as the bottleneck across 3 of 4 parallel workstreams (design agency technical context, large file architecture, handover briefs). Sequencing recommendation: design agency input first, then large file architecture, then handovers, then bot research.

## Decisions Needing Your Input

Six architectural decisions are pending. The first three block the Villager team:

| ID | Decision | Options | Architect Recommendation | Blocks |
|----|----------|---------|--------------------------|--------|
| **AD-1** | Environment separation strategy | (A) Separate AWS accounts, (B) Same account separate resources, (C) Same account separate stacks | **Option B** — same account, naming conventions | Villager infra setup |
| **AD-2** | Handover brief format | 7-section template proposed | **Approve proposed format** | First handover |
| **AD-3** | Branching strategy for two teams | (A) Explorer on `dev`, Villager on `release/*`, (B) Explorer on `dev`, Villager on `main`, (C) Separate repos | **Option A** — `release/*` branches | Villager CI/CD |
| **AD-4** | Large file transfer approach | Chunk-then-encrypt vs encrypt-then-chunk | **Chunk-then-encrypt** (5MB chunks, independent encryption) | Large file feature |
| **AD-5** | Unencrypted mode go/no-go | Yes (conditional) / No | **Conditional yes** (AppSec: 8 mandatory conditions; Advocate: conditional yes; Ambassador: not yet, focus on encryption story) | Feature scope |
| **AD-6** | External partner communication channel | Slack / WhatsApp / Both | **Slack first** (lower friction, better tooling) | Bot integration |

## Key Recommendations Across Roles

| Theme | Recommendation | From |
|-------|---------------|------|
| **Positioning** | "Send files the server can't read." as primary headline | Ambassador |
| **Personas** | 4 defined: Security-Conscious Pro, Large-File Sender, Enterprise Admin, Privacy Advocate | Advocate |
| **Firefox Send vacancy** | Firefox Send shut down in 2020 — that market segment is underserved | Ambassador |
| **Design system, not a design** | Agency must understand multi-theme, multi-language from day one | Designer |
| **Handover format** | 7-section template proposed, needs approval (AD-2) | Architect |
| **IFD consolidation** | v0.2.0 must merge all v0.1.x into single baseline before handover | Dev |
| **Issues FS** | 6 `.issues` files proposed for active workstreams | Conductor |
| **Milestone recorded** | Explorer/Villager split = M014, logged with 10 decisions (D038-D047) | Historian |
| **21 components mapped** | Full Wardley evolution map with handover pipeline visual | Cartographer |
| **Design agency as user** | They become a real user — observation plan ready with friction predictions | Sherpa |

## What's Next

1. **Dinis decides AD-1 through AD-6** — these unblock multiple workstreams
2. **AppSec handover checklist** — Explorer team closes security gaps in Categories C-F
3. **Architect produces design agency technical context** — unblocked, can start immediately
4. **Designer assembles design agency brief** — once Architect, Advocate, Ambassador inputs are ready
5. **Conductor creates `.issues` files** — for all 6 active workstreams
6. **Dev starts IFD v0.2.0 consolidation** — prerequisite for Villager handover
7. **First Villager session** — once AD-1/AD-2/AD-3 are decided and security gaps are closed
