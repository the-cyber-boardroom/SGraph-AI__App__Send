# v0.5.0 — Debrief: Villager Catch-Up 19–21 February 2026

**Version:** v0.5.0
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Role:** Librarian
**Session:** Villager team
**Master index:** [`v0.5.0__master-index__villager-team-19-to-21-feb.md`](../../../villager/roles/librarian/reviews/26-02-21/v0.5.0__master-index__villager-team-19-to-21-feb.md)

## 1. Executive Summary

The Explorer team had its most intensive period since launch: 92 commits across 3 days, two incidents resolved, PKI messaging MVP built and deployed, investor validation secured, and the strategic direction pivoted to PKI. The Villager team had zero activity during this period.

**Three things matter for the Villager team:**

1. **PKI is now deployed and strategic** — admin UI v0.1.2 with pki.html (1830-line component) is live in production. Deployment packaging must include it. 25 AppSec findings (2 critical) must be addressed before a Villager production release.

2. **Two incidents hardened the process** — INC-003 (100-minute hotfix) and INC-004 (data breach, contained) produced reusable incident response processes, data breach notification templates, and URL sanitisation tests. The Villager team should adopt these.

3. **The backlog is growing** — operational runbooks, deployment packaging, Accountant role, and visitor programme remain unactioned since their first dispatch 3 days ago. Combined with new PKI-related tasks, the Villager backlog is now 41 items.

## 2. What Happened (19–21 Feb)

### 19 Feb — Two Incidents in One Afternoon

- **INC-003** (P4-as-P1): Access tokens embedded in shareable URLs. Hotfixed in 100 minutes. All 6 IFD versions patched simultaneously. Zero data compromised.
- **INC-004** (P2-as-P1): Real credentials committed in documentation. Confirmed data breach — 30-minute containment, S3 object deleted, user notified, ICO notification not required (Level 1 public data).
- **Immune system gains**: Data breach notification process, ICO reporting framework, redaction convention, URL sanitisation tests, simultaneous IFD patching pattern, 12 decisions, 3 patterns.

### 20 Feb — Investor Validation and PKI MVP

- **Investor meeting**: Group validated PKI as "killer feature" — *"send documents encrypted to a specific recipient, no key exchange."* PKI moves from feature to strategic direction.
- **New classification**: B0-B10 (business priority) axis alongside P0-P10 (security) and D0-D10 (development).
- **PKI MVP built and deployed**: RSA-OAEP encryption + ECDSA digital signatures. Client-side only, zero dependencies. Admin pki.html page live. LinkedIn announcement published.
- **"SigSend"** emerged as organic brand name from investor conversation.

### 21 Feb — Architecture Design

- **Chain of trust**: Key graphs as trust relationships, git-style hash chaining for tamper evidence, key rotation with identity anchors.
- **Secure pod**: Solves the "encryption trilemma" (zero-knowledge + multi-user + revocable access) via intermediary enclave. Research stage.
- **Key discovery**: Next build priority — friendly key lookup (short codes), public key registry, 4 new API endpoints.
- **AppSec**: 25 risk findings across all PKI briefs. 2 critical (auth on publish, proof-of-possession). Must be resolved before production.

## 6. Recommended Reading Order

For Dinis — to review the Villager team's catch-up:

1. **This debrief** — you're reading it
2. [Master index](../../../villager/roles/librarian/reviews/26-02-21/v0.5.0__master-index__villager-team-19-to-21-feb.md) — full catalogue with task dispatch (Section 8)
3. [AppSec: Read Now (PKI findings)](../../roles/appsec/reviews/26-02-21/v0.5.0__appsec__read-now.md) — 25 findings, 2 critical
4. [AppSec: Auth Model Transition Risk](../../roles/appsec/reviews/26-02-21/v0.5.0__grc-risk__auth-model-transition.md) — token→PKI transition

---

## 7. What's Next

### Highest-value Villager work right now

1. **GRC: Write P0 and P1 runbooks** — 3 days overdue, operational maturity blocker
2. **DevOps: Start deployment packaging** — must now include admin UI v0.1.2 with PKI
3. **AppSec: Review 2 critical PKI findings** — must be resolved before production release
4. **QA: Update regression baseline** — add URL sanitisation + PKI verification tests
5. **Conductor: Create Accountant role** — still pending

### Cost-Effectiveness Note

The Explorer team's pace (92 commits in 3 days) is outrunning the Villager team's ability to process. The Villager team has not produced a single review since 16 Feb. This gap is acceptable during the Explorer's Genesis/Custom-Built phase, but becomes critical as features approach Product stage. The PKI messaging MVP is now deployed — this is the first capability that should trigger Villager hardening work.
