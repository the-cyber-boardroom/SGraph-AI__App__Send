# v0.5.8 -- Debrief: CBR Investment Cross-Project Review

**Version:** v0.5.8
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Roles:** Librarian, Ambassador, Alchemist, Accountant (Town Planner team)
**Source:** `https://github.com/the-cyber-boardroom/cbr-investment.git`
**Session:** Four-role review of CBR investment materials for cross-project knowledge transfer to SG/Send

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Four Town Planner roles reviewed the 26 documents (~80,000 words) in the CBR investment repository. The repository contains mature investment strategy, business planning, and financial modelling materials built for The Cyber Boardroom -- your other startup that shares the same founder, technology stack, and strategic philosophy.

**Key finding:** The CBR materials solve approximately 60% of SG/Send's investor documentation gaps. The remaining 40% is SG/Send's unique gold -- zero-knowledge encryption, PKI, the agentic team at scale, and incident response maturity. The combination is more compelling than either project alone.

**Three transformative concepts from CBR for SG/Send:**

1. **"Don't fabricate projections -- discover pricing."** The serverless financial model eliminates the need for speculative revenue forecasts. Instead: define billable units, set hypothesis prices, test with real customers.
2. **"No kill date."** Near-zero idle costs mean SG/Send can operate indefinitely while discovering product-market fit. The investment narrative is capital efficiency, not runway anxiety.
3. **"Hypothesis-driven development."** Every feature must create a billable unit. This discipline prevents feature bloat and ensures every investment pound creates measurable value.

## 2. Recommended Reading Order

### Must-Read (10 minutes)

1. **This debrief** -- you are reading it
2. **[Accountant review](../../../town-planner/roles/accountant/reviews/26-02-21/v0.5.8__review__cbr-investment-financial-philosophy.md)** -- the most actionable review. Defines billable units, cost-per-unit model, and the "discover don't fabricate" philosophy. Section 2 is essential.

### If You Have 15 More Minutes

3. **[Alchemist review](../../../town-planner/roles/alchemist/reviews/26-02-21/v0.5.8__review__cbr-investment-transmutation-assessment.md)** -- the transmutation map: what to extract from CBR, what to adapt, what's uniquely SG/Send. Section 4 proposes the full 11-document investor materials suite.
4. **[Ambassador review](../../../roles/ambassador/reviews/26-02-21/v0.5.8__review__cbr-investment-messaging-transfer.md)** -- messaging gaps exposed by CBR comparison, transferable narratives, the "hostile FAQ" pattern. Section 6 has the strongest single investor message.

### Reference

5. **[Librarian catalogue](../../../town-planner/roles/librarian/reviews/26-02-21/v0.5.8__review__cbr-investment-catalogue.md)** -- full inventory of all 26 documents with transfer value ratings. 14 documents rated HIGH or CRITICAL.

### Addendum (investor.myfeeds.ai)

6. **[Website review addendum](../../../town-planner/roles/librarian/reviews/26-02-21/v0.5.8__addendum__investor-myfeeds-ai-website-review.md)** -- review of the live investor portal. 5 additional ideas (#21-25). CBR investment parameters: €300K/20%/€1.5M (Portugal). **SG/Send confirmed: £300K for 20% at £1.5M post-money, UK-based, SEIS/EIS eligible.**

### Accountant: Financial Philosophy and Pricing Discovery

- **Core principle adopted:** "Discover pricing, don't fabricate projections"
- **5 billable units defined** for SG/Send: transfer, storage-day, PKI key exchange, deployment instance, API call
- **Cost-per-unit model** proposed (rough estimates, needs validation from AWS billing)
- **7 deliverables proposed:** cost model, foundation cost measurement, scale projections, billable units definition, deployment cost comparison, investment allocation, pricing hypothesis document
- **Key framework:** 60/20/20 investment allocation (strategic projects / market discovery / content creation)
- **Critical data point needed:** SG/Send's actual monthly foundation cost (CBR claims ~5/month)

## 4. Consolidated Ideas and Concepts to Bring to SG/Send

### Tier 1: Adopt Wholesale (Same Philosophy, Same Architecture)

| # | Concept | Source | Impact |
|---|---------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **Serverless company = no kill date** | `serverless-financial-model-and-growth-strategy.md` | Reframes the entire investment narrative from "runway" to "capital efficiency" |
| 2 | **Hypothesis-driven development** | `serverless-financial-model-and-growth-strategy.md` | Every feature must create a billable unit. Prevents feature bloat. |
| 3 | **"Discover pricing, don't fabricate projections"** | Multiple CBR docs | Accountant produces cost models, not revenue forecasts. More credible. |
| 4 | **60/20/20 investment allocation** | `serverless-financial-model-and-growth-strategy.md` | 60% strategic projects, 20% market discovery, 20% content creation |
| 5 | **SEIS/EIS qualification** | `investment-strategy-analysis.md` | Tax-efficient investment structure for UK angels — **confirmed: SG/Send is UK-based, SEIS/EIS applies** |
| 6 | **Open source as competitive advantage** | `cbr-business-plan.v0.9.md` | "We monetise the service, not the code. Anyone can verify our encryption." |

### Tier 2: Adapt Framework (CBR Structure, SG/Send Content)

### Tier 3: Import Concept (Ideas, Not Documents)

| # | Concept | Source | SG/Send Application |
|---|---------|--------|---------------------|
| 15 | **Hostile FAQ** | `engineering-in-the-llm-era.md` | Pre-emptive answers to investor skepticism about ZK encryption, single founder, AI team |
| 16 | **"LLMs as commodity" → "Encryption as commodity"** | `llms-as-a-commodity-strategy.md` | Provider-agnostic approach: value is in orchestration, not the encryption library |
| 17 | **"Three Amigos" → Three Teams** | `llms-demand-more-engineering-not-less.md` | Explorer/Villager/Town Planner separation maps to Business/Product/Technology |
| 18 | **Investor as user** | `investor-user-journey.md` | "Your first SG/Send experience is receiving this pitch deck securely" |
| 19 | **Provenance chains → Cryptographic verification** | `provenance-of-trust-news.md` | Trust is mathematical, not contractual |

## 5. Decisions Needed

| # | Decision | Context | Recommended |
|---|----------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Adopt CBR financial philosophy for SG/Send?** | Serverless company model, hypothesis-driven development, no fabricated projections | Yes -- it's the same architecture and the same founder |
| 2 | **Commission the 11-document investor materials suite?** | Alchemist proposes: business plan, 2 pitch decks, founder profile, competitive analysis, investment strategy, revenue model, runs-everywhere, investor categories, marketing strategy, briefing pack (done) | Prioritise and sequence |
| 3 | **~~Set SG/Send investment parameters?~~** | **DECIDED (21 Feb):** £300K for 20% at £1.5M post-money. GBP denomination. | **£300K / 20% / £1.5M** |
| 4 | **~~Determine SG/Send jurisdiction?~~** | **DECIDED (21 Feb):** UK-based company. SEIS/EIS applies — significant investor incentive retained. | **UK-based, SEIS/EIS eligible** |
| 5 | **Adopt "profitable by design" language?** | CBR website claims "each user generates positive margin from day one." Same applies to SG/Send's serverless model. Stronger than "no kill date." | Recommended yes |
