# v0.5.8 -- Debrief: Town Planner First Session

**Version:** v0.5.8
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Role:** Librarian (Town Planner team)
**Session:** Founding session of the Town Planner team; Alchemist role established
**Master index:** [v0.5.8 Master Index: Town Planner First Session](../../../../../town-planner/roles/librarian/reviews/26-02-21/v0.5.8__master-index__town-planner-first-session.md)

## 1. Executive Summary

The Town Planner team has been established as the project's third team, operating alongside Explorer and Villager. The Alchemist is its founding role -- responsible for transforming the team's technical output into materials that attract investment and fund the project's future.

This session produced:

1. **A complete materials inventory** -- 44 source documents catalogued across 6 categories (investor-facing, strategic, technical, security, traction, incidents)
2. **A currency assessment** -- 3 of 5 `for-ambassador/` investor materials are stale and need urgent updating to reflect the PKI milestone
3. **A gap analysis** -- 12 gaps identified (4 critical, 4 high, 4 medium), with the missing Accountant role and stale investor materials as the top blockers
4. **The Alchemist's task backlog** -- 5 workstreams, 21 tasks, all at `todo` status, ready for execution

**The key finding:** The raw materials for a compelling investor story are rich and genuine. 44 documents provide provenance for every investor-facing claim. The PKI milestone (investor-validated, technically demonstrated, independently reviewed) is the centrepiece. What is missing is the transmuted output -- the narratives, the updated briefing pack, the demo script, and the pipeline tracking. The Alchemist's first workstreams will close these gaps.

## 4. Key Findings

### The Gold Is Real

The source material audit confirms that the Alchemist's core principle holds: the technical achievement is genuinely impressive and well-documented. Key provenance chains:

| Investor Claim | Source Evidence |
|----------------|----------------|
| "We built browser-based PKI in days" | Historian milestone (20 Feb), QA verification, 92 Explorer commits |
| "Independent security review validated our crypto" | INC-002 (29 findings from 25-year veteran), quote: "foolproof... correct implementation" |
| "We handle security incidents in under 2 hours" | INC-003 (100 min hotfix), INC-004 (30 min containment) |
| "Our security posture is ahead of most Series A companies" | 54 security findings documented, classified, being addressed; DPO from day one |
| "One person producing the output of a full team" | 75+ documents, 18 roles (now 19 with Alchemist), 111+ tests, live product |
| "PKI is the killer feature investors asked for" | Business incident doc (v0.4.17): investor said exactly this |

### Currency Problem

3 of 5 `for-ambassador/` documents are stale:
- **Investors Today** (v0.4.4) -- describes pre-PKI product. PKI is now built.
- **Investors Coming Soon** (v0.4.4) -- promises PKI as future. PKI now exists.
- **Agentic Team Briefing** (v0.4.7) -- describes 2 teams. Now 3.

These are the documents most likely to be shared externally. Updating them is the Alchemist's highest-leverage first action.

### Accountant Blocker

The Alchemist cannot produce financial models, unit economics, or cost narratives without the Accountant role. This role has been in the Villager backlog since at least 19 Feb (3+ days). It blocks:
- Workstream-4, Task-17 (financial model for due diligence)
- Workstream-5, Task-21 (one-pager executive summary, which needs pricing)
- Any financial narrative for investors

---

## 5. Decisions (Resolved 21 Feb)

| # | Decision | Outcome | Action Taken |
|---|----------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | **Create Accountant role** | **YES** -- created in Town Planner team | `team/town-planner/roles/accountant/ROLE.md` created with ROLE.md and `.issues/workstream-financial.issues` (15 tasks across 4 workstreams) |
| 2 | **Prioritise investor briefing pack update** | **YES** -- agreed | Alchemist Workstream-1 Task-3 is first execution priority |
| 3 | **Branding: SG/Send vs SigSend** | **SG/Send for all written comms. SigSend is verbal/spoken only.** | Updated materials inventory (G9), master index. All written investor materials must use "SG/Send". |

---

## 6. What's Next for the Town Planner Team

### Immediate (Next Session)

1. **Alchemist executes Workstream-1** -- complete the materials audit (this master index provides the foundation), produce the updated investor briefing pack (Task-3), and incorporate the PKI and security milestones (Tasks 4-5)
2. **Begin Workstream-2** -- write the 5 core narratives (origin, market, technology, traction, vision), drawing from the 44 source documents catalogued here

### Near-Term (This Week)

3. **Workstream-3** -- set up investor pipeline tracking (pipeline.issues), create the B1 investor group folder, and prepare follow-up materials and demo script for the next investor meeting
4. **Request Accountant role creation** -- signal to Conductor that this blocks financial narrative work

### Medium-Term

5. **Workstream-4** -- begin due diligence readiness by indexing architecture and security documents into `library/alchemist/due-diligence/`
6. **Workstream-5** -- produce the investor-readable translations (PKI one-paragraph, security posture summary, executive one-pager)
