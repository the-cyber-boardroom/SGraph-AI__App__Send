# Debrief: Part-3 Briefs — Map and Analysis

**version** v0.5.13
**date** 21 Feb 2026
**from** Villager session (Librarian + Architect reading)
**type** Debrief — catalogue and dependency map of 12 v0.5.10 briefs

---

## Executive Summary

Part-3 delivers **12 documents** that collectively define the **Data Room product** and its supporting infrastructure. This is a major strategic pivot: SG/Send moves from "encrypted file transfer utility" to "data rooms as a product." The briefs cover architecture, product definition, developer specs, marketing, and a performance investigation.

**The single most important document is `v0.5.10__product-brief__data-rooms.md`** — it declares the data room as the core sellable product and frames everything else as supporting infrastructure.

## The 12 Documents at a Glance

| # | File | Type | Assigned To | Summary |
|---|------|------|-------------|---------|

## Four Theme Clusters

### Theme 1: Data Rooms — The Product (B1/D1)

**Priority: HIGHEST.** The investor demo (Group 2) drives this.

| Document | What It Defines |
|----------|----------------|
| Product Brief: Data Rooms | The product, the revenue model, the investor demo sequence |
| Architecture: GitHub-as-Store | How data rooms are stored (GitHub) and served (ephemeral EC2) |
| Architecture: Identity Spectrum | How users are identified and verified within data rooms |
| Dev Brief: Data Room UX | What the user sees and interacts with |
| Dev Brief: FastAPI EC2 Routes | How EC2 instances are managed programmatically |
| Brief: Secrets Manager | How deployment secrets are managed (dogfooding SG/Send) |

**Minimum Viable Demo** (from product brief):
1. Create a data room (GitHub repo + config)
2. Branded URL: `investor-x.send.sgraph.ai`
3. Add contacts to directory (investor personas)
4. Upload review documents
5. Investor visits URL, enters key, sees files
6. Investor sends a message back
7. (Stretch) Running on ephemeral EC2

### Theme 2: Agent Chat System

**Priority: HIGH.** Enables the human's daily workflow and the public team site.

| Document | What It Defines |
|----------|----------------|
| Architecture: Browser Pod | Service Worker secure enclave for API keys |
| Dev Brief: Admin Agent Chat | The chat page in admin panel |
| Brief: Agent Context Pages | GitHub Pages as the LLM context source |
| Brief: Team Site | Public-facing `team.send.sgraph.ai` |

**Build order**: Agent Context Pages (GH Pages) -> Browser Pod (SW) -> Admin Agent Chat -> Team Site

### Theme 3: Marketing

**Priority: B3/D3.** Should NOT block investor demo work.

| Document | What It Defines |
|----------|----------------|
| Brief: SSH Key Utility | Free browser-based SSH key generator |
| Brief: Team Site (also in Theme 2) | Top-of-funnel marketing asset |

### Theme 4: Performance Investigation

**Priority: Important but BLOCKED.**

| Document | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Investigation: Admin Panel Performance | Waiting for human guidance on `osbot-utils` performance testing utilities. Do not start. |

---

## Priority Summary

| Priority | Item | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| **B1/D1** | Investor data room demo (Group 2) | Requires Themes 1 + partially Theme 2 |
| **B2** | Agent chat system + team site | Enables daily workflow + marketing |
| **B3/D3** | SSH key utility + marketing campaign | Independent, can be built with spare capacity |
| **BLOCKED** | Admin panel performance investigation | Waiting for human guidance |

---

## Villager Team Relevance

These briefs are overwhelmingly **Explorer territory** — new features, new architecture, new product capabilities. Per Villager rules:

| Villager Action | Detail |
|-----------------|--------|
| **DO** catalogue and map (this document) | Done |
| **DO** note performance investigation (Theme 4) | Villager-relevant: performance, hardening |
| **DO** assess security implications of new routes | EC2 management routes need AppSec/GRC review |
| **DO NOT** implement data room features | Explorer territory |
| **DO NOT** build agent chat or browser pod | Explorer territory |
| **DO NOT** build SSH key utility | Explorer territory |

**The performance investigation** is the one brief that squarely fits Villager scope (performance optimization, root cause analysis). It's currently BLOCKED.

## Questions for the Human

| # | Question | Context |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | **Which team should implement the data room MVP?** The briefs are v0.5.10 (Explorer version range). Is this Explorer work, or are you asking the Villager to cross the line for the investor demo? | The Villager CLAUDE.md says "do NOT add features" — data rooms are a new feature |
| 2 | **What's the timeline for the Group 2 investor demo?** This determines whether the data room work is urgent or can be phased. | Product brief references "coming back to them with their own data room" |
| 3 | **Is the performance investigation unblocked?** Brief says BLOCKED waiting for osbot-utils guidance. Ready to proceed? | Investigation Brief, line 8 |
| 4 | **Should agent chat be prioritized alongside or after data rooms?** It's a separate track but the human uses it daily. | Could be built in parallel by a different session |
| 5 | **Should the Villager session continue with current v0.1.4 admin hardening, or pivot?** We just fixed the storage-browser and QR code issues. There may be more Villager-appropriate work on the existing admin console. | Depends on human's priorities for this session |

## Recommended Reading Order

For the human reviewing the 12 briefs:

1. **Start here**: [`product-brief__data-rooms`](../../briefs/02/21/part-3/v0.5.10__product-brief__data-rooms.md) — the product vision
2. **Architecture**: [`architecture__github-store-and-ephemeral-compute`](../../briefs/02/21/part-3/v0.5.10__architecture__github-store-and-ephemeral-compute.md) — how it's built
3. **User experience**: [`dev-brief__data-room-ux-and-fleet-management`](../../briefs/02/21/part-3/v0.5.10__dev-brief__data-room-ux-and-fleet-management.md) — what users see
4. **Infrastructure**: [`dev-brief__fastapi-ec2-management-routes`](../../briefs/02/21/part-3/v0.5.10__dev-brief__fastapi-ec2-management-routes.md) — the API layer
5. **Security model**: [`architecture__browser-pod`](../../briefs/02/21/part-3/v0.5.10__architecture__browser-pod.md) — browser-side secure enclave
6. **Agent system**: [`dev-brief__admin-agent-chat`](../../briefs/02/21/part-3/v0.5.10__dev-brief__admin-agent-chat.md) + [`brief__agent-context-pages-github-pages`](../../briefs/02/21/part-3/v0.5.10__brief__agent-context-pages-github-pages.md)
7. **Then the rest** in any order

## Key Architectural Decisions in These Briefs

| Decision | Brief | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Data room = GitHub repo | Product Brief, GitHub-as-Store | Fundamental product model. GitHub IS the source of truth. |
| Ephemeral EC2 compute | GitHub-as-Store | Data rooms spin up on demand, cost $0 when idle |
| No Terraform/CloudFormation | FastAPI EC2 Routes | All infra management via FastAPI API. osbot_aws wrappers only. |
| Browser Pod = Service Worker only | Browser Pod | No Web Worker needed. SW does interception + message API + persistence. |
| Client-side search only (for now) | Identity Spectrum | No server-side name search. Preserves zero-knowledge. |
| SG/Send as its own secrets manager | Secrets Manager | 2 env vars per Lambda instead of 20. Pennies vs $200/month. |
| Chrome AI as free default for public site | Team Site | Zero-cost visitor experience. No API keys needed. |
| Agent context via GitHub Pages GET | Agent Context Pages | One `context.md` per role. Cacheable. No auth. |
