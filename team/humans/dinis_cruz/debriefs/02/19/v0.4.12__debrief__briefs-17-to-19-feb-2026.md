# v0.4.12 — Debrief: Briefs 17–19 February 2026

**Version:** v0.4.12
**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Role:** Librarian
**Session:** Villager team
**Master index:** [`v0.4.12__master-index__villager-team-17-to-19-feb.md`](../../villager/roles/librarian/reviews/26-02-19/v0.4.12__master-index__villager-team-17-to-19-feb.md)

## 1. Executive Summary

Three days of briefs (20 documents) accumulated since the last Villager session on 16 Feb. An Explorer session on 17 Feb produced incident infrastructure (INC-002) and role activations, but no Villager work occurred. This debrief catches up all three days.

**The headline:** the project has shifted from "building the product" to "building the ecosystem around the product." The briefs introduce partner deployment packaging, operational runbooks, a visitor programme, a new Accountant role, and audience-specific marketing collateral — all while a P1 security incident (INC-002) remains in dispatched-but-not-executed state.

---

## 2. What the Human Communicated

### 17 Feb — The Incident Day

Two briefs. The first external security review triggered a P1 incident (INC-002):

- **User A** (Levente Simon) — security professional, conducted a full code review, delivered 29 findings. 0 critical/high, 3 P3 (must-fix), 8 P4-P5, 15 P6-P8, 3 non-vuln. Crypto confirmed sound.
- **User B** — beta tester, confirmed product works, requested 3 features (all already on roadmap).
- **Key validation quote** (User A): *"I can't tell you how many times I've needed something like this."*

Five `for-ambassador/` documents provide investor pitches (3 docs — today/coming-soon/future-vision), an accountants vertical pitch, and an agentic team setup explainer for external audiences.

### 18 Feb — The Ecosystem Day

Six briefs. Four voice memos became four dedicated documents:

1. **Accountant Role (#19)** — cost measurement, externality accounting (output costs X but consumes 5.8X systemwide), Wardley Map financial flows, compound value of infrastructure
2. **Encrypted Chat** — "shared encrypted notepad with file attachments," real-time upload visibility (Explorer-primary)
3. **Partner Ecosystem** — Apache 2.0 partner manifesto, one-click deployment packaging (PyPI, Docker, CloudFormation, Terraform, GCP), cloud partner programmes, CC BY licensing on all materials
4. **UX Observations** — post-encryption dead zone, QUICK SHARE vs SECURE SHARE redesign, feature flags via localStorage, SPA deep linking
5. **User A Interview Transcript** — Levente Simon's full interview. Quotable: *"I didn't need to think at all. It's like Google search: foolproof."*

**Cross-cutting theme from 18 Feb daily brief:** "The other party doesn't need anything installed" is the hook — convenience first, encryption second.

### 19 Feb — The Maturity Day

Seven briefs. Five voice memos (industry dinner + commute + morning):

1. **Industry Dinner Debrief** — tube stranger independently said *"So this is like Signal for the web, right?"* Business cards worked (6 distributed, recipients expressed intent to try). Dropbox encryption perception gap.
2. **Chaos Agent, Runbooks, Fire Drills** — P0–P10 runbooks needed, fire drill schedule (monthly/quarterly/annually), Chaos Agent as future role with unmet prerequisites
3. **Guest/Visitor Programme** — third category beyond Explorer/Villager. First visitor: Manuel. Needs `team/visitors/` with welcome letter, .claude.md, getting-started guides, challenges
4. **Post-Quantum Cryptography** — "harvest now, decrypt later" threat, PQC research brief (Explorer-primary, but Ambassador needs position statement)
5. **Surf Security Integration** — enterprise secure browser partnership concept (Explorer-primary)
6. **UI Bugs** — nav active state, drag-drop too large, test files, in-browser rendering, auto-upload, delete button (AppSec/DPO/GRC policy needed)

**Cross-cutting theme from 19 Feb daily brief:** product sells itself when people touch it — demo over pitch deck.

## 6. Recommended Reading Order

For Dinis — to review the Villager team's catch-up:

1. **This debrief** — you're reading it
2. [Master index](../../villager/roles/librarian/reviews/26-02-19/v0.4.12__master-index__villager-team-17-to-19-feb.md) — full catalogue with task dispatch table (Section 7)
3. [GRC risk analysis for Finding #1](../../roles/grc/reviews/26-02-17/v0.4.9__risk-analysis__finding-1-token-race-condition.md) — needs your sign-off on P5 reclassification
4. [GRC vulnerability classification framework](../../roles/grc/reviews/26-02-17/v0.4.9__vulnerability-classification-framework.md) — the P0–P10 scale the team will use going forward

---

## 7. What's Next

### Immediate (this session or next)

1. **GRC** — write P0 and P1 runbooks (highest-value Villager work right now)
2. **DevOps** — start deployment packaging (Dockerfile first, then CloudFormation)
3. **Ambassador** — review the 5 `for-ambassador/` documents and produce tagline strategy
4. **Conductor** — create Accountant ROLE.md and .issues
5. **Librarian** — create `team/visitors/` folder structure

### Blocked on Human

- Finding #1 sign-off
- Delete button policy direction
- Partner role structure decision

## 8. Cost-Effectiveness Assessment

The three-day gap between the last Villager session (16 Feb) and this catch-up has created a significant backlog. The most cost-effective path forward is:

1. **Do NOT try to process everything in one session** — 20 briefs across 28 tasks will exceed context limits
2. **Prioritise by deployment readiness** — runbooks and deployment packaging are the two items that move the project from "works in dev" to "production-ready"
3. **Ambassador work can run in parallel** — it's document review and writing, independent of engineering
4. **INC-002 Wave 1 belongs to the Explorer team** — the code fixes are in Explorer territory; the Villager's role is to prepare the deployment pipeline to receive those fixes
