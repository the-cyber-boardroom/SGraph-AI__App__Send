# v0.4.4 -- Debrief: Daily Brief 16 February 2026

**Version:** v0.4.4
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Role:** Librarian
**Session:** Explorer team
**Master index:** [`v0.4.4__master-index__daily-brief-16-feb.md`](../../../../roles/librarian/reviews/26-02-16/v0.4.4__master-index__daily-brief-16-feb.md)

## 1. Summary of What the Human Communicated

Dinis Cruz provided **6 documents** and a **design-brief subfolder** (3 documents) on 16 February 2026. The briefs are now team-specific, with separate Explorer and Villager daily briefs. This debrief focuses on the Explorer team perspective.

### 1.1 Explorer Daily Brief

**Source:** [`v0.4.4__daily-brief__explorer-team-16-feb-2026.md`](../../briefs/02/16/v0.4.4__daily-brief__explorer-team-16-feb-2026.md)

Five new concepts introduced, adding to (not replacing) yesterday's priorities:

1. **Interactive Encrypted Data Workflows** -- SG/Send evolves from a dumb pipe to an encrypted workflow platform. JSON data with UI schemas, encrypted round-trips, dynamic interactive UIs rendered client-side. The recipient sees forms, buttons, review interfaces -- not just raw files.

2. **Briefing Packs for Agents** -- curated context packages for parallel agent execution. One folder per pack (iron rule). Method streams: quote actual code, not descriptions. The Librarian and Architect build packs; contributing roles add addenda.

3. **Translator Role Awareness** -- a new Villager-exclusive role. The Explorer team cares because: (a) the interactive workflow Use Case 1 is the Translator's reviewer workflow, (b) client-side translation is an Explorer exploration, (c) the non-English market hypothesis affects i18n architecture decisions.

4. **DPO/AppSec/GRC Evidence Pack** -- collect real evidence of how security/privacy roles influenced decisions. 11 known examples. Produces two articles for publication. Runs in parallel with engineering.

5. **Daily Memo Workflow Process** -- formalised intake pipeline. Architect + Librarian always process first. A debrief document is produced (this document follows that workflow). Impacted roles update themselves. Human reviews the debrief.

**Continuing from yesterday:** UX bugs (items 1-12), SA dashboard foundation, upload/download resilience research.

### 1.2 Villager Daily Brief (Catalogued for Reference)

**Source:** [`v0.4.4__daily-brief__villager-team-16-feb-2026.md`](../../briefs/02/16/v0.4.4__daily-brief__villager-team-16-feb-2026.md)

The Villager team's priorities are production-focused:
- **Production environment setup** -- three subdomains (dev, QA, prod) with CloudFront + Route 53
- **CloudFront LETS pipeline** -- full step-by-step: raw ingestion, typed JSON, consolidation, temporal aggregation with finality tracking, archive/cleanup, event-driven automation
- **SA REST API** -- every pipeline step exposed as an API endpoint
- **Admin UI visualisation** -- digital twin, cache browser, traffic dashboard
- **User acquisition** -- beta programme workflow, marketing copy, physical invite cards, feedback platform research
- **Translator role launch** -- audit untranslated content, establish translation pipeline, glossary
- **Daily automated reports** -- Historian (technical) and Journalist (narrative) templates
- **Production change discipline** -- 7-step deployment workflow (identify, test first, plan, risk assess, migrate, deploy, verify)

### 1.3 Translator Role Definition

**Source:** [`v0.4.3__role-definition__translator.md`](../../briefs/02/16/v0.4.3__role-definition__translator.md)

The 18th role and first Villager-exclusive. Handles two types of translation:
- **Language translation**: en, pt-BR, pt-PT, Klingon (Easter egg). Human reviewer step is non-negotiable.
- **Audience translation**: same content reframed for developers, business stakeholders, end users, investors.

Three-phase evolution: (1) internal translation now, (2) scale to many languages for market entry, (3) customer-facing translation product with its own P&L. The corporate translation vision (per-entity brand voice profiles for subsidiaries and acquired companies) is a major enterprise differentiator.

### 1.4 Interactive Encrypted Data Workflows

**Source:** [`v0.4.4__explorer-brief__interactive-encrypted-data-workflows.md`](../../briefs/02/16/v0.4.4__explorer-brief__interactive-encrypted-data-workflows.md)

The central new exploration. Three use cases:
1. **Translation review** (most immediate) -- structured JSON with approve/edit/reject per string
2. **Client-side translation as product** -- recipient gets content in their language via WASM LLM or API
3. **General-purpose encrypted workflows** -- document approval, surveys, code review, data collection, multi-party approval

Requires a UI component library (13 components defined), security model (declarative schemas only, sandboxed renderer), and eventually LLM-generated UI schemas.

### 1.5 Briefing Packs for Agents

**Source:** [`v0.4.4__briefs__briefing-packs-for-agents.md`](../../briefs/02/16/v0.4.4__briefs__briefing-packs-for-agents.md)

Process definition for how to package work for parallel agent execution. Key principles:
- One folder per pack (iron rule, no exceptions)
- Minimum viable pack: BRIEF.md + .issues/tasks.issues
- Method streams: quote actual code with file paths and line numbers
- Reference summaries: reusable compressed context blocks (caching service, LETS, IFD, etc.)
- First pack to create: CloudFront log pipeline

### 1.6 DPO/AppSec/GRC Evidence Pack

**Source:** [`v0.4.4__briefs__dpo-appsec-grc-evidence-pack.md`](../../briefs/02/16/v0.4.4__briefs__dpo-appsec-grc-evidence-pack.md)

Research and publication task. 11 known evidence items provided (5 DPO, 4 AppSec, 2 GRC). Three phases: evidence collection, interviews, article production. Two articles: technical evidence report (Historian) and narrative article (Journalist). Does not block engineering.

### 1.7 Design Brief Subfolder

**Source:** [`design-brief/`](../../briefs/02/16/design-brief/)

Three documents from v0.3.5:
- **Brand & design guidelines** -- "SG/Send" as brand shorthand, product family system (SG/ prefix), slash as key brand element
- **Logo brief** -- purely typographic, slash is the hero, minimal, geometric, modern
- **Logo brief for ChatGPT** -- same direction, packaged for image generation context

## 4. Questions for the Human

### Clarification Needed

1. **Version numbering gap**: The previous master index was v0.3.0 (14 Feb). Today's briefs are v0.4.4. The 15 Feb debriefs reference v0.3.10, v0.3.12, v0.3.13. What drove the jump from v0.3.x to v0.4.x? Is there a v0.4.0-v0.4.3 set of documents we should be aware of, or did the version advance through work sessions that produced code rather than documents?

2. **Version inconsistency in today's documents**: Some documents are versioned v0.4.3 (Translator role definition, referenced in Explorer brief as `v0.4.3__explorer-brief__interactive-encrypted-data-workflows.md` and `v0.4.3__briefs__briefing-packs-for-agents.md` and `v0.4.3__briefs__dpo-appsec-grc-evidence-pack.md`), but the actual filenames on disk are v0.4.4 for some of these. The Explorer daily brief's "Documents Produced Today" table lists them as v0.4.3 but the files on disk are v0.4.4. Which version is canonical?

3. **CloudFront log pipeline ownership**: The briefing packs brief says the Librarian + Architect should create the CloudFront pipeline pack. But the CloudFront pipeline itself is Villager work (production SA). Should the Explorer team build the briefing pack for the Villager team to consume? Or does the Villager team build its own pack?

4. **Interactive workflow prototype scope**: The brief says "start with Use Case 1 (translation review)." Should the Dev prototype the full round-trip (sender creates structured JSON, encrypts, sends via SG/Send, recipient decrypts, sees interactive UI, responds, response encrypted and sent back)? Or just the rendering part (given a JSON schema, render an interactive UI)?

5. **Design brief subfolder**: The three design-brief documents are v0.3.5, while everything else today is v0.4.3/v0.4.4. Were these produced on a previous date and placed here for the Librarian to catalogue? Or are they new today?

6. **Explorer CLAUDE.md priorities**: The current explorer CLAUDE.md priorities are from v0.3.2 and reference design agency brief, Issues FS adoption, large file transfer research, etc. The v0.4.4 brief introduces substantially different priorities (interactive workflows, briefing packs). Should the Conductor update the explorer CLAUDE.md priorities completely, or keep the v0.3.2 items alongside the v0.4.4 additions?

---

## 5. What Teams Should Be Working on Next

### Explorer Team -- Confirmed Priorities

**Tier 1 (Start Immediately):**

1. **Daily memo workflow adoption** -- Conductor adds the workflow to `.claude/explorer/CLAUDE.md`. This is process infrastructure that improves everything else. (This debrief is the first execution of this workflow.)

2. **Interactive encrypted workflow prototype** -- Architect designs the UI component library; Dev begins a simple prototype (render a form from JSON schema, encrypted round-trip). This is the new strategic direction.

3. **First briefing pack (CloudFront log pipeline)** -- Librarian + Architect create the pack structure and template. This is a process improvement that accelerates all future parallel work.

**Tier 2 (Continue / Start Soon):**

4. **Continue yesterday's work** -- UX bugs, SA dashboard foundation, upload/download resilience. These are not superseded.

5. **AppSec schema security review** -- Start the security review of the interactive workflow schema model early, before heavy investment in implementation.

6. **DPO/AppSec/GRC evidence collection** -- Librarian + Historian begin searching documents. Runs in background.

7. **Reference summaries library** -- Librarian begins building compressed context blocks for reuse across briefing packs.

**Tier 3 (Research / Background):**

8. **LLM-generated UI schemas research** -- Can Claude/GPT reliably produce valid schemas?
9. **Client-side LLM translation research** -- WASM models, quality, performance
10. **Design/brand identity work** -- Logo generation, brand guidelines implementation

### Villager Team (Reference)

The Villager team should focus on: (1) three-environment production setup, (2) CloudFront LETS pipeline, (3) Translator role launch (website audit and translation), (4) SA REST API, (5) beta programme infrastructure.

---

## 6. Cost-Effectiveness Assessment

### What Is the Most Valuable Work Right Now?

**Highest value per token spent:**

1. **Daily memo workflow adoption** (Conductor) -- LOW COST, HIGH LEVERAGE. A 30-minute task that improves the efficiency of every future session. Do this first.

2. **Briefing pack template + first pack** (Librarian, Architect) -- MEDIUM COST, HIGH LEVERAGE. The CloudFront pipeline pack is the worked example that teaches us how to package work for parallel execution. Every subsequent pack gets faster. This is meta-work that multiplies productivity.

3. **Interactive workflow prototype** (Dev, Architect) -- MEDIUM COST, HIGH STRATEGIC VALUE. This is the new product vision. A simple prototype (render a form from JSON schema) validates the core concept. Start small -- don't over-engineer the first version.

4. **AppSec schema review** (AppSec) -- LOW COST, RISK REDUCTION. A focused security review before implementation investment prevents building on an insecure foundation. The declarative-only constraint (D039) needs validation.

5. **Continuing UX bugs and SA dashboard** (Dev) -- MEDIUM COST, DIRECT VALUE. These produce visible improvements to the existing product.

**Lower priority (defer if tokens are limited):**

6. **Evidence pack research** -- Valuable for external communication but doesn't improve the product. Run in background when capacity allows.

7. **Design/branding** -- Important for market positioning but can proceed independently and incrementally.

8. **LLM research tasks** -- Research that informs future work but has no immediate deliverable.

### Agents That Should NOT Be Active Right Now (Explorer Team)

- **Ambassador**: No immediate Explorer tasks. Villager territory (beta programme).
- **Sherpa**: No immediate tasks until SA pipeline produces data.
- **CISO**: No immediate Explorer tasks. Villager territory (production risk assessment).
- **Translator**: Villager-exclusive role.
- **GRC**: Minimal involvement (evidence pack contribution only, can wait).

### Agents That SHOULD Be Active (Explorer Team)

| Agent | What They Should Be Doing | Cost Estimate |
|-------|--------------------------|---------------|
| **Conductor** | Add daily memo workflow to .claude.md | Small (30 min) |
| **Librarian** | This debrief (done), then start briefing pack template | Medium (2-3 hours) |
| **Architect** | UI component library design, co-lead briefing pack | Medium (3-4 hours) |
| **Dev** | Interactive workflow prototype, method streams extraction | Medium (3-4 hours) |
| **AppSec** | Schema security review | Small (1-2 hours) |
| **Designer** | UI component visual design, logo generation | Medium (2-3 hours) |
| **Historian** | Begin evidence search (background) | Small (1 hour) |

---

## 7. Explorer CLAUDE.md -- Priority Updates Needed

The current `.claude/explorer/CLAUDE.md` priorities section (line 49-76) is from **v0.3.2** and is now outdated given the v0.4.4 briefs. Specifically:

### Current Priorities (v0.3.2) vs. New Direction (v0.4.4)

| v0.3.2 Priority | Status in v0.4.4 |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| P1: Design agency brief (logo, brand identity) | **Still active** but partially addressed -- design guidelines and logo briefs now exist in design-brief subfolder |
| P1: Design agency kickoff presentation | **Unclear** -- not mentioned in v0.4.4 briefs. May be superseded by direct logo generation |
| P1: Issues FS adoption | **Still active** -- briefing packs use .issues/ folders; Issues FS S3 adapter requested in Villager brief |
| P2: Large file transfer research | **Still active** -- upload/download resilience continues from 15 Feb |
| P2: Research: project-aware Claude bot | **Not mentioned** in v0.4.4. May be deprioritised |
| P2: Research: Slack/WhatsApp bot | **Not mentioned** in v0.4.4. May be deprioritised |
| P2: Landing page | **Not mentioned** in v0.4.4 Explorer brief. May have moved to Villager |
| P3: Evaluate unencrypted file transfer mode | **Not mentioned** in v0.4.4 |
| P3: Capture read receipts + multi-upload | **Not mentioned** in v0.4.4 |

### New Priorities Not In Current CLAUDE.md

| New Priority | From v0.4.4 |
|-------------|-------------|
| **P1**: Interactive encrypted data workflows (UI component library, prototype) | Explorer brief, Section 1 |
| **P1**: Briefing packs (CloudFront pipeline pack, template, reference summaries) | Explorer brief, Section 2 |
| **P1**: Daily memo workflow (add to .claude.md) | Explorer brief, Section 5 |
| **P2**: AppSec schema security review | Interactive workflows brief |
| **P2**: DPO/AppSec/GRC evidence collection | Evidence pack brief |
| **P2**: Translator awareness (i18n architecture implications) | Explorer brief, Section 3 |

### Recommended Updates

The Conductor should update `.claude/explorer/CLAUDE.md` to:

1. **Replace** the "Current Explorer Priorities" table with v0.4.4 priorities
2. **Add** the daily memo workflow process to the Explorer CLAUDE.md
3. **Update** "Components Still Being Explored" to add interactive encrypted workflows and briefing packs
4. **Update** "Key References" to point to the v0.4.4 briefs instead of v0.3.2/v0.3.0
5. **Update** the "Latest debrief" reference to point to this debrief
6. **Update** the "Master index" reference to point to the v0.4.4 master index

**NOTE:** This debrief identifies these updates but does NOT make the edits, per the task instructions. The Conductor should make these changes in the next session.

## 8. Recommended Reading Order

For Dinis Cruz -- to review the output of this Librarian session:

1. **This debrief** (you are here) -- the structured summary of everything
2. **Master index** -- [`v0.4.4__master-index__daily-brief-16-feb.md`](../../../../roles/librarian/reviews/26-02-16/v0.4.4__master-index__daily-brief-16-feb.md) -- the full catalogue with decision and risk registers
3. **Section 4 above** (Questions) -- 6 clarification questions that affect how the team proceeds
4. **Section 6 above** (Cost-effectiveness) -- which agents should be active and what they should work on

---

*This debrief was produced following the daily memo workflow defined in the Explorer daily brief (Section 5). The Librarian processed the briefs, catalogued all documents, produced this structured debrief, identified impacted roles and their specific tasks, raised clarification questions, and assessed cost-effectiveness. The Architect should review this debrief and add any architectural observations before the human reviews.*
