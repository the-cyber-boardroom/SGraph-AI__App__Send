## What Was Delivered

### 1. Admin Console UI (v0.1.0)

A fully functional admin console at `/admin/v0/v0.1/v0.1.0/`:

| File | Component | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `index.html` | Shell | Main page — three-section layout with navigation |
| `css/admin.css` | Styles | Dark theme, CSS custom properties, responsive |
| `js/admin-api.js` | API Client | AdminAPI class, cookie auth, error handling |
| `components/admin-shell/admin-shell.js` | `<admin-shell>` | Layout with sidebar nav, panel switching |
| `components/token-manager/token-manager.js` | `<token-manager>` | Token CRUD, list table, create form, revoke confirmation, auto-refresh |
| `components/analytics-dashboard/analytics-dashboard.js` | `<analytics-dashboard>` | Pulse display, configurable window, auto-refresh |
| `components/system-info/system-info.js` | `<system-info>` | Service info, routes list, health indicator |

**Architecture highlights:**
- Web Components with Shadow DOM (IFD compliant)
- CSS custom properties for theming (dark by default)
- Cookie-based auth (`credentials: 'include'`)
- XSS protection (`_escapeHtml` on all dynamic content)
- Loading states and error handling for all async operations
- Responsive layout (mobile-friendly)
- Auto-refresh on token list and analytics

### 2. Role Responses (10 documents)
