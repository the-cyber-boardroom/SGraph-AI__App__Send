# Debrief: osbot-* Audit & Frontend v0.1.4 Bump

**Version:** v0.2.41
**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Session:** osbot-* ecosystem audit (Dev + Architect), IFD version bump v0.1.3 → v0.1.4

---

## Executive Summary

Two deliverables this session:

1. **Dev + Architect reviews** auditing all osbot-* capabilities and the MGraph-AI cache service used by SGraph Send
2. **Frontend v0.1.4** created via IFD methodology (v0.1.3 is now locked, v0.1.0 untouched)

All 111 unit tests pass.

## What Was Delivered

### 1. Dev Review: osbot-* Capabilities & Cache Service Audit

- [Dev Review](../../../roles/dev/reviews/26-02-14/v0.2.41__review__osbot-capabilities-and-cache-service-audit.md)

Complete catalogue of every osbot-* feature we use:
- **osbot-utils:** Type_Safe (15+ classes), 10 Safe_* primitives, utilities (Env, Files, Json)
- **osbot-fast-api:** Fast_API__Routes (3 route classes), Service Registry (2 registrations), @route_path decorator, Routes__Set_Cookie, Client transport
- **osbot-fast-api-serverless:** Serverless__Fast_API (2 Lambdas), Routes__Info, Deploy__Serverless__Fast_API
- **osbot-aws:** S3 client (9 methods), aws_config, Lambda dependency loader
- **mgraph-ai-service-cache:** In-process FastAPI cache with temporal + key_based strategies
- **mgraph-ai-service-cache-client:** Cache__Service__Client via Service Registry IN_MEMORY mode

### 2. Architect Review: osbot-* Ecosystem Architecture Assessment

- [Architect Review](../../../roles/architect/reviews/26-02-14/v0.2.41__review__osbot-ecosystem-architecture-assessment.md)

Architectural assessment of the three pillars:
1. **Type_Safe as universal data model** — strengths, Safe primitive character-stripping risk, missing ISO timestamp type
2. **Service Registry as integration pattern** — IN_MEMORY/REMOTE mode analysis, shared process state risk, comparison with alternatives
3. **Memory-FS + Cache Service as storage abstraction** — S3 prefix separation, strategy usage, how it eliminated 25-35h of custom code

Includes coupling assessment (tight to osbot-utils, thin to osbot-aws and cache service) and five recommendations.

### 3. Frontend v0.1.4 (IFD Bump)

Per IFD methodology, v0.1.3 is now locked. New version created at `sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__user/v0/v0.1/v0.1.4/`:

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Config updated | `APP_SEND__UI__USER__LATEST__VERSION = "v0.1.4"` |
| Redirects updated | `/` and `/send` now redirect to `/send/v0/v0.1/v0.1.4/index.html` |
| Upload URLs | `buildCombinedUrl` and `buildLinkOnlyUrl` point to `v0.1.4/download.html` |
| Download "Send your own" | Points to `v0.1.4/index.html` |
| Version comments | JS file headers updated to v0.1.4 |
| v0.1.0 assets | **Untouched** — shared CSS, crypto.js, api-client.js remain in v0.1.0 |
| v0.1.3 | **Locked** — no files modified |
| Test updated | `test__App_Send__UI__User__static_pages.py` assertion updated to v0.1.4 |

## Recommended Reading Order

1. **Architect Review** (architecture-level view of the osbot ecosystem) — understand the three pillars
2. **Dev Review** (detailed catalogue) — see exactly which classes/methods are used where
3. The v0.1.4 changes are mechanical (IFD bump) — no review needed unless you want to spot-check

---

## Key Findings

### Strengths of the osbot Approach
- **Zero-mock testing** — Service Registry IN_MEMORY mode means tests run production code paths
- **Storage agnostic** — application code never sees boto3, S3 paths, or deployment topology
- **Type safety without Pydantic** — lighter, more predictable, Swagger-integrated

### Risks Identified
- **Safe_Str character stripping** — `Safe_Str__Id` silently strips `/`, `:`, `+`. Must choose the right Safe type per field.
- **No ISO timestamp Safe type** — forces bare `str` for ISO timestamp strings
- **Lambda package size** — cache service adds dependencies (measure in CI)

### Architect Recommendations

| # | Recommendation | Priority |
|---|---------------|----------|
| R1 | Request `Safe_Str__Iso_Timestamp` from osbot-utils | P2 |
| R2 | Document Safe primitive character-set constraints | P1 |
| R3 | Add cache service package size measurement to CI | P1 |
| R4 | Evaluate `TEMPORAL_LATEST` for health pulse | P3 |
| R5 | Add registry cleanup to test teardown | P2 |

## What's Next

- The v0.1.4 frontend is ready for new feature work (token integration UI, per the Dev brief from v0.2.41)
- The osbot audit provides a reference for any future Dev session adding new schemas or services
- Decision 3 from the 14-Feb brief (remove LaunchList script) was already done in v0.1.3 — the script is not present in v0.1.4

*Debrief complete. Two role reviews delivered, frontend bumped to v0.1.4, 111 tests passing.*
