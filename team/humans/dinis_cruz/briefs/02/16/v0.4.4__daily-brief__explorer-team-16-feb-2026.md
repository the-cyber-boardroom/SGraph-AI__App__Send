# Explorer Team: Daily Brief — 16 February 2026

**version** v0.4.4  
**date** 16 Feb 2026  
**from** Human (project lead)  
**to** Explorer team via Conductor  
**previous** `v0.3.10__daily-brief__explorer-team-15-feb-2026.md` (yesterday's brief — already acted on, do not modify)

## What's New Today

Three new concepts, one new process, and one cross-team research task. Yesterday's priorities (UX bugs, SA dashboard, upload/download resilience research) remain active — this brief adds to them, it doesn't replace them.

## 1. Interactive Encrypted Data Workflows

A major new exploration direction. Full brief: `v0.4.3__explorer-brief__interactive-encrypted-data-workflows.md`

**The insight**: SG/Send currently transfers opaque blobs — encrypted content goes in, encrypted content comes out. What if the recipient saw a form, a review interface, a set of buttons — dynamically generated from the content — all while the data remains encrypted on the client?

**JSON in → JSON out, via nice interfaces.** The sender structures data as JSON (with a UI schema), encrypts and sends it via SG/Send. The recipient decrypts on their device, the browser renders a dynamic interactive UI from the schema. The recipient interacts (approves, edits, fills in), the response is serialised back to JSON, encrypted, and sent back.

The server never sees the content, the form, or the response. It's just encrypted bytes through the pipe. The interactivity is entirely client-side.

**Three use cases explored in the brief:**
1. **Translation review** — the Translator sends structured translation strings to a human reviewer. The reviewer sees an approve/edit/reject interface per string. Corrections come back as structured JSON. This is the most immediate use case.
2. **Client-side translation as a product** — recipients receive content translated into their language via client-side LLM or API call. Translation as a paid feature with its own P&L.
3. **General-purpose encrypted workflows** — document approval, surveys, code review, data collection, multi-party approval, corporate translation review. All encrypted.

**The enterprise play**: corporate customers with subsidiaries and acquired companies can get content translated not just into languages, but into each entity's specific brand voice and cultural identity. Per-entity translation profiles. High-value enterprise pricing.

**What the Explorer team needs to do:**
- **Architect + Designer**: design the UI component library (the set of well-defined browser elements that schemas can reference)
- **Dev**: prototype rendering a simple form from a JSON schema with an encrypted round-trip
- **AppSec**: security review of the schema model — schemas must be declarative, never executable. Renderer must be sandboxed. Review for exfiltration risks.

## 2. Briefing Packs for Agents

Full brief: `v0.4.3__briefs__briefing-packs-for-agents.md`

**The concept**: curated, compressed packages of exactly the context an agent needs to execute a specific piece of work. Not everything. Not nothing. The RIGHT context.

This affects how we package work for parallel execution — multiple agents, each with their own pack, each isolated, each working on a different task simultaneously.

**Key principles:**
- Every pack lives in its own **dedicated folder** (the iron rule — no exceptions, even for the smallest bug)
- Minimum viable pack: the pack folder, a BRIEF.md, a `.issues/` folder, and a `tasks.issues` file
- Packs are zip-and-share friendly — drop a folder into any context and the agent has everything
- Code context uses **method streams** — actual code quoted with file paths and line numbers, not descriptions

**What the Explorer team needs to do:**
- **Librarian + Architect**: create the first full briefing pack (CloudFront log pipeline) as the worked example
- **Developer**: extract method streams for the relevant code paths
- **Librarian**: build the reference summary library (caching service, LETS, IFD, etc.)
- **AppSec + DPO**: write addendum for the CloudFront pack (confirm IP addresses not stored — empirical verification, not just config-level)

## 3. The Translator Role (Villager Team — But Explorer Needs to Know)

The Villager team has a new role: the **Translator**. This is the first Villager-exclusive role.

**Why the Explorer team cares:**
- The interactive encrypted data workflows (Use Case 1 above) are built for the Translator's human reviewer workflow
- The UI component library needs to support translation review interfaces
- Client-side translation as a product feature is an Explorer exploration

**Key detail from the Translator definition**: the non-English market hypothesis. There's likely a bigger market for secure file sharing in non-English-speaking countries (underserved markets, not saturated like English-speaking ones). Every language we add is a market we can enter. This should inform how the Explorer team thinks about internationalisation at the architecture level.

## 4. DPO/AppSec/GRC Evidence Pack (Cross-Team Task)

Brief: `v0.4.3__briefs__dpo-appsec-grc-evidence-pack.md`

The Librarian and Historian are collecting evidence of how DPO, AppSec, and GRC roles have added value to this project — real examples, real quotes, real influence on other roles' decisions. This produces articles for publication.

**Explorer team involvement:**
- **Librarian + Historian**: search all Explorer team documents for evidence (DPO/AppSec/GRC influence on decisions)
- **Journalist**: conduct quick interviews with impacted Explorer roles — "would you have made the same decision without this role present?"
- **Architect, Developer, DevOps**: you may be interviewed about specific decisions where security/privacy roles influenced your work

This runs in parallel — it doesn't block any engineering work.

## 5. Process Update: Daily Memo Workflow (Add to .claude.md)

**Action for Conductor**: add the following workflow to the Explorer team's `.claude.md` configuration file. This defines what happens every time the human provides a voice memo or daily brief.

### The Workflow

Every time the human provides a memo or brief:

1. **Architect + Librarian read first** — they are always the first to process any new input from the human.

2. **Librarian catalogues** — copies files where they need to go, updates cross-links, updates indexes, ensures nothing is lost or orphaned.

3. **They produce a debrief document** — a structured index of everything that was said, stored in the Librarian's domain. This debrief contains:
   - Summary of what the human communicated
   - Which roles/agents are impacted
   - Specific tasks or to-dos extracted for each impacted role
   - Questions for the human (anything ambiguous or needing clarification)
   - What teams should be working on next (if nothing new, confirm the existing priorities)

4. **Impacted roles update themselves** — every role mentioned or affected by the memo:
   - Updates their own `.issues` file with new tasks
   - Updates their own knowledge documents and internal guidance
   - Updates their `ROLE.md` if the memo changes their responsibilities
   - Adds roadmap items, future considerations, or notes as appropriate

5. **Human reviews the debrief** — the debrief is a "debrief on the brief." It shows the human:
   - How their input was consumed and understood
   - Whether anything was missed or misinterpreted
   - What questions the team has
   - What each team is working on next (with phases mapped by the Architect)
   - Cost-effectiveness assessment: is this the most valuable work to be doing right now?

6. **Clarifications flow back** — if the human answers questions or provides corrections, the cycle repeats (smaller this time).

### The Principle

Not every memo impacts every agent. If only one role is mentioned, only that role processes. But the Librarian and Architect ALWAYS process — they are the information routing layer.

### Cost-Effectiveness Check

The debrief should include an assessment: **what is the most cost-effective work each agent should be doing right now?** Not every agent needs to be active at all times. If an agent has no current tasks, they don't run. The Conductor manages this — spinning up agents when there's work, standing them down when there isn't.

## For the Conductor

Yesterday's priorities remain active:

- **UX bugs** (items 1–12 from yesterday's brief) — keep shipping fixes
- **Server Analytics foundation** (cache browser → Lambda views → CloudFront views) — keep building
- **Upload/download resilience research** — Architect and Dev should be progressing

Today adds:

- **Interactive encrypted workflows** — start with the UI component library design and a simple prototype. This feeds into the Translator's reviewer workflow (which the Villager team needs soon).
- **Briefing packs** — the Librarian and Architect should start building the CloudFront log pipeline pack as the first real example. This is a process improvement that makes everything else faster.
- **Daily memo workflow** — add to `.claude.md` immediately. From now on, every memo I provide follows this processing sequence.

The DPO/AppSec/GRC evidence collection runs in the background — it's a Librarian/Historian task that doesn't block engineering.

Let's keep building.
