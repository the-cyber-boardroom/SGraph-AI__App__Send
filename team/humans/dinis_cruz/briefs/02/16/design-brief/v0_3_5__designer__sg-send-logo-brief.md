# SG/Send — Logo Generation Brief


## Brand Context (Read This First)

**SG/Send** is a zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing product. Users encrypt files in their browser before upload — the server never sees the contents. Think "WeTransfer, but we literally cannot read your files."

The brand needs to feel: **modern, approachable, trustworthy, and technical without being intimidating.** It should communicate privacy and security through elegance, not through fortress/shield/padlock imagery.

**The product family:**
- `SG/Send` — file sharing (this product)
- `SG/Image` — image processing (future)
- `SG/Text` — text generation (future)
- Parent brand: `SG/`

**The slash (`/`) is the key brand element.** It separates the brand prefix `SG` from the product name. It should be visually prominent — it IS the logo mark.

## Design Direction

### What the Logo IS

- **Purely typographic** — the logo is the text `SG/Send`, not an icon with text
- **The slash is the hero** — it's visually distinct (different weight, colour, or treatment from the letters)
- **Minimal** — no decorative elements, no icons, no illustrations alongside the text
- **Geometric** — clean letterforms, precise spacing, mathematical feel
- **Modern** — could be a 2026 tech brand, not a 2015 startup

### What the Logo is NOT

- No padlocks, shields, keys, or lock icons
- No envelope or file folder imagery
- No cloud imagery
- No gradients on the letterforms (gradients on the slash only are acceptable)
- No 3D effects or skeuomorphism
- No decorative serifs or script fonts
- Not rounded/bubbly/playful — this is a security product, not a children's app
- Not aggressive/angular/military — this is approachable, not intimidating

## Logo Variants to Generate

Please generate each of the following as separate images:

### Variant 1: Full Lockup — Dark Background

**Prompt guidance:**
Create a typographic logo for "SG/Send" on a dark navy (#1A1A2E) background. The letters should be in a clean geometric sans-serif font, light grey (#E0E0E0). The forward slash should be in teal (#4ECDC4) and slightly heavier/bolder than the surrounding letters. The slash should be at approximately 75 degrees from horizontal (steeper than a normal slash). Clean, minimal, modern tech brand aesthetic. No icons, no decorative elements. The logo should feel premium and precise. High resolution, centred composition with generous whitespace around the mark.

### Variant 2: Full Lockup — Light Background

**Prompt guidance:**
Same typographic logo "SG/Send" but on a warm white (#F0F0F5) background. Letters in dark navy (#1A1A2E), slash in teal (#4ECDC4). Same font, same proportions. Clean and minimal.

### Variant 3: Icon Mark — `SG/` Only

**Prompt guidance:**
Create a compact square-format logo mark showing only "SG/" — the brand prefix with the teal slash. Dark navy background, light letters, teal slash. This should work as an app icon or social media avatar. Square format, the characters should fill the space with balanced padding. The slash is the visual focal point.

### Variant 4: Monogram — `S/` Favicon

**Prompt guidance:**
Create an extremely minimal logo mark showing only "S/" — for use as a favicon or very small icon. Square format, dark navy background, white "S" and teal "/" slash. The two characters should be tightly composed and legible even at small sizes. Think 32x32 pixels rendered large. Bold, geometric, unmistakable.

### Variant 5: Product Family — All Products

**Prompt guidance:**
Create a visual showing the product family system: four logos stacked or arranged in a grid, all using the same typographic style:
- SG/Send
- SG/Image
- SG/Text
- SG/Billing
Each on dark navy background, with light grey text and teal slash. This should demonstrate that the naming system is visually coherent and scalable. Clean layout, consistent spacing.

### Variant 6: Slash Exploration — Weight & Angle

**Prompt guidance:**
Create a design exploration sheet showing 6 variations of the "SG/Send" logo, each with a different treatment of the slash:
1. Slash same weight as letters, same colour
2. Slash heavier weight, teal colour
3. Slash with a subtle teal-to-white gradient
4. Slash as a thin hairline (lighter than letters)
5. Slash slightly rotated (more vertical, ~80°)
6. Slash with a small gap/break in the middle

All on dark navy background. Arrange in a 2×3 grid with labels. This is an exploration to find the strongest slash treatment.

### Variant 7: Logo in Context — Website Header

**Prompt guidance:**
Create a mockup of a website header/navigation bar showing the SG/Send logo in its natural habitat. Dark navy header bar, the "SG/Send" logo on the left, minimal navigation on the right (just text links: "How It Works", "About", "Upload"). Below the header, a hero section with the tagline "Your files, your keys, your privacy" in large text. Teal accent colour for interactive elements. Modern, minimal web design. The logo should feel perfectly at home in this context.

### Variant 8: Logo in Context — Mobile App Icon

**Prompt guidance:**
Create a mobile app icon (iOS/Android style, rounded square) using the `SG/` mark. Dark navy background with the "SG/" text centred — "SG" in white and "/" in teal. The icon should look premium and recognisable on a phone home screen. Show it at app-icon size on a phone home screen mockup if possible.

## Typography Guidance for the AI

When generating these logos, aim for a font style similar to:
- **DM Sans Bold** — geometric, clean, with open letterforms
- **Outfit** — modern geometric sans with slightly rounded terminals
- **Plus Jakarta Sans** — clean and contemporary
- **General direction:** geometric sans-serif, medium-to-bold weight, not condensed, not extended. Clean and precise but not cold.

**Do NOT use:**
- Inter (too generic)
- Helvetica (too corporate/dated)
- Futura (too retro)
- Roboto (too Google-associated)
- Any serif, slab-serif, or display/decorative font

## Evaluation Criteria

After generating, evaluate each logo against:

| Criterion | Weight | Question |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Distinctiveness** | High | Would you recognise this at a glance? |
| **Slash prominence** | High | Is the slash clearly the defining element? |
| **Scalability** | High | Does it work at favicon size (16×16)? |
| **Family coherence** | Medium | Does the system extend naturally to SG/Image, SG/Text? |
| **Approachability** | Medium | Does it feel welcoming, not intimidating? |
| **Professionalism** | Medium | Would an enterprise buyer trust this brand? |
| **Memorability** | Medium | After seeing it once, would you remember it? |
| **Colour balance** | Low | Is the teal accent effective without being overwhelming? |

---

## Iteration Guidance

After the first round, here are follow-up prompts to refine:

**If the slash needs more presence:**
"Make the forward slash larger, bolder, and more visually dominant. It should be the first thing your eye is drawn to. The slash IS the brand — make it unmissable."

**If it looks too corporate:**
"Make this feel more modern and approachable — like a product you'd share with friends, not an enterprise compliance tool. Warmer, more human, slightly less rigid."

**If it looks too casual:**
"Add more precision and technical confidence. This is a security product used by professionals. It should feel engineered, not hand-drawn."

**If the font doesn't work:**
"Try a more geometric sans-serif with wider letterforms and slightly rounded terminals. The 'S' and 'G' should feel open and modern, not closed and rigid."

**For colour variations:**
"Try the slash in these alternative accents: coral (#E94560), electric blue (#4A90D9), warm amber (#E0A84F). Show all four colour options side by side."

## Final Deliverables Expected

From this exercise, we want to end up with:

1. **One primary logo** (`SG/Send` on dark) — the definitive mark
2. **Light background variant** — same logo, inverted for light contexts
3. **Icon mark** (`SG/`) — for app icons, avatars, square formats
4. **Monogram** (`S/`) — for favicon, smallest sizes
5. **Family demonstration** — showing SG/Send, SG/Image, SG/Text together
6. **Usage mockup** — the logo in a realistic web header context

All as high-resolution images, ideally with transparent backgrounds where possible.
