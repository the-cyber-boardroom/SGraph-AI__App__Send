# Brief: Guest / Visitor Programme — Onboarding External Contributors

**version** v0.4.11  
**date** 19 Feb 2026  
**from** Human (project lead)  
**to** Librarian (lead), Advocate, Sherpa, Journalist, Historian  
**type** Programme brief — new contributor onboarding  

---

## The Concept

We already have Explorer and Villager team members. Now we need a third category: **Visitors** — people outside the project who want to learn about it, explore the repo, talk to the agents, and potentially contribute.

The first visitor is a user the human knows personally (referred to as "Manuel") who is willing to spend time with the platform, learn about the project, and provide feedback. But this programme should be designed to scale — every new person who clones the repo and wants to understand the project is a visitor.

The term "Visitor" is preferred over "Guest" — they're visiting the team, exploring the environment, and may or may not stay.

## What a Visitor Needs

### 1. A Welcome Letter

The first thing a visitor receives — a message the human can send via SG/Send, email, or any channel. It should:

- Welcome them to the project
- Explain what SG/Send is (one paragraph)
- Explain the team structure briefly (two teams, 19 roles, AI agents coordinated by a human)
- Set expectations (what they can do, what they'll find, how to communicate back)
- Provide clear first steps
- Be warm, not corporate — this is an invitation to explore, not a terms-of-service document

### 2. A Claude MD for Visitors

We already have `.claude.md` files for Explorer and Villager agents. We need one for Visitors:

```
team/
├── humans/
├── roles/          ← Explorer .claude.md
├── villager/       ← Villager .claude.md
└── visitors/       ← NEW: Visitor .claude.md
    └── .claude.md
```

The Visitor `.claude.md` should instruct an LLM:

- You are helping someone who is new to this project
- They don't know the architecture, the team structure, or the codebase
- Your job is to help them explore, understand, and engage
- Point them to key documents: role definitions, architecture briefs, the agentic workflow briefing
- Answer questions about the project using the repo contents
- Suggest things to explore ("Have you looked at how the encryption works?" / "Try reading the Cartographer's role definition")
- Be friendly, encouraging, and patient

### 3. Platform-Specific "Getting Started" Guides

Different visitors will have different tools. We need instructions for each:

| Platform | Instructions |
|---|---|
| **ChatGPT (free)** | Clone the repo locally. Upload key files to a ChatGPT conversation. Paste the visitor system prompt. Start exploring. |
| **ChatGPT (Plus/Pro)** | Use the Code Interpreter to clone the repo. Or upload a zip of key files. Paste the visitor system prompt. |
| **Claude (claude.ai)** | Upload key files to a Claude conversation. Paste the visitor system prompt. Start exploring. |
| **Claude Code (CLI)** | Clone the repo. Run Claude Code pointed at the repo directory. The .claude.md files will be picked up automatically. |
| **Claude Code Web** | Clone the repo into the session. The .claude.md files will be picked up automatically. |
| **Other LLMs** | Clone the repo. Provide the visitor system prompt and key files as context. |

**Key constraint**: the visitor doesn't need to commit back. They're read-only. The repo is public, so cloning is trivial. The question is: how do they get the repo contents into their LLM of choice?

**Developer + Advocate**: test each platform. Document what works, what doesn't, and what the friction points are. The human will personally verify.

### 4. "Talk to an Agent" Instructions

Visitors should be able to "talk to" specific agents by loading the appropriate role definition and context into their LLM session. Instructions for:

- **Talk to the Librarian**: "Load the Librarian role definition. Ask it to give you an overview of the project's knowledge base."
- **Talk to the Historian**: "Load the Historian role definition. Ask it to walk you through the project timeline."
- **Talk to the Cartographer**: "Load the Cartographer role definition. Ask it to explain the project's strategic positioning using Wardley mapping."
- **Talk to the Sherpa**: "Load the Sherpa role definition. Ask it about user feedback and what the community is saying."

Each "talk to" instruction should specify: which files to load, what system prompt to use, and some suggested opening questions.

### 5. Interview Briefs (for Manuel and Future Visitors)

When a visitor agrees to provide feedback, the Sherpa and Journalist should conduct a structured interview using ChatGPT voice mode (or similar). We need:

- **Interview brief for the LLM**: a system prompt that instructs the AI to conduct the interview — what questions to ask, what to probe on, how to keep the conversation natural
- **Topic areas**: what drew them to the project? What's their background? What did they find interesting? What was confusing? What would they use SG/Send for? How do they currently share sensitive files?
- **Output format**: the interview transcript should be processed by the Sherpa into user insights and by the Journalist into a potential story

### 6. Communication Back to Us

How do visitors send feedback, ideas, or contributions?

| Channel | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **SG/Send** | Available now | Visitor uses the product to send encrypted feedback. Eating our own cooking. |
| **GitHub Issues** | Available now | For technical feedback, bug reports, feature requests. Requires GitHub account. |
| **GitHub Discussions** | Could enable | For broader questions and conversations. Lower barrier than Issues. |
| **Email** | Available now | Simple but not encrypted. |
| **Dedicated feedback token** | On roadmap | A special SG/Send access token for visitor feedback. |

For Manuel specifically: set up a shared encryption key so he can send messages and files back via SG/Send with minimal friction.

### 7. Challenges and Easter Eggs

To make the exploration fun and engaging:

**Challenges** — structured tasks that guide the visitor through the repo:
- "Can you find out how many agent roles there are and name them all?"
- "Can you find the Translator role definition and explain why it only exists in the Villager team?"
- "Can you identify the three P3 findings from the security review?"
- "What's the human's preferred way of communicating with the agents?"
- "Can you find the user quote that best captures SG/Send's value proposition?"

**Easter eggs** — things you can only discover by asking the right questions or exploring deeply:
- Hidden references in documents
- Inside jokes in the role definitions
- The meta-story of how the project documents its own creation

The point: make it interactive, fun, and community-driven. Not a dry README but an exploration.

## The OpenAI GPT Question

The human asked: can we create a custom OpenAI GPT that visitors can talk to directly?

**The challenge**: GPTs have static knowledge. The repo changes daily. A GPT loaded with yesterday's files is already stale.

**Possible approaches**:

| Approach | Freshness | Complexity |
|---|---|---|
| **Static GPT** with periodic manual updates | Days stale | Low |
| **GPT with Actions** that fetches from GitHub API on each conversation | Real-time | Medium — requires a small API endpoint |
| **GPT instructions** that tell the user to clone the repo first, then paste key content | Always fresh | Low — but higher friction for the user |
| **GitHub-integrated GPT** using the official GitHub integration | Near real-time | Medium — depends on OpenAI's integration capabilities |

**Research task for Architect + Developer**: investigate whether an OpenAI GPT can be configured to pull from a GitHub repo at conversation start. If yes, this is the ideal solution — the GPT always has the latest content. If not, the "instructions to clone first" approach is the fallback.
