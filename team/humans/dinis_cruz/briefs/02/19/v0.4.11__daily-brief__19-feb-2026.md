## Overview

Today's input came from five voice memos recorded across the evening of 18 February (industry dinner and commute) and the morning of 19 February. Six dedicated briefs have been produced. This document links them and captures cross-cutting themes and orphan topics.

## Cross-Cutting Themes

### 1. The Product Sells Itself When People Touch It

Every encounter described in today's memos — the dinner conversations, the tube stranger, the upcoming visitor (Manuel) — follows the same pattern: the human shows or describes SG/Send, the other person tries it, and they immediately get it.

The tube stranger went from scepticism ("that's not very secure") to advocacy ("Signal for the web!") in under two minutes. The dinner attendees compared it to Dropbox and immediately understood the encryption advantage. The product doesn't need a slide deck — it needs someone to type a URL and press encrypt.

**Implication for the Ambassador**: our marketing strategy should be "get people to try it" not "explain what it does." The business cards, the demo workflow, the visitor programme — these all optimise for hands-on engagement over pitch decks.

### 2. The Browser Is the Platform

Three of today's briefs converge on the browser as the security boundary:

- **Post-quantum crypto** (Doc 2): can the browser handle PQC algorithms? What are the browser's cryptographic capabilities?
- **Surf Security** (Doc 5): a secure browser provides guarantees that a normal browser can't — DLP, screenshot prevention, key management, device posture
- **UI improvements** (Doc 4): in-browser rendering of images and PDFs, client-side file type detection, drag-and-drop between page elements

The browser is our entire runtime. We don't have a server-side application in the traditional sense. Every improvement — security, performance, UX — happens in the browser. This is both a constraint and a strength.

### 3. From Closed Team to Open Community

The visitor programme (Doc 3) marks a strategic shift. Until now, the project has been one human + AI agents. Opening it to visitors — people who clone the repo, talk to the agents, explore the knowledge base — is the beginning of community.

This connects to:
- **Partner ecosystem** (from yesterday's v0.4.10 briefs): partners deploy the product
- **Business cards** (Doc 1): every card creates a potential community member
- **The GitHub page** (Doc 1): the first thing external people see
- **Open source licence** (Apache 2.0 + CC BY): the legal foundation for community

### 4. Operational Maturity Acceleration

The runbooks and fire drills brief (Doc 6) represents a maturity jump. We're moving from "we have a product" to "we have a product with defined incident response procedures, severity classifications, and tested response capabilities."

This connects to the security review work (the P0–P10 framework already defined), the Accountant role (cost spikes as incidents), and the Chaos Agent concept (systematic resilience testing).

## Orphan Topics

### "How to Learn About What We're Doing" Page

The human described a scenario from the dinner: someone asks "What's a Wardley map?" and instead of explaining, the human says: "Clone this repo, point Claude Code at it, load the Cartographer role, and ask."

This is a powerful concept — the repo becomes a self-documenting learning resource. Anyone can talk to the project's knowledge base using their preferred LLM.

The Visitor programme (Doc 3) partially addresses this, but the human also wants a specific **public page** (on the docs site or README) that says:

> "Want to learn about this project? Clone the repo. Open your favourite AI assistant. Paste this prompt. Start asking questions."

**Journalist + Advocate**: create this page. Make it platform-specific (ChatGPT, Claude, Claude Code). Make it inviting. This is both documentation and marketing.

### Dropbox Encryption Verification

The human noted that a technical person at the dinner was surprised Dropbox isn't end-to-end encrypted. The human wants this verified and documented: what exactly is Dropbox's encryption model? Google Drive's? OneDrive's? Can these services read your files? Do their ToS allow content processing for AI training?

**AppSec + Ambassador**: this is research task from Doc 1, but flagging it here because it's a high-value messaging asset. If we can show a clear table — "Service X: provider holds keys. Service Y: provider holds keys. SG/Send: only you hold the key" — that's a powerful differentiator.

### The Designer Cards Workflow as a Template

The human noted that the business card workflow (brief Designer → SVG → local print → same-day distribution) is a validated pipeline. This isn't just about cards — it's a repeatable pattern for any physical marketing material: flyers, posters, conference handouts.

**Designer + Ambassador**: document this as a standard operating procedure. Include: preferred local printers, file format requirements, turnaround times, cost estimates.

### "Signal for the Web" and Tagline Strategy

The tube stranger's spontaneous "Signal for the web" comment is the strongest tagline we've received. But the human also noted we should drop "zero-knowledge" from non-technical materials — it sounds like hype.

**Ambassador**: develop an audience-segmented tagline strategy:

| Audience | Tagline |
|---|---|
| Security professionals | "Signal for the web" |
| Technical users | "End-to-end encrypted. No app required." |
| Business users | "Send files securely. Your recipient just needs a browser." |
| Elevator pitch | "Like Dropbox, but we can't see your files." |

Test all four. See which generates the most engagement in each context.

## For the Conductors

### Explorer Team Priorities

1. **Architect**: post-quantum crypto feasibility research (Doc 2), Surf Security API research (Doc 5), OpenAI GPT with live repo access (Doc 3)
2. **Developer**: fix broken GitHub images (P1), navigation active state bug (Doc 4), drag-drop area redesign, test file drag-and-drop, delete button implementation
3. **AppSec**: PQC assessment (Doc 2), Surf Security DLP and key storage research (Doc 5), delete button security review (Doc 4)
4. **GRC**: P0 "pull the plug" runbook (P1), P1 major incident runbook (P1), external security disclosure runbook, fire drill planning (Doc 6)

### Villager Team Priorities

1. **Designer**: non-technical card designs (Doc 1), drag-drop area redesign (Doc 4), document the print workflow as SOP
2. **Sherpa**: track card distribution engagement by access code (Doc 1), validate "Signal for the web" tagline
3. **Ambassador**: Dropbox/Google Drive/OneDrive encryption comparison (Doc 1), audience-segmented tagline strategy, Surf Security partnership concept (Doc 5)
4. **Journalist**: update GitHub README and project page (P1), "How to explore this project" public page, article: "Signal for the web — how a stranger on the tube named our product"
5. **Librarian**: create `team/visitors/` folder structure (Doc 3), Chaos Agent placeholder, cross-link today's documents
6. **Advocate**: visitor getting-started guides per platform (Doc 3), "Talk to an Agent" instructions
7. **Historian**: record milestones — first business cards distributed, first stranger encounter, "Signal for the web" moment

### New Items for the Role Registry

| Item | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Chaos Agent** | Future role | Placeholder created. Not active yet. Prerequisites: runbooks, monitoring, separate environments. |
| **Visitor** | New category | Not a role — a category of external participant. Folder structure and onboarding materials needed. |
