## What Happened

The human attended a cybersecurity industry dinner in Central London on the evening of 18 February. Multiple conversations about SG/Send took place with a mix of known contacts and new acquaintances. On the tube journey home, a stranger engaged with the product in real time after seeing the human reading project documents. Several significant validation data points emerged.

## The Business Cards Worked

The physical business cards designed yesterday by the Designer were printed same-day by a local printing company (Instant Print), collected, and distributed at the dinner. Six cards were handed out.

**The workflow that worked:**
1. Designer created the SVG design
2. Human emailed the SVG to the local printer
3. Same-day printing and collection
4. Cards distributed at the dinner
5. Each card had the URL, a handwritten access code on the back, and the tagline

**Observations:**
- People were genuinely curious — nobody gets physical cards anymore, which makes them stand out
- The card as an artefact creates a moment of engagement that a LinkedIn message doesn't
- Several recipients said they'd try it and provide feedback
- The workflow (brief Designer → SVG → print → distribute) is fast and repeatable

**Designer**: the current design works well for technical audiences (it was a cybersecurity dinner). We need a second batch of designs for non-technical users — less technical language, more approachable. Consider:
- A simpler tagline (see "Signal for the Web" below)
- Possibly a small visual showing the encryption flow (even a simple animation concept)
- Drop "zero-knowledge" from the non-technical cards — it sounds like hype to non-security people. Focus on privacy and simplicity instead.

**Ambassador**: the card distribution model is a repeatable user acquisition channel. The human plans to hand out cards at every opportunity — coffee shops, meetups, conferences, casual encounters. Each card has a unique access code, giving us rough tracking of which distribution context generates engagement. Document this as a formal channel in the acquisition playbook.

## "Signal for the Web" — A New Tagline

### The Tube Story

On the tube home, the human was reading daily brief documents on their phone. A stranger sitting next to them commented: "That's not very secure" (they could see security-related content on screen). The human replied: "It doesn't matter — everything you see here is open source."

This led to a conversation. The stranger works in AI and robotics — clearly technical. The human handed him a card. He:

1. Typed the URL into his phone
2. Opened the website
3. Navigated to the text area
4. Typed "hello world" with some emojis
5. Clicked encrypt
6. Saw the post-encryption page with the link and key
7. Immediately understood the two-channel model ("you send them separately")

And then he said:

**"So this is like Signal for the web, right?"**

This is significant. A technical user, seeing the product for the first time on a phone on the tube, independently arrived at the same framing. "Signal for the web" — or "Signal for the browser" — captures the value proposition in four words that a technical audience instantly understands:

- End-to-end encrypted ✓
- No app required ✓ (that's the "for the web" part — what Signal isn't)
- Simple to use ✓
- The other party doesn't need to install anything ✓

**Ambassador**: test "Signal for the web" as a tagline. It may not work for non-technical audiences (they may not know what Signal is), but for security-conscious people, it's immediately compelling. Consider audience-specific taglines:
- Technical: "Signal for the web"
- General: "Send anything securely. No app required."
- Business: "The secure way to share files. Your recipient just needs a browser."

### The Dropbox Perception Gap

The same stranger was "really surprised" when told that Dropbox isn't end-to-end encrypted. He had assumed it was. This is a common perception gap — even technical users assume that major cloud storage services encrypt data in a way that prevents the provider from reading it. They don't.

**Research task for Ambassador + AppSec**: verify and document the encryption models of major cloud storage and file sharing services (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud, Box). Specifically: does the provider hold the keys? Can the provider read your files? Do their terms of service allow them to process file content (e.g., for AI training)? This is powerful messaging material — not to attack competitors, but to educate users about what "encryption" actually means in practice.

## Dinner Conversations — Validation Points

### The Dropbox Analogy

Someone at the dinner compared SG/Send to Dropbox. The human's response: "Like Dropbox, but Dropbox can't see your files." This led to the encryption-at-rest discussion — "Oh, you encrypt on the browser, like SSL?" — "Yes, but the recipient decrypts, not us. We can't."

**Ambassador**: the Dropbox analogy is useful. People understand Dropbox. "Dropbox, but we can't see your files" is a one-sentence pitch.

### Agentic Team Interest

Multiple people at the dinner were curious about the agentic team model — how the 18 roles work, how voice memos become structured briefs, how one person produces the output of a team. This generated genuine interest and engagement.

**Ambassador + Journalist**: the agentic workflow story is a second product — it's a proof point for how AI changes software development. We should be telling this story alongside the product story. Every conversation about "how did you build this?" is an opportunity to demonstrate the team model.

## GitHub Page Needs Updating

The tube stranger was scrolling through the GitHub page during the conversation. The human observed that:

- There are **broken images** (likely from a previous design iteration)
- The README doesn't reflect the latest developments
- The page is a customer-facing surface — potential users and partners read it

**Journalist + Sherpa**: take ownership of the GitHub README and project page. This is a customer-facing document, not just a developer resource. It should be:
- Current (latest features, latest screenshots, latest architecture)
- Professional (no broken images, no stale content)
- Engaging (the agentic team story, the "Signal for the web" pitch)
- A gateway (clear "try it now" link, clear "deploy your own" link)

Treat the GitHub page with the same attention as the docs site. For many users, it's the first thing they see.

## The Beta Distribution Workflow Is Validated

The full workflow — from card design to card printing to card distribution to user engagement — worked end-to-end in a single day:

```
Designer creates SVG → Print locally (same day) → Distribute at event
→ User types URL → User tries product → User provides feedback
→ Access code on card provides rough attribution
```

The human plans to scale this: coffee shops, meetups, conferences, casual encounters. Every interaction is a potential user. Every card is a tracked experiment (different access codes for different contexts).

**Sherpa**: start tracking distribution contexts. Which environments generate the most engagement? Which taglines work? Which card designs get the best response? This is user acquisition analytics at the grassroots level.

**Ambassador**: the human's observation: "If every day I can meet some new users and give them cards, I start to generate traffic." This is the growth model — not paid advertising, not cold outreach, but personal distribution with physical artefacts that create engagement moments.
