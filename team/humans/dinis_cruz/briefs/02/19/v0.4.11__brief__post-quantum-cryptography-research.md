## The Question

At the industry dinner, someone asked: **"What about post-quantum?"**

The context: there are state-level actors and sophisticated organisations today that are harvesting encrypted data with the intention of decrypting it once quantum computers are powerful enough. This is the "harvest now, decrypt later" threat model. If someone captures the encrypted blobs stored on our S3 backend today, could they decrypt them in 5–10 years using a quantum computer?

The human's answer at the dinner: "I don't have a good answer yet. Let me ask my agentic team to look into it."

This is that research task.

## What We Need to Answer

### Primary Question

**Can we implement post-quantum resistant encryption in the browser in 2026?**

Specifically:
- Which post-quantum cryptographic algorithms are available today?
- Are any of them implemented in the Web Crypto API? (Almost certainly not yet — but check.)
- Are there JavaScript or WebAssembly (WASM) implementations of post-quantum algorithms that run in the browser?
- What's the performance cost? (Key generation time, encryption time, decryption time, ciphertext size)
- What's the storage cost? (PQC ciphertexts and keys are significantly larger than classical ones)
- What's the computational cost? (Does this require WASM, or can pure JS handle it?)

### Secondary Questions

- Which PQC algorithms has NIST standardised or recommended? (CRYSTALS-Kyber for key encapsulation, CRYSTALS-Dilithium for signatures — verify current status in 2026)
- Is there a hybrid approach? (Use both AES-256-GCM as we do today AND a PQC algorithm — belt and braces. If quantum breaks AES, the PQC layer protects. If PQC has a flaw, AES still protects.)
- What do other browser-based encryption tools do about PQC? (Signal has implemented the PQXDH protocol — what's their approach?)
- Is there a timeline concern? (When does "harvest now, decrypt later" become a real threat for our use case vs a theoretical one?)

### The Business Question

**How can we have a credible story for the post-quantum question?**

This doesn't necessarily mean we implement PQC tomorrow. Options:

1. **"We're aware and tracking"** — acknowledge the threat, explain our current encryption (AES-256-GCM is quantum-resistant for symmetric encryption; the risk is more around key exchange if we add asymmetric crypto like PKI), describe our roadmap
2. **"Hybrid mode available"** — implement PQC as an optional layer on top of AES-256-GCM for customers who need it (banking, financial regulation)
3. **"PQC by default"** — replace or augment the current encryption with PQC algorithms for all users

Option 2 is likely the right answer for 2026 — available for those who need it, not forced on those who don't (given the performance overhead).

## Important Nuance: AES-256-GCM and Quantum

Our current symmetric encryption (AES-256-GCM with 256-bit keys) is actually relatively quantum-resistant. Grover's algorithm reduces the effective key strength by half — meaning AES-256 becomes effectively AES-128 against a quantum attacker. AES-128 is still considered secure.

**The real PQC risk for SG/Send is when we add asymmetric cryptography** — PKI, public/private key pairs, key exchange protocols. RSA and ECC (the classical asymmetric algorithms) are completely broken by Shor's algorithm. If we implement PKI (on our roadmap), we MUST use PQC algorithms for that component.

So the research should address two scenarios:
1. **Current architecture (symmetric only)**: how quantum-resistant is AES-256-GCM? (Answer: reasonably good, but research the latest.)
2. **Future architecture (with PKI)**: what PQC key encapsulation and signature algorithms are available for browser use?

## Regulatory Context

The human noted that post-quantum is "an interesting requirement from some banking and financial regulation environments." This is correct — certain financial regulations are starting to require quantum-readiness plans:

- NIST has published PQC standards
- European regulators (ENISA) have published guidance on quantum-safe cryptography
- Financial institutions are being asked about their PQC migration plans

Having a credible PQC story is a competitive advantage for the enterprise and financial services verticals, even if we don't implement it immediately.
