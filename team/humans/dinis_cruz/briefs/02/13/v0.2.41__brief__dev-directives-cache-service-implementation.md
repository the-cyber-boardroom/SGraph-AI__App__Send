# v0.2.41 — Brief: Dev Directives for Cache Service Implementation

**Version:** v0.2.41
**Date:** 13 February 2026
**From:** Dinis Cruz
**To:** Dev role
**Context:** Response to [Dev's cache service architecture response (v0.2.40)](../../../roles/dev/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.40__review__cache-service-architecture-response.md), specifically the open items and implementation plan.

---

## 1. Admin Authentication Pattern (Q5 — RESOLVED)

**Decision:** Use the default `osbot-fast-api` authentication for the admin Lambda.

The user Lambda explicitly disables this with `enable_api_key = False` in [`Fast_API__SGraph__App__Send__User.setup()`](../../../../sgraph_ai_app_send/lambda__user/fast_api/Fast_API__SGraph__App__Send__User.py). The admin Lambda should keep the default auth enabled — do **not** set `enable_api_key = False` on the admin service.

This resolves Q5 from the v0.2.33 implementation plan and the remaining open item from v0.2.40. No separate admin token needed for now — the framework's built-in API key auth is sufficient.

## 2. Dev Independence — No Pairing Needed

The cache service brief and the existing reference materials (`Html_Cache__Client.py`, client how-to, LLM brief) provide everything the Dev needs. The Dev should proceed independently with Phase 1 implementation.

I will review what is created. No need to wait for pairing sessions or further input from me on the implementation details.

## 3. No Raw Primitives or Collections — Anywhere

**This is a standing rule for all code in this project.**

The Dev must **not** use raw Python primitives (`str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`) or raw collections (`dict`, `list`, `set`) in any class fields, schema definitions, or Type_Safe classes. This applies to:

- All new cache service code (`Send__Cache__Client`, schemas, analytics, tokens)
- All new FastAPI route handlers and response models
- Any existing code touched during this sprint

Use the appropriate `Type_Safe` primitives and typed collections from `osbot-utils` instead. See [DEV-010](../../../roles/dev/.issues/DEV-010__replace-raw-primitives-in-schemas.md) for the mapping pattern already documented for `Schema__Transfer`.

This is not optional. Every `str` should be a `Safe_Str` (or domain-specific variant), every `int` should be a `Safe_Int` / `Safe_UInt`, every `dict` should be a typed `Type_Safe` class, every `list` should use the appropriate typed collection.

## Summary of Directives

| # | Directive | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Admin auth: use default osbot-fast-api auth (keep `enable_api_key` default) | **Decision final** |
| 2 | Dev proceeds independently, Dinis reviews output | **Acknowledged** |
| 3 | Zero raw primitives/collections in all code | **Standing rule, mandatory** |
