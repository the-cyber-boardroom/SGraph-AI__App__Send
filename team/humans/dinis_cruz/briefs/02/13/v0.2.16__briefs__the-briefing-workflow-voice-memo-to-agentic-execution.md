# The Briefing Workflow: From Voice Memo to Agentic Execution

## What This Is

This document describes the end-to-end workflow we've developed for how a human project lead communicates with, directs, and receives deliverables from a multi-role agentic team. It covers the full cycle: from a brain dump in a voice memo to refined briefs, to parallel agent execution, to a consolidated debrief with links to all work produced.

The workflow solves a fundamental problem in agentic teamwork: **how do you maintain human direction and oversight of a team of AI agents working in parallel, without becoming the bottleneck, and without losing track of what's happening?**

The answer turns out to be a symmetrical system: briefs flow down, debriefs flow up, and a clear folder structure makes everything findable.

## Phase 1: Capture — Voice Memo to Transcription

### The Brain Dump

The workflow starts with a voice memo. This is deliberately unstructured — a stream-of-consciousness brain dump where the human project lead talks through:

- What they want the team to focus on
- Ideas and decisions they've been thinking about
- Feedback from real-world interactions (user testing, stakeholder conversations)
- Technical direction and architectural decisions
- Priorities and sequencing guidance

The voice memo doesn't need to be organised, polished, or complete. It's a raw capture of thinking — the kind of thing you'd say in a walk-around conversation with your team, not what you'd write in a formal document.

### Transcription

The voice memo is transcribed by Otter.ai (or similar transcription service). The transcription is rough — it includes false starts, filler words, speaker misattributions, and the natural messiness of spoken language. That's fine. The next step handles the cleanup.

**Why voice, not text?** Voice is faster, captures more nuance, and allows the human to think out loud. A 12-minute voice memo can contain the equivalent of a 3,000-word brief. Writing that brief directly would take significantly longer, and the process of writing often filters out the tangential ideas that turn out to be valuable.

---

## Phase 2: Refine — Claude Thread as the Translation Layer

### First Pass: Transcription to Coherent Document

The raw transcription is given to a Claude thread that has context on the project — it understands the roles, the architecture, the terminology, the history of decisions, and the human's communication style.

Claude's job in this phase is translation, not invention:

- Extract the ideas, decisions, and directions from the messy transcription
- Organise them into a coherent structure with clear sections
- Preserve the human's voice, logic, and priorities (this is critical — the brief should sound like the human, not like Claude)
- Flag any ambiguities or contradictions for the human to resolve
- Add structure that makes the brief actionable: task tables, role assignments, priority levels, dependency notes

The output is a first-draft brief that's already 80–90% of the way to the final version. The heavy lifting — extracting signal from noise, imposing structure, maintaining voice — is done in this step.

### Why a Dedicated Claude Thread?

The refinement thread is long-running and accumulates context over time. It knows:

- The project's role definitions and who does what
- Previous briefs and the decisions they contained
- The naming conventions and document versioning scheme
- The human's communication style and preferences
- The technical architecture and terminology

This accumulated context means each new transcription is processed with full project awareness. Claude doesn't just clean up the text — it connects it to the existing body of work, cross-references previous decisions, and structures the brief in a way that's consistent with everything that came before.

### Fine-Tuning: Surgical Edits

The human reviews the first draft and makes targeted adjustments. This is where Claude's ability to make precise, surgical edits to existing documents is valuable — add a section here, rephrase this paragraph, add this priority that I forgot to mention, restructure this task table.

The fine-tuning is conversational and fast. The human might say "add the multilingual and themes priorities from previous briefs" and Claude adds a complete section with role assignments and task breakdowns, consistent with the style of the rest of the document.

The result: a polished brief that reads as if the human wrote it thoughtfully over an hour, but was actually produced in 15–20 minutes (voice memo + refinement + fine-tuning).

---

## Phase 3: Commit — Brief Enters the Repo

### The File

The brief is saved as a markdown file with a versioned, descriptive filename:

```
team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/13/v0.2.32__daily-brief__1__sgraph-send-13-feb-2026.md
```

The naming convention carries meaning:
- `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/` — the human's briefing area
- `02/13/` — temporal folder (month/day)
- `v0.2.32` — the project version
- `daily-brief__1` — the brief type and sequence number
- `sgraph-send-13-feb-2026` — descriptive identifier

### The Commit

The file is committed to GitHub on the development branch. This is important — the brief is now a versioned, tracked, permanent part of the project record. It's not a Slack message that scrolls away or a meeting note that gets lost. It's a document in the repo, with a commit hash, that anyone (human or agent) can reference at any time.

---

## Phase 4: Execute — Claude Code Web Orchestrates

### The Trigger

The human goes to Claude Code Web (the master agent session that manages the project) and says:

> "Please read this brief and act on it."

That's it. One sentence. The master agent takes it from here.

### The Master Agent

Claude Code Web reads the brief and understands what's being asked. It identifies:

- Which roles are implicated (from the role assignments in the brief)
- What tasks need to be performed
- What the priorities and dependencies are
- What outputs are expected

### Parallel Subagent Execution

The master agent spawns a subagent for each relevant role. Each subagent:

1. **Reads the brief** from the perspective of their specific role
2. **Produces a response** — this might include:
   - Analysis and recommendations from their domain perspective
   - Questions or concerns about items relevant to their role
   - Initial work products (design proposals, security reviews, task breakdowns, etc.)
   - Identification of dependencies on other roles
3. **Writes their response** to a file in their own role's area in the repo:

```
team/roles/architect/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.32__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md
team/roles/appsec/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.32__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md
team/roles/dpo/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.32__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md
...
```

The subagents work in parallel. The architect isn't waiting for the dev to finish. The CISO isn't waiting for the DevOps. Each role processes the brief independently, from their own perspective, and produces their own output.

### What the Roles Actually Do

Each role's response is shaped by their role definition (their ROLE.md file). The architect responds to architecture-relevant items. The DPO flags data protection concerns. The AppSec reviews security implications. The journalist identifies content that needs to be written. The advocate evaluates user impact.

This means a single brief produces a multi-perspective analysis — the same decisions and directions are evaluated simultaneously through every relevant lens. Issues that would normally surface weeks later ("did anyone check the data protection implications?") surface immediately, because the DPO was in the room from the start.

---

## Phase 5: Consolidate — The Debrief

### The Problem It Solves

After the subagents complete their work, the outputs are scattered across the repo — each role has written their response in their own area. For the human, finding and reading all of these individually is impractical. Which files are new? Which are relevant? Which should be read first?

### The Debrief Pattern

The master agent (or the librarian role) creates a **debrief** — a single consolidated document that:

- Summarises what each role produced
- Links to every individual role response (using relative links that work in the GitHub browser)
- Highlights key findings, concerns, and decisions that need human attention
- Provides a reading order (what to look at first, what's optional context)

The debrief is placed in the human's own area, mirroring the temporal structure of the briefs:

```
team/humans/dinis_cruz/
  briefs/02/13/   ← human writes these (input)
  debriefs/02/13/ ← team writes these (output)
```

The symmetry is deliberate:
- **Briefs** are top-down: human → team
- **Debriefs** are bottom-up: team → human

### How the Human Consumes It

The master agent provides the human with a GitHub link to the debrief. The human:

1. Opens the debrief in GitHub's markdown renderer
2. Reads the summary — gets the high-level picture in 2 minutes
3. Follows the relative links to individual role responses for anything that needs deeper review
4. Identifies follow-ups, corrections, or new directions
5. Captures those in the next voice memo → the cycle repeats

### The Debrief as Archive

Over time, the debriefs folder becomes a chronological record of every batch of work the team has produced, with links to all the underlying materials. The human can go back to any date and see: what brief did I give? What did the team produce? What were the key findings?

This is the project's institutional memory — not in someone's head, not in a chat log, but in versioned, linked, browsable documents.

## Why This Works

### Speed

A 12-minute voice memo becomes a polished brief in 15–20 minutes. The brief triggers parallel execution across 15+ roles simultaneously. Within an hour or two, the human has a consolidated debrief with multi-perspective analysis of every decision and direction in the original voice memo.

In a traditional team, this cycle would take days — a meeting to brief the team, individual work sessions, a follow-up meeting to collect responses, someone synthesising the results. Here, it's measured in minutes to hours.

### Preservation of Human Voice

The brief reads like the human wrote it, because Claude is translating voice to text, not generating ideas. The human's priorities, logic, tangential insights, and communication style are preserved. The agents respond to the human's actual thinking, not a sanitised summary.

### Parallel Multi-Perspective Analysis

Every role evaluates the brief simultaneously. The architect thinks about system design while the DPO thinks about data protection while the AppSec thinks about security while the advocate thinks about user impact. Issues that would normally surface sequentially ("we built it, then realised it had a privacy problem") surface in parallel ("the DPO flagged the privacy issue before anyone wrote a line of code").

### Traceability

Everything is in the repo. Every brief, every role response, every debrief. Versioned, committed, with commit hashes. There's a complete audit trail of: what the human asked for, how each role interpreted it, what they produced, and what the human decided next.

### The Human Stays in Control Without Being the Bottleneck

The human sets direction (briefs), reviews output (debriefs), and makes decisions (follow-up briefs). They don't attend standups. They don't read every file. They don't coordinate between roles. The master agent handles orchestration. The debrief handles consolidation. The human's time is spent on the highest-value activities: thinking, deciding, and directing.

### Institutional Memory

The brief/debrief archive is the project's memory. Anyone (human or agent) joining the project can read the chronological sequence of briefs and debriefs to understand: what was decided, why, what the team produced, and how thinking evolved over time. This is richer and more useful than meeting minutes, because it includes the actual work products, not just summaries of discussions.

                 NEXT CYCLE BEGINS
                (new voice memo)
```

What makes this powerful isn't any single step — it's the cycle. Each iteration is fast (minutes to hours, not days to weeks), produces traceable artefacts (not conversations that disappear), and builds on everything that came before (accumulated context in the Claude thread, in the repo, in the role definitions).

The more cycles you run, the better it gets. The Claude thread understands the project more deeply. The role definitions get richer. The brief/debrief archive provides more context for future decisions. The agents produce better work because they have more history to draw on.

It's a flywheel. And it's just getting started.
