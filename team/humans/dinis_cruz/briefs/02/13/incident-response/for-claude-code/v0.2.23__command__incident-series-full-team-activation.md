## What Just Happened

I've completed a 5-part series on incident handling philosophy and practice. These documents define how this team detects, investigates, responds to, and learns from incidents. They are all in the project folder alongside the other v0.2.16 documents:

1. `v0.2.16__briefs__incident-philosophy-p3-as-p1.md` — **The P3-as-P1 Philosophy**: why "what could have happened" matters more than "what happened." The strategic case for treating minor incidents as major investigations. Near-miss analysis, second stories, the paths not taken, calibrating to real threat actors.

2. `v0.2.16__briefs__incident-practice-running-p3-as-p1.md` — **Running P3-as-P1 in Practice**: the operational playbook. What triggers a P3-as-P1, how to assemble the team, the 7-step process (declare → assemble → situate → investigate → assess runbooks → document → close), Issues FS as the incident backbone, and the maturity model where incidents become events.

3. `v0.2.16__briefs__incident-payoff-best-time-to-fix-things.md` — **Incidents as the Best Time to Fix Things**: the 5x productivity multiplier. Why incidents produce more improvement in 2 weeks than normal operations produce in 2 months. What gets fixed during incidents (observability, runbooks, dashboards, knowledge, architecture, tests). The "how many times before?" question. Every role as a security sensor.

4. `v0.2.16__briefs__incident-simulation-communication-escalation.md` — **First, Do No Harm**: simulation before action (using the world model to predict consequences of response actions), personalised multi-audience stakeholder communication (one incident → many briefings), escalation mapping (the 2am question), organic framework integration (MITRE ATT&CK, NIST, ISO — expand one incident at a time), and third-story systemic weaknesses.

5. `v0.2.16__briefs__incident-football-team-practice-and-preparation.md` — **The Football Team**: why practice makes real incidents look like exercises. The preparation spectrum (unprepared → practised → operationalised → automated). Planning for readjustment, not fixed outcomes. Creative incident storytelling. The cultural capstone for the series.

## What I Need You To Do

### Phase 1: Read and Catalogue

**Librarian**: catalogue all 5 documents as a series. Create the reading guide — which roles must read which documents, in what order. My recommendation:

- **All roles**: must read docs 1, 2, and 5 (philosophy, playbook, culture)
- **CISO, GRC, DPO, AppSec**: must read all 5
- **Conductor, DevOps, Journalist, Historian**: must read all 5
- **All other roles**: must read docs 1, 2, 5; should read 3 and 4 for context

Cross-reference with the existing tabletop exercise workstream from `v0.2.16__briefs__dpo-observability-tabletop-synthetic-users-playwright.md` — the incident series defines the philosophy and process that the tabletop exercise will test.

### Phase 2: Every Role Updates Their ROLE.md

This is the critical step. **Every role** must:

1. Read all 5 incident handling documents
2. Add a new section at the end of their `ROLE.md` file titled `## Incident Response` (or similar — keep it consistent across roles)
3. In that section, capture — in that role's own voice and from that role's perspective:
   - **How this role participates in incidents** — what's expected of them during a P3-as-P1 or a real P1 (drawn from the assembly model in doc 2 and the "For the Agents" sections across all 5 docs)
   - **What this role watches for** — the weak signals, the "how come this was possible?" triggers that are specific to this role's domain (drawn from the security sensor concept in doc 3)
   - **What this role produces during an incident** — the specific outputs and artefacts (log extracts, briefings, timeline entries, blast radius maps, test cases, framework mappings, etc.)
   - **What this role learns from incidents** — how incident findings feed back into this role's normal work (improvement backlog items, updated runbooks, new monitoring, new tests, etc.)
   - **How this role moves incident types rightward on the preparation spectrum** — what does it look like when this role's domain moves from "unprepared" to "practised" to "operationalised" to "automated" (drawn from doc 5)

This is important: the section should be written by each role as if they've internalised the philosophy, not as if they're summarising someone else's document. The advocate's incident section should sound like the advocate. The dev's should sound like the dev. The journalist's should sound like the journalist. Each role should connect the incident philosophy to their specific domain and responsibilities.

The purpose: when an incident occurs and a role is activated, the first thing the agent does is re-read its own ROLE.md. The incident response section needs to be there, in the role's own terms, so the agent immediately knows what's expected of it.

### Phase 3: Task Extraction

**Conductor + CISO**: review all 5 documents together and extract every actionable task from the "For the Agents" sections. There are tasks for every role across the series. Create proper issues for each, linked to the relevant document and assigned to the relevant role.

Key tasks to ensure are captured:

- **CISO**: develop the P3-as-P1 trigger framework, the "do no harm" pre-action checklist, and the cross-incident pattern analysis methodology
- **Conductor**: design the escalation graph (trigger conditions, notification chains, timeouts, acknowledgement protocols), define the assembly process, track the preparation spectrum for each incident type
- **DevOps**: inventory what data can be produced on demand (and how fast), build automated triage capability, build monitoring templates for common alerting patterns
- **Journalist**: develop multi-audience briefing templates, develop the incident-as-news-story format, establish the cadence for status updates during active incidents
- **Historian**: define the timeline format, establish the incident register, build the cross-incident comparison capability
- **Librarian**: build the incident library with indexing by trigger type, severity, roles involved, framework connections, and gaps found
- **GRC**: own the organic framework mapping expansion (MITRE ATT&CK, NIST CSF, ISO 27001 — one incident at a time)
- **DPO**: prepare ICO notification templates and data subject notification templates, ready to customise per incident
- **AppSec**: establish the systemic weakness register (third-story findings that recur across incidents)
- **Cartographer**: prepare blast radius and incident visualisation templates
- **QA**: establish the incident-derived test tracking (tests created from real incidents vs normal development)
- **Advocate**: define the user-impact assessment template for incidents
- **Ambassador**: define the process for turning resolved incidents into trust-building market content
- **Sherpa**: build the trail query capability — "show me all user behaviour for the last N hours at this flow stage"
- **Architect**: work with cartographer on the world model for pre-action simulation
- **Dev**: no specific new task beyond reading and updating ROLE.md, but the "how come no test failed when I changed this?" instinct should be embedded
- **Designer**: the "how come the user can reach this state?" instinct should be embedded

### Phase 4: Link to Tabletop Exercise

The tabletop exercise (total AWS compromise) from the earlier brief is the first real test of this incident philosophy. Ensure the tabletop is planned and executed in accordance with the process defined in doc 2, using the Issues FS backbone, the assembly model, the full-envelope analysis, and the "how many times before?" question.

The CISO leads. The conductor coordinates. Every role participates as defined in their updated ROLE.md incident response section.

### Phase 5: Journalist Coverage

**Journalist**: this 5-part series is itself a story worth covering. Write an article introducing the incident handling philosophy to the team — not a summary of all 5 docs, but the key message: "we treat minor incidents as major investigations because that's how we build the operational capability to handle real emergencies. Here's what changes for you."

Then, as ROLE.md updates come in from each role, the journalist should review them for consistency and highlight any gaps or misunderstandings — are the roles genuinely internalising the philosophy, or just parroting it?

## The Key Instruction

The most important outcome of this briefing is the ROLE.md updates. Every role needs to carry their incident response understanding in their own definition file — not as a reference to an external document, but as internalised knowledge written in their own voice.

When an incident hits and an agent reads its ROLE.md, the incident response section should tell it exactly:
- What to watch for
- What to do when activated
- What to produce
- What to learn
- How to make it better next time

That's the muscle memory. That's the training. That's how the football team knows what to do on match day.

Let's go.
