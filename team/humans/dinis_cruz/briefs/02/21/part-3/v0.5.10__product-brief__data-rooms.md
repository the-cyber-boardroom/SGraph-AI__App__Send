# Data Room Product Brief

**version** v0.5.10  
**date** 21 Feb 2026  
**from** Human (project lead)  
**to** All teams — Ambassador (lead), Sherpa, Architect, Developer, DevOps, Designer, Accountant  
**type** Product brief — the data room as the core product  

---

## Context

The PKI MVP is built, deployed, and working. That milestone triggered the version upgrade to v0.5. We now have the foundational capability — public/private key pairs in the browser, encrypt/decrypt working, key management UI — to build the product that customers actually buy.

**That product is the data room.**

## What Is a Data Room

A data room is a secure, branded, ephemeral environment where parties exchange documents, messages, and information under cryptographic access control.

The use case that triggered this: an investor sent the human documents to review for a potential deal. The human wants to come back to them **with their own data room** — a branded SG/Send environment where both parties can securely exchange documents, see each other's files, and communicate. This is the same use case the first investor group described (sending NDAs and term sheets to founders), now validated by a second independent investor.

A data room is:

- **A GitHub repo** containing configuration, directory, branding, and persistent data
- **An SG/Send instance** that serves the data room UI with the repo's configuration
- **Ephemeral compute** that spins up on demand and shuts down when idle
- **PKI-secured** — users authenticate with their keys, content is encrypted, access is revocable

---

## The Data Room Is What We Sell

The GitHub repo IS the product. When a customer buys SG/Send, what they get is:

| Billable Unit | What It Is |
|---|---|
| **The repo** | A GitHub repository containing all configuration, branding, directory, persistent data. This is the durable asset. It's version-controlled, auditable, and the customer owns it. |
| **Compute** | Ephemeral EC2 instances that serve the data room. Billed per-use (hours running) or per-access (spin up on demand). Costs only when active. |
| **Storage** | Encrypted ephemeral storage (S3) for transferred files. TTL-based — data expires. Billed by volume and retention period. |
| **The fleet manager** | The admin interface for creating and managing multiple data rooms. This is the management plane. |

### Revenue Model Implications

For the Accountant and Ambassador:

- **Per data room**: monthly fee for the repo + configuration + DNS entry + branding
- **Per compute hour**: metered billing for ephemeral EC2 time (only when data room is active)
- **Per transfer**: metered billing for encrypted file storage (S3, TTL-based)
- **Per seat**: optional — charge per user in the data room directory
- **Marketplace**: one-click deployment from AWS/GCP marketplace (connects to v0.4.10 partner ecosystem brief)

The investor demo should make this pricing model tangible: "Here's YOUR data room. It costs X per month. It spun up in 30 seconds. When you're not using it, it costs nothing."

## The Two Investor Demos

We now have two investor groups, both with the same use case:

| Investor Group | Status | Demo Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Group 1** (from v0.4.12) | Follow-up meeting to be scheduled | PKI demo, Claude skill prototype, architecture document |
| **Group 2** (new, v0.5.10) | Active — sent documents to review | Their own data room — end-to-end: create room, add contacts, upload files, recipient accesses files, messaging |

**For Group 2, the deliverable is their own working data room.** This is the most powerful sales tool possible — not a demo of a product, but the product itself, configured for them, with their documents in it.

### Minimum Viable Demo

| Step | What Happens | What It Shows |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Human creates a data room (GitHub repo + config) | The product creation workflow |
| 2 | Data room gets a branded URL: `investor-x.send.sgraph.ai` | Custom branding, professional presentation |
| 3 | Human adds contacts to the directory (investor's personas) | Multi-user PKI, persona management |
| 4 | Human uploads the review documents to the data room | Encrypted file storage, the core use case |
| 5 | Investor visits their URL, enters their data room key | The user experience — simple, clean, secure |
| 6 | Investor sees the directory, the files, can download/view them | File visualizers (PDF, markdown, images), the data room working |
| 7 | Investor sends a message back via the data room | Two-way encrypted communication, inbox/chat |
| 8 | (Stretch) The data room is running on an ephemeral EC2 instance | The infrastructure story — spins up on demand, costs nothing when idle |

Step 8 (EC2 instance) can be prepared in parallel by DevOps, even if not fully automated. Showing a live EC2 instance serving the data room, even if manually provisioned, is powerful.

## Personas in the Data Room

Each data room has a directory of personas. A persona is a public key + metadata, stored in the GitHub repo as a JSON file:

```json
{
  "persona_id": "dinis-cruz-boardroom",
  "display_name": "Dinis Cruz",
  "type": "boardroom",
  "properties": {
    "role": "Board Observer",
    "company": "Investor Group X"
  },
  "social": {
    "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/diniscruz"
  },
  "public_key_ref": "keys/dinis-cruz-boardroom.pub"
}
```

A single person can have **multiple personas** in the same data room or across data rooms:

- "Dinis Cruz — Board Observer" (for board communications)
- "Dinis Cruz — Reviewer" (for document review)
- "Dinis Cruz — Personal" (for general secure messaging)

**Agents also get personas.** If a data room includes an AI agent (e.g., a support agent, or one of the project's 19 roles), the agent gets its own key pair. Users can send messages that only the agent can decrypt. The human creates the key pair and adds the agent's public key to the directory under a profile.

## Data Room Directory as Company Directory

The directory in a data room naturally becomes a company directory. A company's data room repo contains:

- All employee personas (name, role, public key)
- Organisational structure (teams, departments — expressed as directory groupings)
- Revocation is natural: employee leaves → persona removed from directory → next sync to S3 removes their access

This connects directly to the trust graph architecture (v0.4.12) — the directory IS a trust graph, stored as JSON in a GitHub repo, synced encrypted to S3.

The directory also enables key discovery (v0.4.12 key discovery brief). Instead of looking up a key by a short code on the SG/Send server, you look it up in the data room's directory. The directory IS the registry, scoped to the data room.

## For the Ambassador and Alchemist

The data room is the product. The GitHub repo is what customers buy. This needs to be front and centre in all positioning:

- **Sales pitch**: "We create a secure data room for your team. You own it — it's a GitHub repo. We provide the encryption, the access control, the ephemeral compute. When you don't need it, it costs nothing."
- **Differentiation**: "Unlike Dropbox or Google Drive, we can't see your files. Unlike email, access is revocable. Unlike other data rooms (Intralinks, Datasite), you own the infrastructure and it runs on demand."
- **For the investor meeting**: "Here's your data room. We built it for you. Your documents are in it. Try it."
