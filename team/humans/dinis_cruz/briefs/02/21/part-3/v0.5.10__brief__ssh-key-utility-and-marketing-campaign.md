## Part 1: The Utility Page

### What to Build

A free, public, static page that generates SSH key pairs (public + private) in the browser using the Web Crypto API. The user can download both keys. No server interaction. No authentication required. No data leaves the browser.

**This is a completely separate codebase from the PKI key management page.** The PKI page uses `extractable: false` (private key can never be read). This utility uses `extractable: true` (private key is shown to the user and downloadable). Different security model, different purpose, different code.

### Where It Lives

The page is deployed in **two locations**:

| Location | Access | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **User Lambda** (e.g., `send.sgraph.ai/tools/ssh-keygen`) | Anonymous — no API key, no login, no authentication | Public-facing utility. The SEO/marketing target. Anyone can use it. |
| **Admin Lambda** (e.g., `/admin/tools/ssh-keygen.html`) | Admin access | Convenience utility for admins who need to generate keys for EC2, GitHub, etc. |

**Both serve the same static page.** There are no server-side methods. The page is purely client-side HTML + JavaScript. The Lambda just serves the static file.

### For GRC and AppSec

**Map the risk of anonymous access on the user Lambda.** Specifically:

| Risk | Analysis Needed |
|---|---|
| Abuse / DDoS | The page is static. No server computation. No database calls. Risk is standard for any static page — CDN-level rate limiting is sufficient. |
| Reputation | We're serving a crypto utility to anonymous users. Could someone claim we helped generate keys used for malicious purposes? Assess the liability. |
| Key generation quality | Are browser-generated keys as secure as OpenSSH-generated keys? Document any differences. |
| Data collection | We store nothing. No analytics? No cookies? Confirm the zero-data-collection posture and whether we want basic anonymous analytics (page views only). |
| Code integrity | If the page is served from our Lambda, a compromise could serve a modified page that generates weak keys or exfiltrates them. SRI (Subresource Integrity) and the Service Worker trust model (v0.4.12) apply here. |

### Technical Notes

**Web Crypto API for SSH keys**: the Web Crypto API can generate Ed25519 and RSA keys, but its export format is SPKI/PKCS8, not OpenSSH format. The page needs to convert:

- Private key: PKCS8 DER → OpenSSH PEM format (`-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`)
- Public key: SPKI → OpenSSH one-line format (`ssh-ed25519 AAAA...`)

Libraries that handle this conversion in the browser:
- `sshpk` (npm) — can convert between formats
- Custom implementation — the OpenSSH format is documented and not complex

Alternatively, use a pure-JS implementation like `tweetnacl` for Ed25519 key generation (bypassing Web Crypto) and format the output directly in OpenSSH format. This may be simpler than converting from Web Crypto's format.

**No server-side code.** The entire page is a single HTML file with inline JavaScript. No API calls. No fetch. No XMLHttpRequest. The page works offline once loaded.

## Part 2: First Marketing Campaign

### The Concept

This free utility page is SG/Send's first marketing asset. The goal: show up in search results for common SSH key generation queries, drive traffic to the page, and convert some visitors to SG/Send users.

### Target Queries

| Query | Monthly Search Volume (estimated) | Competition |
|---|---|---|
| "generate ssh key" | High | Medium — existing tools (ssh-keygen, PuTTYgen) dominate |
| "create ssh key for github" | High | Medium — GitHub's own docs rank well |
| "ssh key generator online" | Medium | Low — few good browser-based tools exist |
| "create ssh key in browser" | Low-Medium | Very low — almost no one does this well |
| "generate ed25519 key online" | Low | Very low — niche, high-intent |

### Why This Can Work

Most existing solutions require:
- Command-line knowledge (`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email"`)
- Installing PuTTY (Windows)
- Following multi-step GitHub docs

A clean, one-click, in-browser tool with clear "how to use" instructions is genuinely useful. The differentiator: **"nothing leaves your browser"** — a privacy/security angle that resonates with the target audience (developers, sysadmins, security-conscious users).

### The Ambassador's Mission

**Run this as an incident.** This is the first marketing campaign. We have no marketing infrastructure, no metrics, no existing content, no SEO baseline. That's an incident — something unexpected that requires assembling a team, assessing the situation, and executing.

The Ambassador should:

1. **Recruit help from the security team** — they know incident management. Apply the same discipline: assess, classify, assign, track, communicate, debrief.

2. **Research** (before building):
   - What are the top-ranking pages for these queries today?
   - What do they do well? What do they do poorly?
   - Where can we be genuinely better?
   - What channels can we promote on? (Hacker News, Reddit r/programming, Dev.to, Twitter/X, LinkedIn)
   - Can we get the page listed on "awesome" lists or developer tool roundups?

3. **Measure** (define metrics before launch):
   - Page views (anonymous — no user tracking, just count)
   - Click-through to SG/Send main page
   - Conversion (visitor → SG/Send user) if trackable without invasive analytics
   - Search ranking position for target queries (track weekly)
   - Backlinks generated

4. **Improve the website** — this campaign will expose gaps in the main website (messaging, positioning, CTAs). Use this as the forcing function to fix them.

5. **Make it LLM-friendly** — ensure the page content is structured so that LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) can recommend it when users ask "how to generate an SSH key." Include structured data, clear descriptions, and clean HTML semantics.

## Priority Classification

| Axis | Rating | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Business (B)** | B3 | First marketing initiative. Not revenue-critical today, but builds the pipeline. |
| **Security (P)** | P7 | Low security relevance. Anonymous access risk needs assessment but is standard. |
| **Development (D)** | D3 | Small effort (one static page), high leverage. |

### Conflict of Interest: Investor Demo vs Marketing

The human flagged that there's now a resource conflict between the investor data room work and this marketing initiative. This is the first instance of needing the formal priority framework:

- **Investor data room** (B1/D1) — higher priority, direct revenue opportunity
- **SSH key utility** (B3/D3) — lower priority, long-term pipeline building

The SSH key utility should not block investor demo work. It can be built by any developer with spare capacity, or by the Ambassador + a design-focused agent. The page is simple enough to build in a day.

**Each outreach agent should maintain their own priority table** (what are MY B1s, D1s, P1s?) which feeds into a master priority table managed via Issues-FS. This gives visibility into competing demands and enables rational resource allocation.

| # | Criterion |
|---|---|
| 1 | Page generates Ed25519 key pairs in the browser |
| 2 | Page generates RSA 4096 key pairs in the browser |
| 3 | Private key is downloadable in OpenSSH format |
| 4 | Public key is downloadable in OpenSSH format |
| 5 | Copy-to-clipboard works for both keys |
| 6 | Page makes zero network requests after initial load |
| 7 | Page is accessible at anonymous URL on user Lambda |
| 8 | Page is accessible on admin Lambda |
| 9 | "How to use" instructions are clear for GitHub and server use cases |
| 10 | GRC/AppSec risk assessment for anonymous access is documented |
| 11 | Ambassador has research document on target queries and competition |
