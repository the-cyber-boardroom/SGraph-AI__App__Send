# Brief: team.send.sgraph.ai — Public Agent Meeting Room

**version** v0.5.10  
**date** 21 Feb 2026  
**from** Human (project lead)  
**to** Ambassador (lead), Developer, Journalist, Librarian, Designer  
**type** Product + marketing brief — public-facing team site  

---

## What to Build

A public static website at `team.send.sgraph.ai` where anyone can meet, read about, and talk to the project's 19 agents. Fully client-side. No server. No authentication required. All data loaded dynamically from GitHub Pages.

This is three things at once:

1. **The human's daily tool** — a place to talk to agents, get updates, check status
2. **A marketing asset** — carries the SG/Send brand, showcases the agentic workflow, drives traffic
3. **An open-source community hub** — contributors can talk to the dev, understand the architecture, find where to help

---

## Why This Matters

The human is already getting traction by sharing raw GitHub links to role definitions. People try it, find it powerful. But a raw GitHub repo is not a product. `team.send.sgraph.ai` turns the workflow into a branded, accessible, shareable experience.

For someone who wants to:
- **Understand the architecture** → talk to the Architect
- **Know the security model** → talk to AppSec
- **Contribute a PR** → talk to the Developer about what's needed
- **See the latest news** → talk to the Journalist
- **Understand the business model** → talk to the Ambassador or Accountant

They go to one URL, pick an agent, and start talking. No setup. No install. No account.

## LLM Provider Strategy for Public Access

Visitors don't have API keys. The site needs to work without requiring one.

| Provider | Visitor Experience | Cost to Us |
|---|---|---|
| **Chrome AI (Gemini Nano)** | Works immediately in Chrome Canary. No API key. Runs locally in browser. | Zero |
| **Ollama** | Works if visitor has Ollama running locally. | Zero |
| **Visitor's own API key** | Visitor enters their Anthropic/OpenAI/OpenRouter key. Stored in browser pod (never sent to our servers). | Zero |
| **Our API key (budgeted)** | We provide a limited free tier via our pod — N free messages per visitor per day. | Our cost, capped by budget |

### Default flow:

```
1. Visitor arrives → check for Chrome AI availability
   ├── Chrome AI available → use it (free, instant, no setup)
   └── Chrome AI not available →
       2. Show options:
          ├── "Use your own API key" → pod stores it, full access
          ├── "Try with Ollama" → if localhost:11434 responds, use it
          └── "Free preview (limited)" → our budgeted key, N messages/day
```

The free preview tier is optional and budget-controlled. The human can decide whether to offer it based on cost. Even without it, Chrome AI provides a zero-cost option for Chrome users, and "bring your own key" works for everyone else.

## Technical Architecture

### Fully Static, Fully Client-Side

```
team.send.sgraph.ai
│
├── Hosted on: GitHub Pages (via Jekyll CI pipeline)
├── DNS: CNAME to {org}.github.io
├── Server-side code: NONE
├── Authentication: NONE (public site)
├── Data source: GitHub Pages (same repo, fetched via GET)
│
├── index.html          ← Meeting room (agent grid, latest updates)
├── {role}/index.html   ← Per-agent chat page (19 pages)
├── assets/
│   ├── sg-send.js      ← Client helper library (pod, agent helpers)
│   ├── pod-sw.js       ← Service Worker (browser pod)
│   └── style.css
│
└── Content loaded dynamically:
    ├── roles/{role}/context.md    ← Agent context (from Librarian's GH Pages)
    ├── project/introduction.md    ← Project preamble
    └── project/priorities.md      ← Current status
```

**No build step for content updates.** When the Librarian updates a `context.md` or adds a new brief, the site automatically serves the latest version on the next page load (GitHub Pages CDN, short cache TTL).

The Jekyll pipeline generates the HTML structure (agent cards, navigation, layout). The content (agent context, briefs, status) is fetched dynamically at runtime via `fetch()`.

### Reusing `sg-send.js`

The same client helper library from the browser pod brief powers this site. The public site and the admin panel share the same `sg-send.js` and `pod-sw.js`. The only difference is the admin panel has additional pages (fleet management, secrets, PKI). The agent chat capability is identical.

```javascript
// On team.send.sgraph.ai, a visitor can open the console and:
await ask__architect("explain the trust graph architecture")
await ask__appsec("what's the threat model for the browser pod?")

// Or use the chat UI, which calls the same functions under the hood
```

## Content Strategy

### For the Journalist

This site is a content distribution channel. Every brief, architecture decision, and status update becomes content that agents can discuss. The Journalist should:

- Write summaries of key architectural decisions (accessible to non-technical visitors)
- Publish "what's new" updates when versions change
- Create "featured conversations" — curated examples of interesting agent chats that demonstrate the workflow

### For the Ambassador

This site is the top-of-funnel marketing asset:

- **Shareable links**: "Want to understand our security model? Talk to our AppSec agent: team.send.sgraph.ai/appsec"
- **Conference talks**: demo the site live — "I'll ask our Architect to explain the data room encryption"
- **Social media**: screenshot interesting agent conversations, link to the site
- **Open source community**: "Want to contribute? Talk to our Developer agent about open issues: team.send.sgraph.ai/developer"

### For Open Source Contributors

A contributor arrives and wants to help:

```
Visitor: "I'm a developer, where can I contribute?"

Developer Agent: "Welcome! Here's where we need help right now:
1. The key discovery UI (v0.5.10 dev brief) — building the 
   public key registry page
2. File visualizers for the data room — PDF.js and markdown 
   rendering in sandboxed iframes
3. The SG/Send CLI — needed for GitHub-to-S3 sync pipeline
Check the v0.5.10 dev briefs for full specs. PRs welcome!"
```

This is massively better than a CONTRIBUTING.md file. The agent knows the current state, the priorities, and the specs. It can answer follow-up questions.

---

## Guest Access (from v0.4.11)

The "guest" concept mapped in earlier sessions applies here. A visitor to `team.send.sgraph.ai` is a guest:

- No authentication
- No stored state (unless they choose to install the pod for their own API key)
- Read access to all public agent context
- Chat access via Chrome AI / own key / free tier
- Cannot access admin functions, data rooms, or encrypted content

The guest experience is the entry point to the SG/Send ecosystem. A guest who finds the agents useful might:
- Star the GitHub repo
- Try SG/Send for encrypted file transfer
- Become a contributor
- Become a customer (for data rooms)

## Acceptance Criteria

| # | Criterion |
|---|---|
| 1 | Site is live at `team.send.sgraph.ai` (GitHub Pages + CNAME) |
| 2 | Home page shows all 19 agents in a grid with role summaries |
| 3 | Each agent has a dedicated chat page at `/{role}` |
| 4 | Agent context loads from GitHub Pages `context.md` files |
| 5 | Chat works with Chrome AI (no API key, no cost) |
| 6 | Chat works with visitor's own API key (stored in browser pod) |
| 7 | Chat works with Ollama (if running locally) |
| 8 | "Latest Updates" section shows current version and recent highlights |
| 9 | Links to GitHub repo (with star prompt), docs, and SG/Send main site |
| 10 | Fully static — no server-side code, no authentication, no database |
| 11 | `sg-send.js` and `pod-sw.js` are the same files used by the admin panel |
| 12 | Site works offline once loaded (all assets cached by SW) |
