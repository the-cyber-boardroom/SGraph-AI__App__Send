# Brief: Partner Ecosystem and Open Source Deployment Strategy

**version** v0.4.10  
**date** 18 Feb 2026  
**from** Human (project lead)  
**to** Ambassador (lead), DevOps, Architect, Cartographer  
**type** Strategic brief — partner manifesto, deployment packaging, channel strategy

## The Core Insight

SG/Send is open source (Apache 2.0). This isn't just a licensing choice — it's the commercial strategy. The human's position is clear and deliberate:

**We don't want to sell to large corporates directly.** We don't have the relationships, the sales team, the support infrastructure, or the procurement patience. What we have is technology that works, that's easy to deploy, and that's open source.

**Partners are the channel.** Companies that already have corporate relationships, commercial arrangements, and the ability to provide support — they take SG/Send, deploy it (with or without customisation), and serve their customers. We provide the technology. They provide the last mile.

**Partners are assets, not competitors.** This is the critical mindset shift. Every partner deployment increases usage, generates feedback, drives improvements to the codebase, and validates the product. The rising tide lifts all boats.

## Part 1: One-Click Deployment Packaging

Nothing says "open source, easy to use" like one-click deployment. The current product is deployed manually on AWS. We need to package it for every common deployment target.

### Deployment Targets

| Target | Package Format | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PyPI** | Python package (`pip install sgraph-send`) | P1 | Already Python. Should be the first and easiest. |
| **Docker Hub** | Docker image (`docker pull sgraph/send`) | P1 | Container-based deployment. Unlocks everything else. |
| **AWS CloudFormation** | CloudFormation template (one-click deploy) | P1 | Our current platform. Template should provision Lambda, S3, CloudFront, API Gateway. |
| **AWS Marketplace** | AMI or container listing | P2 | Discovery channel for AWS customers. Requires CloudFormation template first. |
| **Terraform** | Terraform module | P2 | For teams that use Terraform instead of CloudFormation. |
| **Google Cloud Run** | Deploy from Docker Hub → Cloud Run | P2 | Human already has GCP set up. Docker Hub unlocks this directly. |
| **EC2 AMI** | Pre-configured Amazon Machine Image | P3 | For teams that prefer traditional VM deployment. |
| **Azure** | Container Instances or App Service | P3 | Map the work now, implement later. Don't prioritise yet. |

### DevOps Deliverables

1. **Dockerfile** — containerise the current application. This should be the canonical deployment artefact.
2. **docker-compose.yml** — for local development and testing
3. **CloudFormation template** — one-click AWS deployment. Provisions all required resources. Takes parameters for domain name, S3 bucket name, etc.
4. **Terraform module** — equivalent to CloudFormation for Terraform users
5. **PyPI package** — `pip install sgraph-send` should give you a running instance locally
6. **Deployment documentation** — step-by-step guides for each platform. Not just "run this command" — explain what it does, what it provisions, what it costs.

**Architect**: review each deployment target. Are there architectural changes needed? (e.g., the current Lambda-based deployment won't work identically in Docker — we need the FastAPI server mode for container deployments.)

## Part 2: The Partner Manifesto

### What Partners Need to Hear

Partners will have questions. The manifesto should answer them directly, in plain language, before they ask:

**"Can we take the product without giving back?"**  
Yes. It's Apache 2.0. You can use it, modify it, and distribute it without contributing anything back. We'd love contributions, but they're not required.

**"Can we customise it?"**  
Yes. Apache 2.0. Fork it, brand it, extend it. It's yours.

**"Can we use it internally without telling anyone?"**  
Yes. Apache 2.0.

**"Can we charge our customers for it?"**  
Yes. You can build a commercial service on top of SG/Send and charge whatever you want.

**"What do YOU get out of this?"**  
Usage. Every deployment validates the technology. Every partner who builds on SG/Send makes the ecosystem stronger. And if you want help — customisation, deployment, integration, support — we offer professional services.

**"What does open source actually mean here?"**  
The code is publicly available, freely usable, and modifiable under the Apache 2.0 licence. The documentation and materials are released under Creative Commons BY. Everything is transparent.

### Rules of Engagement

The manifesto should include clear, simple rules:

1. **Use it freely** — Apache 2.0 for code, Creative Commons BY for documentation and materials
2. **Brand it your way** — co-branding is encouraged. White-labelling is fine. "Powered by SG/Send" is nice but not required.
3. **Deploy it anywhere** — AWS, GCP, Azure, on-premises, your customer's infrastructure. Your choice.
4. **Customise without limits** — modify the code, add features, change the UI, integrate with your systems
5. **We're here if you need us** — professional services available for deployment, customisation, integration, and support
6. **The relationship with your customer is yours** — we don't get in the middle. We work with you, not around you.

### What We Offer Partners

| Service | Description |
|---|---|
| **Deployment support** | We help you deploy SG/Send in your environment or your customer's environment |
| **Customisation** | We build custom features, integrations, or UI changes for your use case |
| **Co-branding** | Your firm's logo, colours, domain — professional, branded, trustworthy |
| **Training** | We train your team on the architecture, the code, and the security model |
| **Ongoing support** | SLA-based support for production deployments |
| **Architecture consulting** | We help you design the right deployment architecture for your scale and security requirements |

### The Commercial Model

- Partners deploy and operate SG/Send for their customers
- Partners charge their customers whatever they want
- If partners want our help (deployment, customisation, support), they pay for professional services
- There is no revenue share, no licence fee, no per-user charge from us
- The model is: technology is free, expertise costs money

## Part 3: Cloud Partner Programmes

### Research Task (Ambassador + Architect)

Investigate what's required to join the major cloud partner programmes:

| Programme | What It Gets Us | Research Needed |
|---|---|---|
| **AWS Partner Network (APN)** | Marketplace listing, co-marketing, customer referrals, AWS credits | What's the application process? What are the technical requirements? Do we need a specific deployment architecture? |
| **Google Cloud Partner Programme** | Cloud Run / Marketplace listing, co-marketing | What are the requirements? Does our Docker image qualify? |
| **Azure Partner Programme** | Azure Marketplace listing | What's required? Do we need an Azure-specific deployment? |
| **Startup accelerator programmes** | Funding, mentorship, visibility, cloud credits | Which programmes are relevant? AWS Activate, Google for Startups, Microsoft for Startups, Y Combinator, Techstars |

**Ambassador**: produce a research document mapping each programme's requirements, timeline, and what we'd need to prepare. This is a standalone deliverable.

## Part 4: KPI Dashboard

### What to Measure

The human wants a dashboard of key metrics — the Ambassador and Sherpa's domain:

**Product usage**:
- Files shared per day / week / month
- Unique sessions per day
- Downloads per transfer (ratio tells us about sharing patterns)
- Transfer sizes (what are people sending?)

**Community and growth**:
- GitHub stars
- GitHub forks
- GitHub contributors
- PyPI downloads
- Docker Hub pulls
- Social media mentions (LinkedIn, Twitter/X)

**Partner ecosystem** (future):
- Number of known partner deployments
- Number of partner enquiries
- Partner-originated feature requests

**Content and visibility**:
- Docs site traffic
- Blog post views
- LinkedIn post engagement

### Implementation

The SA (Server Analytics) pipeline already captures product usage data via CloudFront logs. The community metrics need collection from external APIs (GitHub API, PyPI API, Docker Hub API, social media APIs).

**DevOps + Developer**: extend the SA pipeline to collect community metrics. Build a KPI dashboard view in the admin panel.

**Ambassador + Sherpa**: define which metrics matter most and what the targets are. Not vanity metrics — metrics that indicate real usage and real value.

## Part 5: Creative Commons BY on All Materials

**Immediate action for all roles**: every document, article, guide, marketing piece, design asset, and public-facing material created for this project must include a Creative Commons BY licence notice.

Standard footer for all documents:

```

licence (CC BY 4.0). You are free to share and adapt this material for any purpose, 
including commercially, as long as you give appropriate credit.
```

**Librarian**: audit existing documents and add the CC BY footer where missing.

## The Question: Do We Need a Partner Role?

The human raised this: does the partner/channel work fit within the Ambassador role, or do we need a dedicated Partner Manager role?

Arguments for a separate role:
- Partners require sustained relationship management (not just communications)
- The commercial model (professional services, deployment support) needs its own focus
- Cloud partner programmes have their own requirements and timelines

Arguments for keeping it in the Ambassador:
- We're early — the volume doesn't justify a separate role yet
- The Ambassador already handles external communications and relationships
- Adding roles has a cost (cognitive overhead, coordination complexity)

**Recommendation**: keep it in the Ambassador for now, but flag it. When we have 3+ active partner conversations, revisit. The Ambassador should have a dedicated "Partner" subfolder in their role directory to keep the work organised and ready to spin out.
