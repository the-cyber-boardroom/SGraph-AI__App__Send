# User Interview: First External Security Reviewer

**Date:** 2026-02-17  
**Subject:** Levente Simon  
**Interviewer:** LLM Voice Mode (on behalf of the SGraph Send team  

## Key Takeaways

- The reviewer has 25 years of technical experience across security, architecture, operations, and development. He built security organizations for Telenor/CETIN across Central and Eastern Europe and worked on EUROCONTROL's aviation modernisation. He is currently building Dethernety, a graph-native threat modeling platform.
- The review was unplanned. He tested the product, found it useful, got curious about the codebase, cloned the repo, and it escalated into a full security analysis. "That wasn't the plan, it just happened."
- The crypto implementation is validated. "That's the correct implementation. I would have been surprised if it wasn't."
- The product's UX is strong enough that a security professional compared it to Google search: "I didn't need to think at all. It's like Google search: foolproof."
- Using SG/Send to deliver the security report was not a deliberate choice but an instinctive one: "I didn't even think about not using it."
- The market need is real and broad. "Security leaders, CISOs, legal teams, healthcare, accountants, payroll processors. Honestly, I don't know who wouldn't need this."
- Open source is non-negotiable for a zero-knowledge tool: "The code being open source means you can verify the crypto yourself. For a zero-knowledge tool, that's not optional."

## Part 1: The Person Behind the Review

The reviewer is not a typical security specialist. He has a master's degree in economics, which he says shapes how he approaches security: "I think about security in terms of trade-offs and resource optimization rather than controls and compliance." His career spans building security organizations at telecom scale (Telenor/CETIN, 10M+ subscribers across multiple countries), leading the security stream of a multi-country corporate separation, and architecting safety-critical aviation systems at EUROCONTROL.

He is currently independent, building Dethernety, a graph-native threat modeling platform. His motivation: "Security is a graph problem, and the industry keeps forcing it into spreadsheets."

He engaged with SG/Send out of curiosity about Dinis's work, introduced through Seba. "If someone like him is building something, it's probably worth looking at." The depth of the review was unplanned: "I didn't want to go back with just 'yes, it works.' I was curious what was behind it, so I cloned the repository and started looking around."

His methodology was iterative: unstructured discovery first, using Claude Code as an assistant, prioritizing coverage over structure. Once findings stopped emerging, he shifted to synthesis: structuring, verifying, filtering false positives, and building the final document step by step.

## Part 2: The Experience of Using SG/Send

First interaction was frictionless. He watched the intro video, entered the token, and understood immediately how to use the product. He tested across devices (Mac and iPad) and across methods (file upload, drag and drop, direct text).

He opened the JavaScript console during testing. "Other than a missing favicon, nothing." This detail says more about the reviewer than about the product: the instinct to check under the hood is automatic.

UI impression: "I didn't need to think at all. It's like Google search: foolproof."

Sending the report via SG/Send: "No friction at all. Drag and drop the file, copy the generated link, paste it to the chat."

The raw markdown display on the download page was noted, but he admitted he didn't read the report back on the page. He agreed a markdown renderer would be a good UX improvement.

When asked how he'd explain SG/Send in 30 seconds: "I would rather show it. 30 seconds is more than enough." This is a product endorsement stronger than any description.

No surprises during use. "And for a security tool, that's a good thing."

## Part 3: The Security Review

His severity framework was deliberately simple: a P0-P3 scale with even numbers of elements. "P0 is the highest criticality, P3 is something you still want to deal with, P1 and P2 are in between." Classification happened during the synthesis phase, not during discovery. "During the first pass it was just about finding things, not rating them."

The finding he spent the most time on: the token auth bypass via race condition. "Probably because it was the most sophisticated finding. The rest were more straightforward." He did not characterize it as concerning.

Crypto assessment confirmed: "Yes, it matched my assessment. And no, I wasn't surprised. That's the correct implementation. I would have been surprised if it wasn't."

On the "fails open" pattern: "It's common. Developers tend to write code without authentication first, auth comes as a bolt-on later. I can't blame them for that. They need results quick. But it means 'fails open' is the default until someone deliberately changes it to 'fails closed.'"

On localStorage vs. zero-knowledge tension: he framed it as a scale, not a binary. "The sweet spot is somewhere in the middle. Store only metadata in the session, or store encrypted history in localStorage. Maybe this could be a user setting: you choose your own trade-off."

The Firefox Send reference in the report came from Claude, not personal experience. "I checked what it was and it made sense, so I kept it." Transparent about AI assistance in the review process.

Feature suggestions aligning with the roadmap (12 of 13): "Anyone who has needed this kind of functionality would come up with more or less the same feature list."

## Part 4: The Market and the Need

Concrete use cases: business teams sharing marketing material with agencies before campaigns, sensitive legal documents shared externally. "These are cases where security awareness training isn't enough. You need a solution that a non-technical user can actually use."

The current state of secure file sharing: "7-zip with strong encryption was the common solution. But that was communication between professionals who accepted the lack of user experience for security. You can't ask a marketing manager to do that."

On the "other party needs the same tech" problem: "You can introduce whatever technology you want inside your organization, but you can't force the other end to use the same thing."

Most existing solutions fail on multiple dimensions: "uncomfortable to use, overkill for such a simple task, don't provide a zero-knowledge guarantee, or they're expensive. Usually a combination of all four."

Potential user base extends far beyond security: "Security leaders, CISOs, not only for themselves but to have a solution for cross-organization secret sharing. Beyond that, legal teams, healthcare, accountants, payroll processors. Honestly, I don't know who wouldn't need this."

Suggested feature: a "Share" button with different sharing options built in. New suggestion not in the original review.

Open source as a requirement: "I'm not saying I wouldn't use a closed-source solution if I had no choice. But I wouldn't choose one for this purpose."

Comfortable being publicly credited, with one condition: a review of the case study before publication.

## Part 5: Looking Forward

On treating the report as a P1 incident: "That's the professional way to do it. It always surprises me how many organizations don't."

If he could change one thing: the localStorage issue. "That's the one that directly touches the zero-knowledge promise."

Bug bounty participation: open but non-committal. "It always depends on my time. If I have it, I'm happy to contribute, but I can't commit to anything regular."

On ongoing engagement: "I did it because it was exciting and I had the time. I'm happy to contribute to open source initiatives voluntarily. Beyond that, as an independent consultant, I provide professional services too." A clear and professional boundary.

## Quotable Moments

1. **"I didn't need to think at all. It's like Google search: foolproof."** — First impression of the UI. Strongest single-line product endorsement in the interview. Useful for landing pages and pitch decks.

2. **"I didn't even think about not using it."** — On delivering the security report via SG/Send. Shows the product is a natural choice for its intended purpose, not something that requires convincing.

3. **"You can't ask a marketing manager to do that."** — On 7-zip as the current alternative. Captures the gap between professional-grade security tools and what non-technical users can actually adopt.

4. **"Honestly, I don't know who wouldn't need this."** — On who would find SG/Send useful. Broad market validation from someone who has worked across industries.

5. **"The code being open source means you can verify the crypto yourself. For a zero-knowledge tool, that's not optional."** — On open source. Positions open source not as a nice-to-have but as a requirement for the product category.

## Action Items for the Team

- **"Share" button feature request**: The reviewer suggested adding sharing options (email, chat) directly into the UI after encryption. New suggestion, not in the original review. Add to roadmap.
- **localStorage trade-off as a user setting**: The reviewer proposed letting users choose their own balance between usability and zero-knowledge purity: no storage, metadata only, or encrypted history. Evaluate as a feature.
- **Public credit**: The reviewer is comfortable being named publicly. Send the case study draft for review before publication.
- **Professional relationship**: He explicitly noted he provides professional services as an independent consultant. If ongoing security review or advisory is needed, this is a paid engagement, not a volunteer one.
- **Messaging**: Use the "You can't ask a marketing manager to do that" framing and the Google search comparison in product messaging. These are real user words, not marketing copy.

## Signals and Insights

- **The review was curiosity-driven, not obligation-driven.** He wasn't asked to do a security review. He was asked to test a product and went deep because the codebase pulled him in. This is a signal about the product's technical quality: it invites scrutiny rather than discouraging it.
- **Calm confidence throughout.** No moment of alarm, no "this is dangerous" energy. The tone was consistently "this is solid work with things to fix before production." That's reassuring for the team.
- **The economics background matters.** He repeatedly framed security decisions as trade-offs, not absolutes. The localStorage answer ("zero-knowledge as a scale"), the fails-open observation ("I can't blame them, they need results quick"), the market analysis ("uncomfortable, overkill, no zero-knowledge, expensive — usually all four"). This is someone who thinks about security in business terms.
- **AI transparency was natural, not defensive.** He mentioned using Claude Code for the review and Claude suggesting the Firefox Send reference without hesitation. No attempt to obscure AI involvement. This matters for a team that builds with AI agents.
- **The professional boundary was clear but not hostile.** "I'm happy to contribute to open source voluntarily. Beyond that, I provide professional services." He enjoys the work but knows its value. Any ongoing engagement beyond open source contribution should be structured as a paid relationship.
- **He's building something complementary.** Dethernety is a graph-native threat modeling platform. There may be a natural integration or partnership opportunity: SG/Send for secure sharing, Dethernety for security architecture analysis. Worth exploring in the Dethernety demo call.
