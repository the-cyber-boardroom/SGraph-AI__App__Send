## The Problem You Already Have

You manage multiple portfolio companies. Every day, confidential documents flow between you and those companies — term sheets, due diligence reports, financial statements, board materials, cap tables, passwords, access credentials, sensitive messages.

Right now, most of this happens through:

- **Email** — sent in cleartext across the internet. Sits in inboxes indefinitely. Forwarded without your knowledge. Searchable by every email provider.
- **WhatsApp/Slack** — WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted between users, which is good. But chat histories can be backed up to iCloud or Google Drive, and by default those cloud backups are NOT protected by WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption (there's an opt-in setting most users don't enable). So your confidential deal discussion may end up in a plaintext cloud backup. Slack messages are encrypted in transit but stored on Slack's servers — Slack (and its administrators) can access message content. Neither platform gives you governance over retention, forwarding, or who else in the organisation can search the history.
- **Zipped files via email** — a password-protected ZIP is better than nothing, but the password is usually sent in the same channel. And the file lives in the recipient's inbox forever.
- **Data rooms** — expensive, complex to set up, often overkill for a quick document exchange. And many firms don't have one.

You get away with this because you're the ones paying for it. But from a governance perspective, it's not good. Confidential deal documents sitting in email inboxes, financial reports shared via WhatsApp, passwords sent in Slack DMs — these are real risks.

## What SG/Send Offers Today

SG/Send is a zero-knowledge encrypted file and message transfer service. It works right now, in your browser, with no software to install.

### How It Works

1. You open SG/Send in your browser
2. You drop a file or type a message
3. The content is **encrypted in your browser** before it ever leaves your device
4. You receive a link (the file ID) and a separate decryption key
5. You send the link to the recipient via one channel, and the decryption key via a different channel
6. The recipient opens the link, enters the decryption key, and decrypts the content in their browser

**The server never sees your data in plaintext.** The encryption and decryption happen entirely in the browser. SG/Send stores only encrypted bytes — even we cannot read your files.

### Two Secrets, Two Channels

Security depends on two separate pieces of information:

| Secret | What It Is | How to Share It |
|---|---|---|
| **File ID / Link** | The URL that locates the encrypted file on the server | Send via email, Slack, or any convenient channel |
| **Decryption Key** | The cryptographic key that unlocks the content | Send via a DIFFERENT channel — text message, phone call, in-person, Signal |

Without both, the file cannot be read. An attacker who intercepts the link sees only encrypted bytes. An attacker who intercepts the key has nothing to decrypt. Both must be compromised simultaneously — and if they're sent via separate channels, that's significantly harder.

This also gives you a form of **recipient verification**: if you know that only one specific person received the decryption key (because you told them on a phone call, or handed them a card), then you know that person is the only one who could have read the content.

## Use Cases That Work Today

### 1. Sending Confidential Messages

**The scenario**: you need to send a sensitive message to a portfolio company CEO — financial guidance, a strategic direction, a sensitive personnel matter. You don't want it sitting in an email inbox or a Slack channel.

**With SG/Send**: type the message in SG/Send, encrypt it, send the link via email and the key via text message. The CEO decrypts it in their browser, reads it, and the message never exists in plaintext on any server. No email trail. No Slack history. No forwarding.

**Current alternative**: email (plaintext in transit, permanent, forwardable) or WhatsApp (end-to-end encrypted between users, but cloud backups are unencrypted by default — your sensitive message may end up in a plaintext iCloud or Google Drive backup you don't control).

### 2. Sharing Deal Documents

**The scenario**: you're in due diligence on a potential acquisition. The target company needs to send you financial statements, contracts, IP documentation, employee records. You need to send them a term sheet.

**With SG/Send**: each document is encrypted individually with its own key. You control who gets which key. The target company's CFO sends you the financials through SG/Send — you receive the link, they call you with the key. You send the term sheet back the same way.

**Current alternative**: a data room (expensive, takes time to set up) or email with password-protected ZIPs (the password is usually sent in the same email thread).

### 3. Sharing Credentials and Access Keys

**The scenario**: a portfolio company needs to give you admin access to their AWS console, their banking portal, or their analytics dashboard. They need to send you usernames, passwords, API keys, or MFA seeds.

**With SG/Send**: the credentials are encrypted and sent as a text message or file. You decrypt them in your browser, use them, and they never exist in an email or chat log. If needed, the SG/Send link can be configured to expire after a set time or number of uses.

**Current alternative**: passwords sent via email (terrible), via Slack DM (stored on Slack's servers), or via a password manager's sharing feature (requires both parties to use the same password manager).

### 4. A Simple, Encrypted Data Room

**The scenario**: you're managing a deal and need a central place for all related documents — a data room.

**With SG/Send**: a dedicated SG/Send deployment (its own AWS account, its own S3 bucket) serves as an encrypted data room. All documents related to the deal are uploaded, encrypted, and stored in one place. Access is controlled by who has the decryption keys.

It's not a sophisticated data room with folder structures and permissions (that's coming — see the next document). But it IS:
- **Encrypted at rest** — the S3 bucket contains only encrypted bytes
- **Isolated** — one deployment per deal, or one deployment per portfolio company. No data mixing.
- **Archivable** — when the deal closes, zip the S3 bucket contents. As long as you retain the decryption keys, you can restore and read everything years later.
- **Auditable** — server-side logs show when files were uploaded and accessed (without revealing their contents)

### 5. Isolation Between Portfolio Companies

**The scenario**: you manage 15 portfolio companies. You don't want Company A's documents anywhere near Company B's infrastructure.

**With SG/Send**: spin up a separate deployment per company. Each company gets its own AWS account (or its own S3 bucket within your AWS environment). Complete isolation. No shared storage, no shared keys, no cross-contamination.

Even better: run SG/Send **inside the portfolio company's own AWS account**. The data never leaves their environment. You access it through their deployment. This is the strongest possible governance model — the company owns their own data, and you access it through a zero-knowledge interface.

## Deployment Options

| Option | Description | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **Shared instance** | Use the main SG/Send deployment at send.sgraph.com | Quick, informal transfers. Testing the workflow. |
| **Dedicated instance** | A dedicated SG/Send deployment in our AWS account, with its own subdomain and S3 bucket | A firm that wants isolation but doesn't want to manage infrastructure |
| **Self-hosted** | SG/Send deployed in YOUR AWS account (or your portfolio company's account) | Maximum control. Data never leaves your environment. |

All three options use the same zero-knowledge encryption model. The only difference is who owns the infrastructure.

Deployment is serverless (Lambda + S3 + CloudFront + API Gateway). Spinning up a new instance takes minutes, not days. There's no server to manage, no patches to apply, no databases to maintain.

## What This Costs

SG/Send is serverless. The infrastructure cost is:
- **S3 storage**: pennies per GB per month for encrypted file storage
- **Lambda**: fractions of a cent per request
- **CloudFront**: standard CDN pricing for file delivery

For a typical investment firm's document volume (hundreds of documents per deal, a handful of active deals), the AWS infrastructure cost is negligible — likely under $50/month for a dedicated instance.

The value is not in the infrastructure. The value is in the governance, the encryption, the audit trail, and the peace of mind that your most sensitive documents aren't sitting in plaintext on email servers.
