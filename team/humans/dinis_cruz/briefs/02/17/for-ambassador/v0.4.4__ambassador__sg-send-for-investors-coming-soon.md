## Building on What Works

The previous document described what SG/Send does today: zero-knowledge encrypted file and message transfer, dedicated deployments, portfolio company isolation, and a basic encrypted data room.

This document covers what's coming in the next releases — and what's available right now if you'd like us to configure it for your specific needs through a professional services engagement.

These are features that either are partially built, straightforward to implement, or require light customisation for your environment. They aren't speculative — they're engineering work measured in days and weeks, not months.

## Recipient-Defined Encryption Keys

**What it is**: instead of SG/Send generating the encryption key, the recipient defines the key they want used. Before you send them anything, they provide you with their preferred encryption key (or passphrase). All files sent to them are encrypted with their key.

**Why it matters for investors**: your portfolio company's CFO tells you "use this key for all documents you send me." Now every document you send them is encrypted with a key that only they chose and only they know. You never store their key. They never worry about key distribution. It's their secret, end to end.

**Timeline**: near-term release.

## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

**What it is**: instead of symmetric keys (where both parties share the same secret), SG/Send supports asymmetric encryption. The recipient publishes a public key. Anyone can encrypt files with that public key, but only the recipient's private key can decrypt them.

**Why it matters for investors**: your firm publishes a public key on your website or distributes it to portfolio companies. Anyone who needs to send you confidential documents encrypts them with your public key. Only your firm can decrypt them. No key exchange needed. No out-of-band communication for the decryption secret. The public key is, well, public — it can be shared freely.

This also provides **sender verification**: if the sender signs the document with their private key, you can verify it was them who sent it. Non-repudiation — they can't deny sending it.

**Timeline**: near-term release. The hybrid encryption model (per-file symmetric key, wrapped with the recipient's public key) is already part of the architecture.

## Read Receipts and Download Tracking

**What it is**: when you send a document, you can see exactly when the recipient opened and downloaded it. Real-time visibility into whether your file has been received.

**Why it matters for investors**: you send a term sheet to a company's board. You need to know: did they receive it? Did they open it? When? This is especially important for time-sensitive documents — offers with deadlines, regulatory filings, board materials that need to be read before a meeting.

The admin panel shows:
- When the link was first accessed
- When the file was decrypted and downloaded
- How many times it's been accessed
- From what time zones (without revealing IP addresses — privacy by design)

**Timeline**: near-term release. The server-side tracking infrastructure exists; the admin UI is being built.

## One-Time Access and Self-Destructing Messages

**What it is**: configure a file or message to be accessible only once. After one download, the access is revoked. Or set a time limit — the file is available for one hour, one day, or one week, then it's automatically deleted.

**Why it matters for investors**:

- **One-time download**: send credentials (passwords, API keys, MFA seeds) that can only be retrieved once. If someone tries to access the link again, it's gone. You know that exactly one person downloaded it.
- **Time-limited access**: share a draft term sheet that expires in 24 hours. If the deal doesn't close, the document disappears. No need to chase people to delete it.
- **Self-destructing messages**: send a sensitive message that's available for one hour, then gone. No permanent record on any server.

**Timeline**: near-term release. Token-based access control is already in the system; expiry and usage limits are being added.

## Co-Branding

**What it is**: SG/Send deployments can be branded with your firm's identity — logo, colours, domain name. Or co-branded with both your firm and the portfolio company.

**Why it matters for investors**: when you send a portfolio company a link to download a document, they see YOUR brand, not a generic tool. It looks professional. It builds trust. It signals that you take data security seriously.

Multiple branding levels:
- **Your firm's brand**: the entire SG/Send instance is branded as yours. Your logo, your colours, your domain (e.g., secure.yourfirm.com).
- **Co-branded**: your firm's brand on the header, the portfolio company's brand in the context. "Sent by [Your Firm] to [Portfolio Company]."
- **White-label**: no SG/Send branding at all. It's entirely your product.

**Timeline**: the theming infrastructure exists (multiple theme support is already built). Custom branding is a professional services engagement — we configure it for your brand.

## IP Restrictions

**What it is**: restrict file access to specific IP ranges or corporate networks. Even with the correct decryption key, the file can only be downloaded from approved network locations.

**Why it matters for investors**: for the most sensitive documents (board materials, M&A terms, regulatory filings), you can ensure they're only accessible from your office network or VPN. An employee can't accidentally download them from a café Wi-Fi network.

**Timeline**: professional services engagement. Requires configuration per deployment.

## Client Authentication (Cognito Integration)

**What it is**: add an authentication layer so that only specific, identified users can access files. Integrated with AWS Cognito for user management — or with your existing identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, etc.) via SAML/OIDC federation.

**Why it matters for investors**: instead of "anyone with the link and key can access this file," it becomes "only these three people, logged in with their corporate credentials, with the key, can access this file." Three layers of security: identity + link + decryption key.

This also gives you a full audit trail tied to named users — "John Smith from ABC Capital downloaded the Q3 financials at 14:32 on Tuesday."

**Timeline**: Cognito integration is a professional services engagement. Federation with your existing identity provider adds complexity but is achievable.

## Enhanced Data Room

The basic encrypted data room (a dedicated S3 bucket with encrypted files) becomes significantly more capable:

### Structured Data Rooms

**What it is**: instead of a flat bucket of encrypted files, the data room has structure — folders, categories, document types. A web interface lets you browse, upload, and manage documents.

**Why it matters for investors**: a proper data room experience. Due diligence documents organised by category (financials, legal, IP, HR, operations). Board materials organised by meeting date. Portfolio company reports organised by quarter.

### Multi-Room Management

**What it is**: a management dashboard that shows all your data rooms — one per deal, one per portfolio company, or however you want to organise them. See status, activity, and access history across all rooms.

**Why it matters for investors**: you manage 15 portfolio companies and 3 active deals. You need to see all of them in one place. Which rooms are active? Which have recent uploads? Which keys are about to expire?

### Key Management Integration

**What it is**: integration with AWS Secrets Manager (or HashiCorp Vault, or your preferred secrets management platform) to centralise all encryption keys. No more tracking keys in spreadsheets or password managers.

**Why it matters for investors**: as you manage more data rooms and more portfolio companies, key management becomes critical. A centralised secrets manager ensures:
- Keys are never lost (backed up, versioned, recoverable)
- Key access is audited (who accessed which key, when)
- Key rotation is possible (change keys without re-encrypting everything, using the symmetric key wrapping model)
- Keys are separated from the encrypted data (even if someone accesses the S3 bucket, the keys are in a different system)

**Timeline**: structured data rooms and multi-room management are near-term development. Secrets manager integration is a professional services engagement.

## Use Cases Unlocked by These Features

### Due Diligence Workflow

1. Create a data room for the deal (dedicated deployment, co-branded with the target company)
2. Target company uploads due diligence documents — financials, contracts, IP records — each encrypted with your firm's public key (PKI)
3. Your team accesses the documents from your office network (IP restriction), authenticated with your corporate credentials (Cognito)
4. You see who on your team has accessed which documents (audit trail)
5. You send the term sheet back, configured for one-time download with a 48-hour expiry
6. You get a read receipt when the CEO downloads the term sheet
7. Deal closes. Archive the data room. Keys stored in Secrets Manager for compliance retention.

### Board Materials Distribution

1. Create a distribution list for board members (each with their own access credentials)
2. Upload board pack — encrypted, time-limited (available for one week around the board meeting)
3. Each board member accesses from their authenticated device
4. You see who has read the materials before the meeting (and who hasn't)
5. After the meeting, materials expire automatically. Archive copy retained in the data room.

### Portfolio Company Reporting

1. Each portfolio company has its own data room (running in their own AWS account if preferred)
2. Monthly: the company uploads financial reports, encrypted with your public key
3. You receive a notification, download and decrypt the reports
4. The report is automatically available to your analytics team (with the right key access)
5. Historical reports are archived in the data room — searchable, auditable, encrypted
