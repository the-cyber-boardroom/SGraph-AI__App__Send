## Where This Is Going

The previous two documents covered what SG/Send does today (zero-knowledge encrypted transfer, dedicated deployments, basic data rooms) and what's coming soon (PKI, read receipts, co-branding, authentication, structured data rooms, key management).

This document looks further ahead — features that are in research or early development, based on the architecture we're building now. These aren't speculative wishes. They're the natural evolution of the platform, and the engineering foundations are already being laid.

For an investment firm, this is where SG/Send goes from "a secure way to send files" to "the platform that manages all confidential communication across your entire portfolio."

## Automatic Translation for Portfolio Companies

### The Feature

When you send a document to a portfolio company (or they send one to you), SG/Send can automatically translate the content into the recipient's language — and not just linguistically, but into their specific cultural and business context.

### Why It Matters for Investors

You're a London-based fund that manages companies in Brazil, Germany, and Japan. Today, a quarterly report from your Brazilian company arrives in Portuguese. Someone on your team translates it (or you pay for translation), and you lose days.

With SG/Send's translation layer:
- The Brazilian company uploads their report in Portuguese
- You receive it already translated into English — automatically, at the point of decryption
- The translation respects your firm's terminology (your glossary, your preferred terms for financial concepts)
- The original Portuguese version is preserved alongside the translation (full provenance)
- Your German portfolio company receives the same report translated into German, using THEIR preferred business language

This works in the other direction too. You send board directives in English. Each portfolio company receives them in their local language, adapted to their corporate culture and communication style.

### The Enterprise Dimension

For firms with acquired companies that retain their own brand identity: the translation isn't just language. It's **voice**. An acquired company in São Paulo that kept its brand identity receives communications in their brand's tone, not the mothership's corporate voice. The content is the same. The way it's expressed respects the company's identity.

Per-entity translation profiles accumulate over time — approved terminology, glossary, cultural preferences, brand voice guidelines. Each portfolio company is a translation profile. The quality improves with every interaction.

## Semantic Knowledge Extraction

### The Feature

When a document is uploaded to SG/Send, the platform can automatically extract structured information — entities, relationships, financial figures, dates, obligations, risks — and map them to a knowledge graph.

### Why It Matters for Investors

You receive a 200-page due diligence report. Today, someone on your team reads it, extracts the key information, and enters it into your tracking system manually. It takes hours or days.

With semantic knowledge extraction:
- The document is uploaded and encrypted
- On decryption (client-side, maintaining zero-knowledge), the content is analysed
- Entities are extracted: company names, people, financial figures, dates, legal obligations
- Relationships are mapped: who owns what, who owes what to whom, what's the corporate structure
- The extracted data is structured as a knowledge graph — queryable, visualisable, comparable

**The killer feature: ontology mapping.** If your firm already has a schema — a standard structure for how you track portfolio companies, deals, risks, obligations — SG/Send can map incoming documents to YOUR ontology automatically. The 200-page due diligence report arrives already structured in your format. Your analysts review and refine, not start from scratch.

### How This Works Securely

The extraction happens **on the client side** — the decrypted document never goes to SG/Send's servers. The LLM analysis runs in the browser (via client-side models or WASM) or, with the user's consent, via an API call. The resulting knowledge graph is encrypted and stored in your data room alongside the source document.

This means:
- Your documents are never exposed in plaintext to SG/Send's infrastructure
- The extracted knowledge is encrypted with the same keys as the source documents
- The ontology mapping is your intellectual property, encrypted at rest

## Interactive Encrypted Workflows

### The Feature

Instead of just sending files and text, SG/Send supports **structured data exchange with interactive interfaces** — all encrypted end-to-end.

The sender packages data as JSON with a UI schema. The recipient decrypts it and sees a rich, interactive form — approval buttons, review interfaces, editable fields, comment sections — rendered dynamically in their browser. They interact with it, and their responses are encrypted and sent back as structured JSON.

### Why It Matters for Investors

**Board resolution approval**: send a resolution to five board members. Each sees an approval interface — "Approve / Reject / Request Changes" with a comment field. Responses come back as structured data. You see a dashboard: 3 approved, 1 requested changes, 1 hasn't responded yet. All encrypted. The server never sees the resolution or the votes.

**Due diligence checklists**: send the target company a structured checklist of documents and information you need. They see a clear interface showing what's been provided and what's outstanding. They upload documents directly into the checklist. You see completion status in real-time.

**Financial data collection**: instead of asking portfolio companies to "send us your Q3 numbers," send them a structured form with the exact fields you need. They fill it in. The data comes back in your format, ready to import into your systems. No more reformatting spreadsheets.

**Translation review**: documents sent to portfolio companies in other languages can include a review workflow — the local team confirms the translation is accurate before the document is considered delivered.

## Resilient Large File Transfer

### The Feature

The SG/Send transfer engine is being rebuilt as a standalone component with enterprise-grade capabilities:

- **Chunked uploads and downloads** — large files are split into pieces, uploaded in parallel, and reassembled
- **Resume capability** — if the connection drops, the transfer picks up where it left off (even across sessions)
- **Integrity verification** — every chunk is checksummed. The reconstructed file is guaranteed identical to the original
- **Compression** — files are compressed before encryption to reduce transfer time and storage cost
- **Progress visibility** — detailed, real-time progress at three levels of detail (simple bar, stage detail, raw technical)
- **Bandwidth control** — throttle transfers to avoid saturating the network

### Why It Matters for Investors

Data rooms for M&A deals can contain gigabytes of documents — financial records going back years, legal contracts, technical documentation. Current file sharing tools struggle with large volumes. Uploads time out. Downloads fail halfway. Progress bars freeze.

SG/Send's transfer engine is designed for exactly this: large files, unreliable networks, zero tolerance for data loss. Upload a 10 GB data room archive and know it will get there, intact, even if the WiFi drops three times along the way.

## Folder Sync Between Parties

### The Feature

Beyond individual file transfers, SG/Send will support **folder synchronisation** between two parties. Changes to files in a shared folder are detected, and only the changed portions (deltas) are encrypted and synced.

### Why It Matters for Investors

Your portfolio company maintains a folder of monthly financial reports. When they update the folder (add a new report, revise an existing one), only the changes are synced to your data room. You don't re-download the entire folder — just the delta.

For ongoing portfolio monitoring, this means:
- Near-real-time access to updated financials and reports
- Minimal bandwidth usage (only changes are transferred)
- Full version history (every version of every file is retained, encrypted)
- Audit trail of what changed, when, and by whom

---

## WebRTC Peer-to-Peer Transfer

### The Feature

When both parties are online simultaneously, SG/Send can use WebRTC to transfer files **directly between browsers** — no server in the data path. The server handles only the signalling (connection setup) and metadata. The actual file data goes peer-to-peer.

### Why It Matters for Investors

For the most sensitive transfers — where you don't want the data to touch ANY server, even encrypted — peer-to-peer transfer means the file goes directly from the sender's browser to the recipient's browser. The server never sees even the encrypted bytes.

This is the strongest possible security model: the server is reduced to a signalling service. The data path is entirely between the two parties.

## Multi-Company Governance Dashboard

### The Feature

A unified dashboard that gives you visibility across all your portfolio companies, data rooms, and encrypted communications:

- Which data rooms are active, and what's their status
- Which documents have been uploaded/downloaded recently
- Which keys are active, which are expiring, which need rotation
- Which portfolio companies have pending documents you haven't reviewed
- Compliance status across all entities
- Cost and usage analytics per company

### Why It Matters for Investors

You manage 20 portfolio companies across 5 countries. You need one place to see everything — without compromising the isolation between companies. Each company's data is in its own encrypted silo, but your dashboard gives you a unified operational view.

The governance dashboard answers the questions you're already asking:
- "Has the Brazil team submitted their Q3 financials yet?"
- "Who has accessed the M&A documents this week?"
- "Are all our encryption keys current?"
- "What's our total data room storage cost this month?"

## Secrets Manager as a Service

### The Feature

Beyond integrating with your existing secrets manager, SG/Send can provide **secrets management as a built-in feature** — a secure, audited vault for all encryption keys, access tokens, and credentials related to your portfolio.

### Why It Matters for Investors

Key management is the hardest part of encryption at scale. As you add more portfolio companies, more data rooms, more users, and more documents, the number of keys grows. Losing a key means losing access to everything encrypted with it — permanently.

A built-in secrets manager means:
- All keys are centrally managed, backed up, and versioned
- Key rotation is automated (wrapped symmetric keys are re-wrapped without re-encrypting files)
- Access to keys is audited (who accessed which key, when, why)
- Key policies are enforceable (this key expires in 90 days, this key requires two-person access)
- Key recovery is possible (with appropriate controls — e.g., M-of-N key recovery)

---

## The Complete Picture

When all of these features come together, here's what an investment firm's workflow looks like:

```
DEAL ORIGINATION
─────────────────
→ Create a data room for the deal (dedicated, isolated, co-branded)
→ Target company uploads due diligence docs (encrypted with your public key)
→ Documents automatically translated into your working language
→ Semantic extraction maps key information to your ontology
→ Your team reviews via interactive encrypted workflows
→ Term sheet sent back, one-time download, 48-hour expiry, read receipt

DEAL EXECUTION
─────────────────
→ Legal documents exchanged via PKI-encrypted transfers
→ Board approvals collected via interactive encrypted forms
→ Credentials and access keys shared via self-destructing messages
→ All activity audited, all keys managed centrally
→ Data room archived on deal close, keys retained for compliance

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
─────────────────
→ Each company has its own data room (in their own AWS account)
→ Monthly reports sync automatically (folder sync, delta only)
→ Reports auto-translated to your language with your terminology
→ Governance dashboard shows status across all companies
→ Encrypted communication channel for sensitive ongoing dialogue

CROSS-PORTFOLIO
─────────────────
→ Multi-company analytics from extracted knowledge graphs
→ Unified compliance view across all entities and jurisdictions
→ Cost optimisation: which companies are using the most resources
→ Key rotation and security posture managed centrally
```

## The Competitive Advantage

Most encrypted communication tools solve one piece of this puzzle. A secure email tool handles messages but not data rooms. A data room product handles documents but not ongoing communication. A translation service handles language but not encryption.

SG/Send is building the full stack: **encrypted transfer + data rooms + translation + knowledge extraction + interactive workflows + governance**, unified on a single zero-knowledge platform that can be deployed in your environment or ours.

For an investment firm managing sensitive communications across multiple companies, multiple countries, and multiple languages, this isn't a nice-to-have. It's the infrastructure that makes secure, compliant, efficient portfolio management possible.
