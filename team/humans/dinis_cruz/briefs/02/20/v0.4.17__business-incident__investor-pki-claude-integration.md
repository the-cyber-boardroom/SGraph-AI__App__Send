# BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY BRIEF: Investor Meeting — PKI and Claude Integration

**version** v0.4.17  
**date** 19 Feb 2026  
**classification** B3 (treated as B1) / D1 (maximum development priority)  
**from** Human (project lead)  
**to** All teams — Architect (lead), Developer, Designer, Sherpa, Ambassador, AppSec, GRC  
**type** Business incident — clear and present opportunity  
**status** OPEN — Follow-up meeting to be booked for next week  

---

## New: Business Priority Classification (B0–B10)

This brief introduces a new classification axis alongside the existing P0–P10 (security priority):

| Axis | Scale | What It Measures | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P** (Security) | P0–P10 | Security impact and urgency | P0 = active breach, pull the plug |
| **B** (Business) | B0–B10 | Business opportunity / strategic impact | B0 = existential business crisis |
| **D** (Development) | D0–D10 | Development priority and resource allocation | D0 = stop everything, fix this now |

These axes are related but independent. A P0 security incident will always be B0 and D0 (everything aligned). But a B1 business opportunity might be P5 security and D1 development — high business urgency, moderate security relevance, maximum dev priority.

**GRC**: create the B0–B10 and D0–D10 classification frameworks, following the same pattern as the P0–P10 security framework. Same structure, same rigour, different domain.

### This Opportunity's Classification

| Axis | Rating | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| **B** | B3 → treated as B1 | Real investor group, real interest, follow-up meeting booked. Not existential, but the highest-priority business opportunity we have right now. |
| **D** | D1 | Maximum development priority. The deliverables for this opportunity should be our primary focus for the next work streams. |
| **P** | P5 | PKI is a security feature, but this work stream is business-driven, not security-driven. |

### Security Team Running Business Incidents

An important structural decision: **the security team (GRC, AppSec, incident response) will run this business opportunity using the same incident management discipline they use for security incidents.**

Why? Because they're the only team that knows how to run incidents. The skills transfer directly: assess the situation, classify severity, assign owners, define actions, track progress, communicate status, debrief.

This is also intentional cross-training. The human wants the security roles to take on business roles temporarily — the questions being asked are business questions, but the discipline for answering them is incident management.

## What Happened

The human had a meeting with an investor group — a group they've known from previous startups, who have historically been friendly but never deeply engaged. This time was different.

**What changed**: the human sent them the investor meeting briefing (v0.4.10) via SG/Send in advance. They read it. They liked it. They had specific questions. They asked for a follow-up meeting.

**Key validation points from the meeting**:

1. They tried SG/Send and understood it immediately
2. They saw the Portuguese version demo
3. They understood the zero-knowledge model and the market need
4. They did NOT question the "why" — they accepted that this is needed and that they should be customers
5. What they DID question was the "how easy" — can this be seamless enough to fit into their existing workflow?

---

## "SigSend" — The Name

During the call, the investors naturally started pronouncing "SG/Send" as **"SigSend"** (SIG-send). The human adopted it by the end of the call.

It works:
- Rolls off the tongue better than "S-G-Send"
- Aligns phonetically with "Signal" — "SigSend" is one letter away from "Signal Send"
- Pairs with the "Signal for the web" tagline from the tube encounter
- Still maps to the SG/Send branding (SG → Sig)

**Ambassador**: evaluate "SigSend" as the spoken brand name. "SG/Send" remains the written form. "SigSend" becomes how people say it. This is organic — the investors named it, not us.

## The Killer Feature: PKI

### What the Investor Said

His use case: he wants to send an NDA or a term sheet to a founder. Right now, there's no good automation for this. He composes the document, sends it by email, and hopes for the best.

He understood SG/Send's value immediately. But he kept coming back to one friction point: **key exchange**. How do I share the key? How does the recipient get it? Do I need to use a separate channel every time?

Then the conversation arrived at PKI (Public Key Infrastructure). The human explained: what if the recipient has a public key? You encrypt with their public key. Only their private key can decrypt. No key exchange needed. No second channel. No friction.

**"If you can do that, that's a killer feature."**

They then spent time discussing how public keys would be shared and registered — LinkedIn profiles, company websites, a public key registry. The investor immediately grasped that this solves the "how do I send the key?" problem permanently.

### Why This Is B1

The investor's reaction was unambiguous. PKI is the feature that converts SG/Send from "interesting security tool" to "must-have business workflow." His exact need: compose a document, encrypt it for a specific person, send it, done. No key exchange. No extra steps. No bottleneck.

## What We Need to Build

### Part 1: Browser-Based Key Management

A key management interface in SG/Send where users can:

1. **Generate keys**: create a public/private key pair in the browser (client-side, never leaves the device)
2. **Store keys**: private keys stored securely in the browser (investigate browser credential APIs, Web Crypto API key storage, or secure localStorage patterns)
3. **Name keys**: multiple key pairs for different personas or contexts ("Work", "Personal", "Board Communications")
4. **Share public keys**: publish your public key via SG/Send — generate a link or short code that others can use to retrieve your public key
5. **Import keys**: import someone else's public key (from a link, a file, or a registry)
6. **Delete keys**: remove key pairs from the browser

**Technical research needed**:

| Question | Owner |
|---|---|
| Can we generate asymmetric key pairs using the Web Crypto API? (RSA, ECDSA, or PQC algorithms) | Developer, Architect |
| Can the Web Crypto API store keys as non-extractable? (private key never leaves the browser's secure storage) | Developer |
| Do we need WASM modules for PQC key generation, or is Web Crypto sufficient for classical PKI? | Architect |
| What libraries exist for browser-based PKI? | Developer |
| Can we integrate with existing password managers for key storage? | Architect |
| Does Gmail support S/MIME or PGP? Can we leverage existing email PKI? | Architect |

**Important**: this should be a **separate UI** — an extension of the current interface, not a modification. Don't touch the existing send/receive flow. Add a new "Keys" section alongside it.

### Part 2: PKI-Enabled Encryption Flow

Once keys exist, the encryption flow changes:

**Current flow** (symmetric):
```
Sender: type message → encrypt with random key → get link + key → send link via email, key via SMS
```

**PKI flow** (asymmetric):
```
Sender: type message → select recipient's public key → encrypt → get link → send link via email
(No key to share — the recipient's private key decrypts it)
```

The recipient opens the link. Their browser has their private key. Decryption happens automatically. One channel. No key exchange. No friction.

**Design question**: how does the sender select the recipient? Options:
- Choose from a list of imported public keys ("Send to: Alice's work key")
- Enter a short code that resolves to a public key ("Recipient code: A7X9F2")
- Enter a URL that hosts the recipient's public key

### Part 3: Public Key Sharing via Short Codes

The human described a simple sharing mechanism:

1. User generates a key pair in SG/Send
2. SG/Send generates a short code (5–6 characters, alphanumeric) linked to the public key
3. User tells the recipient: "My SigSend code is A7X9F2"
4. Recipient enters the code in SG/Send → retrieves the public key → can now send encrypted content

This is like a two-factor verification code but for key exchange. The code is not secret (the public key is, by definition, public). It's just a convenient lookup mechanism.

**Security note from AppSec**: the short code resolves to a PUBLIC key. There's no security risk if the code is guessed or brute-forced — the attacker gets a public key, which is... public. We can still rate-limit lookups to prevent enumeration, but the security model doesn't depend on code secrecy.

### Part 4: Claude Skill / LLM Integration

This is the feature the investor explicitly asked about. His workflow:

1. He's in Claude, composing a document (NDA, term sheet, email)
2. He says: "Claude, send this to [founder name] securely via SigSend"
3. Claude encrypts the document using the recipient's public key
4. Claude uploads the encrypted content to SG/Send via the API
5. Claude sends the email with the SG/Send link
6. Done. One instruction. Fully automated.

**Why this works with the trust model**: the investor is already trusting Claude with the confidential document (he's composing it in Claude). We're not introducing a new trust boundary. Claude already has the plaintext. We're just automating the encryption and delivery.

**Implementation approaches**:

| Approach | Platform | Complexity |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Skill** | Claude.ai / Claude Code | Medium — a skill that knows the SG/Send API, can generate/use keys, can encrypt and upload |
| **OpenAI GPT** | ChatGPT | Medium — a custom GPT with actions that call the SG/Send API |
| **MCP Server** | Claude Code / any MCP client | Medium — a Model Context Protocol server that exposes SG/Send as a tool |
| **CLI tool** | Terminal / scripts | Low — a command-line tool that Claude Code or any LLM can invoke |

**The human's insight**: Claude (or any LLM with code execution) can already do PKI. Claude can run Python/bash to generate keys, encrypt with a public key, make HTTP POST requests to our API, and compose the email. We don't necessarily need native PKI in the browser for THIS workflow — the LLM is the execution environment.

But we should build both paths: browser-native PKI (for direct human use) and LLM-integrated PKI (for the Claude/GPT workflow).

### Part 5: The API

For the LLM integration to work, we need a clean API:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/upload` | Upload encrypted content, get a link ID back |
| `GET /api/keys/{code}` | Retrieve a public key by short code |
| `POST /api/keys` | Register a public key and get a short code |

The API already partially exists (we have API keys for upload). Extend it with key management endpoints.

## Deliverables for the Next Meeting

The human wants **4–5 concrete things to show the investor** at the follow-up meeting next week. The goal: get sign-off from the investor that "yes, this is exactly what we mean, this matches our expectations."

### Proposed Deliverables

| # | Deliverable | What It Shows | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Browser key pair generation demo** | User visits SG/Send, generates a key pair, sees their public key and short code | Developer, Architect |
| 2 | **PKI encryption demo** | User encrypts a message using a recipient's public key (imported via short code). Recipient decrypts with their private key. No key exchange. | Developer |
| 3 | **Claude skill prototype** | Working demo: "Claude, send this document to [recipient] via SigSend." Claude encrypts, uploads, generates link, composes email. | Developer, Architect |
| 4 | **Architecture document** | Clean diagram showing the PKI flow, the key management model, and the LLM integration. Professional enough to share with investors. | Architect, Designer |
| 5 | **Roadmap with this feature highlighted** | Updated roadmap showing PKI as the priority, with timeline estimates. Shows we heard them and reprioritised. | Ambassador |

**Ambassador**: draft these as a proposal document that the human can share with the investor BEFORE the meeting, framing it as: "Based on our conversation, here's what we're building. Does this match your expectations? Are we missing anything?"

Get sign-off on the plan before building more. The investor's validation is worth more than our assumptions.

## For the Ambassador

This meeting is validation of the entire investor pitch strategy. The materials we sent (v0.4.10 investor briefing) worked — they read it, understood it, and had specific questions. Now we need to:

1. **Manage expectations**: the follow-up meeting is where we show, not tell. Demos, not decks.
2. **Get sign-off on the plan**: share the deliverables list BEFORE the meeting. Let them validate our direction.
3. **Show the workflow**: the human wants to demonstrate the agentic team workflow itself — how this brief was processed, how the team responded, how fast we moved. The process is part of the product.
4. **Impress with speed**: from meeting to working demos in one week. That's the pace that makes investors believe.

## For the GRC

Two new tasks:

1. **Create the B0–B10 business priority framework** — same structure as P0–P10, but for business opportunities and strategic priorities. Define what each level means, what the response looks like, who's involved.

2. **Create the D0–D10 development priority framework** — same structure, for development resource allocation. D0 = stop everything. D10 = nice to have someday.

3. **Cross-reference all three axes**: every issue, every feature, every work stream should carry all three ratings (P, B, D). A feature might be P5 / B1 / D1 (moderate security relevance, high business priority, maximum dev priority). The three ratings together tell you where to focus.

---

## Status

**OPEN — B3 as B1.** Maximum business and development priority. Follow-up investor meeting to be scheduled for next week.

Primary focus for the next work streams: PKI browser implementation, Claude skill prototype, architecture document, proposal for investor sign-off.
