# SGraph Send: Daily Brief — Next MVP for Friendlies Release

**version** v0.2.16  
**date** 12 Feb 2026  

## Yesterday's Win

We released the first MVP that actually works end-to-end in memory. It's functional and it's real. Great work.

## Today's Focus: The Next MVP

The way to think about this: there isn't ONE MVP. There's a series of minimal viable prototypes that evolve toward minimal viable products. Yesterday was the first. Today we start the next one.

**This MVP's goal**: an end-to-end working solution I can share with the first batch of users — the "friendlies." People I can reach out to, post about on LinkedIn, invite-only flow. Everything needs to be good enough for that.

## Workstream 1: UI and Design Improvements

### Designer review
The current UI is functional but vanilla. I need the **designer** to review and improve it. I'll provide the designer role definition from another project (it's already proven) — just needs adjusting to this project's context. Files will be in the briefing folder.

### What needs to happen

- **Improve the look** — more professional, better polish. The functionality shown yesterday is spot on, we just need it to look the part.
- **Add explanation pages** — help users understand what SGraph Send is. Keep it simple but informative.
- **Top banner or navigation** — sub-pages, top-level navigation. Move beyond a single page.
- **Branding guide** — the designer should create brand guidelines for this project: colour schemes, typography, visual identity.
- **Logo brief** — designer creates a brief that I can give to ChatGPT and other tools to generate a logo. We need proper corporate branding so it looks professional.

### Branding deliverables
1. Brand guidelines document (colours, fonts, spacing, tone)
2. Logo brief (for AI generation)
3. Updated UI mockups applying the new branding

## Workstream 2: Foundation Architecture

These are fundamental building blocks that become very hard to add later. We add them NOW while the app is simple.

### Single Page Application (SPA) support

Convert the backend to SPA routing:

- All requests for a particular path get sent to `index.html`
- Exception: JavaScript, CSS, and other static files render directly from the static folder
- Split the IFD path in the backend: one route for the app, one for static content

The static content is more stable than the app code, so this separation makes sense. And with IFD, we can always sync a particular version of the code with a particular version of the content.

### URL-based navigation

We already mapped this out in the project plan. Implement it now — the multi-page experience needs proper URL routing.

### Multi-language support

Add internationalisation from the start. First additional language: **Portuguese** (because I'm Portuguese). The content structure and translation pipeline need to work now, before the app gets complex.

### Accessibility theming

Add at least one, ideally two, alternative theme modes:

- **High contrast** mode
- **Black and white** mode (for visually impaired users)

Again: add this foundation now. Retrofitting accessibility is always harder.

### Summary of foundations for this MVP

| Foundation | Why now |
|-----------|--------|
| SPA routing | Multi-page experience, clean URLs |
| URL navigation | Proper app feel, shareable links |
| Multi-language | Portuguese first, pipeline established |
| Theme modes | Accessibility from day one |
| Static/app split | Clean architecture, independent versioning |

## Workstream 3: Sharing UX Improvements

### Current state
Users have to copy and paste the ID and secret separately. That's not good enough for friendlies.

### Three sharing modes

**Mode 1: Individual copy/paste** (what we have now)
Copy the ID and secret separately. Keep this as an option — it's the most secure channel separation.

**Mode 2: Single URL with hash**
Generate a URL where:
- The file ID is in the URL path/query
- The secret/key is in the URL **hash fragment** (`#`)

I've confirmed: the hash fragment is NOT sent to the server — it stays in the browser. So the server never sees the secret even if someone shares via this URL. **But: get AppSec to review this and do a threat model to confirm.**

**Mode 3: Email template**
A ready-to-send email with everything in it — the URL (with hash), the individual components, explanation text. Copy the whole thing and paste into email. Also explore the trick to open directly in Gmail and other email providers (mailto: links with pre-filled body).

### Presentation
Find a good UX for presenting these three options — maybe tabs, maybe panels, maybe a block layout. The user should see all three options and understand the trade-offs (security vs convenience).

## Workstream 4: Journalist Website

### The ask
The journalist should now be issuing **daily updates**. Writing daily entries and articles about what we're doing. For that, the journalist needs a website.

### Technical approach
- **Jekyll** hosted on **GitHub Pages** (built-in GitHub support)
- All content for the website must live inside the **journalist's folder** — don't pollute other roles' folders
- Need to figure out the folder layout so Jekyll builds from the journalist's content directory
- This isn't JUST the journalist's blog — it's also the **documentation site**. So it covers: daily updates, project articles, technical documentation, how-to guides.

### Workflow
1. **Journalist** defines what they want from the website — layout, sections, content types
2. **Architect** creates the plan — Jekyll configuration, folder structure, GitHub Pages setup, how to build from the journalist's folder
3. **Dev** implements

### New role: Webmaster (or Marketing?)

We need someone responsible for the website. Two options being considered:

- **Webmaster** — owns the website publishing and maintenance. Makes sense because there are actually TWO websites to maintain: the main SGraph Send app (Lambda-delivered) and the static documentation/blog site (GitHub Pages / Jekyll).
- **Marketing** — we definitely need a marketing role for the friendlies launch. The question is whether marketing and webmaster are the same role or separate.

My leaning: they're separate. The webmaster has enough to do maintaining two websites. Marketing is about strategy, messaging, outreach — different skillset. **Let's discuss and decide.**

## Action Items by Role

### Designer
- [ ] Review current UI and propose improvements
- [ ] Create branding guide (colours, fonts, visual identity)
- [ ] Create logo brief for AI generation
- [ ] Propose updated UI with branding applied and explanation pages

### Architect
- [ ] Map out existing user stories and what's been created so far
- [ ] Design SPA routing for the backend (app vs static split)
- [ ] Design the URL-based navigation structure
- [ ] Design the multi-language content structure
- [ ] Plan the Jekyll website (folder layout, config, GitHub Pages setup)
- [ ] Review the three sharing modes and confirm technical approach

### Dev
- [ ] Implement SPA backend routing (all paths → index.html, except static assets)
- [ ] Implement URL-based navigation in the frontend
- [ ] Add multi-language support (Portuguese as first additional language)
- [ ] Add theme switching (high contrast, black & white)
- [ ] Implement the three sharing modes (individual, URL with hash, email template)
- [ ] Set up Jekyll in the journalist's folder with GitHub Pages

### AppSec
- [ ] **Priority**: Review and threat model the URL hash approach for secret sharing. Confirm that the hash fragment is never sent to the server in all scenarios (redirects, referrer headers, analytics, etc.)

### QA
- [ ] Test SPA routing — all paths resolve correctly, static assets still load
- [ ] Test multi-language switching
- [ ] Test theme modes (high contrast, black & white) for accessibility compliance
- [ ] Test all three sharing modes end-to-end
- [ ] Test the hash fragment security claim across browsers

### Journalist
- [ ] Define what you want from the website — sections, content types, layout
- [ ] Start writing daily updates (content first, website will catch up)
- [ ] Write the first "what is SGraph Send" explanation article

### Conductor
- [ ] Decide: Webmaster and Marketing as separate roles, or combined?
- [ ] Sequence the workstreams — what blocks what? (SPA routing likely blocks multi-page navigation)
- [ ] Track progress toward "friendlies ready" milestone
