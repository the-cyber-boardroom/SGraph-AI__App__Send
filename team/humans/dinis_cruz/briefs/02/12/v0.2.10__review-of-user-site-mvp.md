# Review of user site MVP

## General nodes and observations

- we can't add __init__.py files to any of the test/* folders because a) it break PyCharm test resolution (when clicking on the test execution treeview) , and b) they are not needed
- review all issues in this repo and update the status of work that has been done 'issues-fs list', since it looks like quite a good number has been done

## for issues-fs

these issues need to be handed over to Issues-FS team

- user story: "As a user I should be able to get an quick overview of all issues using a command like: issues-fs stats" - at the moment we can get a full list of issues using 'issues-fs stats' but that starts to be easy to consume once we have a bigger number of issues
- user story: "As a user it should be easy to get a list of all my issues" - look at introducing an area of 'user' or 'current-user' (we need to think where we store this config information, maybe an env var?)
- user story: "As a user I should be able to see what are the work being done in the current workstream and iteration"
- user story: "As a user I should be able to see the priority of the issues"
