# Meet Your Three New Teammates: Advocate, Sherpa, Ambassador

**version** v0.2.16  
**date** 12 Feb 2026  
**audience** All existing roles in the SGraph Send agentic team

## Why Three New Roles?

We have 13 roles that build, test, secure, document, visualise, and orchestrate the product. What we don't have — until now — is anyone who **owns the relationship with the people we're building it for**.

Think about it. The architect designs the system. The dev implements it. The designer makes it look good. The QA makes sure it works. The journalist writes about it. The CISO secures it. But who asks: "do actual humans want this? Can they use it? Are they happy? How do we find more of them?"

That gap is what these three roles fill. They complete the picture — from building the product to actually getting it into the hands of people who need it and making sure it works for them.

## The Gap — Before and After

Here's what our team looked like before, and the blind spots we had:

## The Viral Loop — Why These Roles Are Critical for SGraph Send

SGraph Send has a built-in viral mechanic: every encrypted file sent to a recipient introduces a new person to the product. But that loop only works if every stage is handled:

## What This Means for Each Existing Role

Here's the practical impact — what changes for you:

```
FOR THE ARCHITECT
─────────────────
Before: you made design decisions and hoped they served users
Now:    the ADVOCATE reviews every design decision through the
        user lens, backed by real persona data. Expect to be
        challenged — constructively — on user impact.
        The SHERPA will flag when your decisions create
        user-facing complexity, backed by trail data.

FOR THE DEV
─────────────
Before: you implemented features and fixed bugs
Now:    the SHERPA brings you friction points with real data:
        "users expect X but see Y — trails show 35% abandon here"
        You don't have to guess what users want anymore.
        The AMBASSADOR may also bring growth-critical feature gaps.

FOR THE DESIGNER
─────────────────
Before: you designed UIs based on best judgment
Now:    the ADVOCATE validates your proposals against persona needs.
        The SHERPA validates them against real user behaviour and
        trail data. Two new lenses on everything you create.
        You also collaborate with the AMBASSADOR on market-facing
        materials — landing pages, campaign visuals.

FOR THE QA
───────────
Before: you tested that things worked correctly
Now:    the ADVOCATE defines what personas care about.
        The SHERPA defines what "understandable" looks like
        (not just "functional"). The SHERPA's side-effect
        detection (trail changes after releases) feeds into
        your regression strategy.

FOR THE JOURNALIST
──────────────────
Before: you wrote content and managed the public site
Now:    the AMBASSADOR is your primary strategic collaborator
        for market-facing content. They define positioning;
        you write it. The SHERPA commissions user-facing content
        (tooltips, error messages, explanations). The ADVOCATE
        reviews everything for accuracy of user-facing claims.

FOR THE CONDUCTOR
─────────────────
Before: you sequenced work based on technical dependencies
Now:    the ADVOCATE brings user-priority signals.
        The SHERPA brings ground-level urgency from trail data.
        The AMBASSADOR needs campaign timing aligned with releases.
        Three new inputs to your sequencing decisions.

FOR THE CISO / APPSEC / GRC
─────────────────────────────
Before: security existed in its own domain
Now:    the SHERPA reads attacker trails alongside you — not for
        incident response, but for what attacker behaviour reveals
        about system legibility. A probe that exploits user
        confusion is a UX problem as much as a security problem.
        The ADVOCATE also cares about user privacy risks.

FOR THE DEVOPS
──────────────
Before: you monitored "is the system up?"
Now:    the SHERPA needs "what are users doing?" observability.
        Flow-stage timing, abandonment events, error frequencies,
        retry counts. Expect instrumentation requests for
        user-behaviour telemetry, not just infrastructure health.

FOR THE CARTOGRAPHER
────────────────────
Before: you mapped code dependencies and blast radius
Now:    the SHERPA maps blast radius through user behaviour trails.
        After any change, both views are needed. Collaborate on
        visualisations that show code-level AND behavioural impact
        side by side.

FOR THE LIBRARIAN
─────────────────
Before: you organised project knowledge
Now:    three new data streams to catalogue: the ADVOCATE's
        persona definitions and interview results, the SHERPA's
        friction logs and trail analyses, and the AMBASSADOR's
        competitive intelligence and campaign data.

FOR THE HISTORIAN
─────────────────
Before: you tracked project evolution and decisions
Now:    the ADVOCATE's design-review objections become part of
        the decision record. The SHERPA's trail data shows how
        user behaviour evolved across versions. The AMBASSADOR's
        market positioning shifts over time tell the growth story.

## The Boundary Map — Who Owns What

The most important thing to understand is where the boundaries are. These three roles don't overlap with each other, and they don't overlap with you:

## Summary

Three roles. Three domains. One continuous loop.
