# Briefing: New Roles, New Workstreams, Full Team Activation

**date** 12 Feb 2026  
**from** Human (project lead)  
**to** All roles via Conductor  
**priority** High — this changes the team structure and triggers multiple workstreams  
**version** v0.2.17

## What Just Happened

I've just completed a major planning session that produced the following documents. They are all in the `12/` folder alongside the existing v0.2.16 briefs:

### New Role Definitions (4 new roles)
1. `v0.2.16__role-definition__advocate.md` — **Advocate**: owns the customer entity internally. Accountable for user satisfaction, NPS, persona accuracy. Speaks FOR users in every design decision. Never touches users directly.
2. `v0.2.16__role-definition__sherpa.md` — **Sherpa**: guides individual users through the product. The role that actually touches users — directly (onboarding, support) and indirectly (reading the trails they leave in logs and observability data). Updated with new Trail Observation and Side Effect Detection sections.
3. `v0.2.16__role-definition__ambassador.md` — **Ambassador**: owns growth. Market research, competitive intelligence, outreach campaigns (with budget), viral loop optimisation, community/power user engagement. No hard sales — the product sells itself; the ambassador creates the conditions.
4. `v0.2.16__role-definition__dpo.md` — **DPO (Data Protection Officer)**: owns data protection. UK-focused, ICO as primary regulator, UK GDPR + DPA 2018 + PECR. Legally defined role with independence protections. First tasks: IP address audit across AWS, honest privacy wording, DPIA for Google Analytics.

### Team Introduction Document
5. `v0.2.16__intro__three-new-roles-advocate-sherpa-ambassador.md` — Introduction of Advocate, Sherpa, and Ambassador to the existing team. Includes gap analysis, boundary maps, information flow diagrams, and "what this means for each existing role" section.

### New Brief (6 connected workstreams)
6. `v0.2.16__briefs__dpo-observability-tabletop-synthetic-users-playwright.md` — Covers: DPO role activation, Google Analytics integration, maximum AWS observability, tabletop exercise (total AWS compromise), synthetic users as bellwether, and Playwright-as-a-service (Issues FS zip in/zip out).

## What I Need You To Do

Process this in the following order. Each step should be executed as proper Issues FS work — issues created, linked, assigned to roles, and tracked.

### Phase 1: Catalogue and Orientate

**Librarian**: catalogue all 6 new documents. Create a reading guide that maps out:
- Which documents each role MUST read (not optional — these change their responsibilities)
- Which documents each role SHOULD read for context
- The reading order (role definitions first, then the intro doc, then the brief)
- Cross-references to existing briefs that are affected by these new documents (particularly the v0.1.5 user research brief, the v0.1.5 daily brief on friendlies, and the security/risk briefs)

Produce this as a proper catalogue document in the library.

### Phase 2: Structure and Plan

**Conductor + Architect**: review all 6 documents together. Extract every workstream and iteration. Produce a roadmap that includes:
- The new role activation work (creating folders, ROLE.md files, initial tasks)
- The 6 workstreams from the DPO/observability/tabletop brief
- Dependencies between workstreams (what blocks what)
- A proposed sequencing (what can run in parallel, what must be serial)
- Estimated complexity for each workstream (T-shirt sizes are fine: S/M/L/XL)

This roadmap becomes the master coordination document for everything that follows.

### Phase 3: Create the Infrastructure

**Create the new role folders and ROLE.md files** in the `roles/` directory, alongside the existing roles (appsec, architect, cartographer, conductor, dev, devops, grc, historian, journalist, librarian, qa):

```
roles/
├── advocate/
│   └── ROLE.md
├── ambassador/
│   └── ROLE.md
├── dpo/
│   └── ROLE.md
├── sherpa/
│   └── ROLE.md
```

Each ROLE.md should be derived from the corresponding role definition document, formatted consistently with how the existing roles have their ROLE.md files structured.

Also create the new `users/` top-level folder for synthetic users (as described in the brief):

```
users/
└── (to be populated — the advocate defines personas, QA creates the scripts)
```

### Phase 4: Task Extraction and Assignment

**Every role** should have tasks extracted from these documents. Go through each document's "For the Agents" section and create proper issues/tasks for every role mentioned. This includes:

**New roles — first tasks:**
- **Advocate**: review existing personas, strengthen them, review last 5 design decisions through user lens, establish NPS baseline target
- **Sherpa**: map first-time user journey end-to-end, produce friction map, define trail telemetry requirements, coordinate with DevOps on observability
- **Ambassador**: map competitive landscape for encrypted file sharing, produce competitive intel brief, map the viral loop, define growth metrics and baselines
- **DPO**: IP address audit across AWS, write current-state privacy wording, begin DPIA for Google Analytics, review observability plan for data protection compliance

**Existing roles — new tasks from these documents:**
- **DevOps**: enable maximum AWS observability (scripts, not docs), provide cost estimates, create dashboards, coordinate with DPO on data protection implications
- **Architect**: design Playwright-as-a-service architecture (Issues FS zip in/out), explore zip/SQLite storage, integrate DPO review into design workflow
- **Dev**: implement Playwright service, wire up Google Analytics, implement DSL parser
- **QA**: write Playwright scripts for synthetic users (confusion paths, not just happy paths), define "confused user" test scenarios
- **CISO**: lead tabletop exercise (total AWS compromise), define threat model
- **GRC**: work with DPO on risk analysis for GA and IP logging, update risk register
- **AppSec**: support tabletop exercise, review synthetic user scripts for security implications
- **Designer**: collaborate with sherpa on onboarding flow, work with ambassador on market-facing materials
- **Cartographer**: collaborate with sherpa on change-impact analysis (code blast radius + behavioural trail blast radius), visualise tabletop exercise as a graph
- **Historian**: document this as a version milestone — 4 new roles added, team structure fundamentally changed
- **Librarian**: (already tasked in Phase 1, plus ongoing cataloguing of all new artefacts)

### Phase 5: Trigger Execution

Once the roadmap is approved and tasks are created, trigger execution. The conductor sequences. Roles begin their first tasks. Work starts.

### Phase 6: Journalist Coverage

**Journalist**: this is a significant event in the project's history. Cover it as such:

1. **Event article**: write an article documenting that 4 new roles have been added to the team, why, and what they do. This is the "press release" — what happened, what it means, what changes.

2. **Ongoing coverage**: as tasks from Phase 4 are executed, write regular updates. I want to see:
   - A **daily briefing** (or per-significant-event) that tells me: what was done today, what's in progress, what's blocked, and what's next
   - **Per-workstream updates** as each workstream produces outputs (e.g., "DPO completes IP address audit — here's what was found", "DevOps enables CloudFront logging — here's the cost impact", "Ambassador produces first competitive landscape brief")
   - **Milestone articles** when significant things complete (tabletop exercise results, first synthetic user run, first privacy wording published)

The journalist should be following this the way a beat reporter follows a story — not waiting for things to happen, but actively checking in with roles, asking for status, and packaging updates for me.

## The Big Picture

We're going from a 13-role team that builds and secures the product to a 17-role team that builds, secures, AND takes it to market with full user accountability, data protection compliance, and growth strategy. This is the transition from "building a thing" to "running a product."

The philosophy remains: **MVP across the entire supply chain**. Don't perfect one workstream and leave others unstarted. Get all the plumbing working — even if basic — so that as users arrive, we have total visibility, total control, and total accountability.

Every document I've shared has a "For the Agents" section with specific first tasks. Those aren't suggestions — they're the work. Let's go.
