# SGraph Send: User Research, Personas, and Voice-Mode Interviews

**version** v0.2.16  
**date** 12 Feb 2026  

## The Question: Who Owns the Customer?

As we start marketing and outreach, we need to define who owns the customer experience and who owns the user relationship. For now, this sits with **Marketing**, but we should explore what roles are needed — is one marketing role enough, or do we need sub-roles (product marketing, user research, growth)?

## User Research via Voice-Mode Interviews

### The problem with traditional research

Nobody has time to fill in a massive questionnaire. Forms are painful. Written interviews have terrible completion rates. We need a better way.

### The idea: ChatGPT voice-mode as interviewer

Instead of sending someone a form, send them to a **voice conversation** that interviews them. The workflow:

1. We create a brief with the questions we want answered
2. We build a **custom GPT** with those questions as instructions — the GPT acts as an interviewer
3. The user opens the GPT in voice mode and has a natural conversation
4. The GPT asks the questions, follows up, keeps it conversational
5. When done, the GPT packages the responses into a structured interview summary
6. The user shares the results back to us — ideally via **SGraph Send itself** (nice dogfooding: the user uses our product to send us their feedback)

This is dramatically more humane than a form. It's a conversation, not a chore.

### Two types of questionnaires

**Pre-use: Understanding the market**
- What are the user's needs around file sharing and encryption?
- What are their current pain points?
- What use cases would they find valuable?
- What would they pay for?
- What's their current workflow for sharing sensitive files?

**Post-use: Product feedback**
- What did they think of the experience?
- What worked well?
- What was confusing or friction-filled?
- What would they improve?
- Would they use it again? Would they recommend it?

### Crowdsourcing questions from the team

Before building the interview GPT, ask each agent role: **"If you could ask our users one question, what would it be?"**

- **Architect** and **Designer** would ask about usability and UX
- **Developer** would ask about functionality and technical expectations
- **AppSec** would ask about trust and security perception
- **Journalist** would ask about messaging — did the explanation make sense?
- **Historian** and **Librarian** might ask about comparison to other tools
- **QA** would ask about bugs and unexpected behaviour

Collect these, curate them, build the GPT with the combined question set. This means the interview covers every angle the team cares about.

## Customer Personas

We need to define personas — fictional but representative profiles of our target users.

### What a persona includes

- **Name** — give them a real name, make them feel human
- **Profile** — job title, industry, company size, technical level
- **Scenario** — what situation are they in when they need SGraph Send?
- **Pain points** — what's broken in their current workflow?
- **Needs** — what do they actually want?
- **Behaviour** — how do they discover tools? How do they evaluate? What makes them pay?
- **Objections** — what would stop them from using SGraph Send?

### Why this matters

Personas define market segments. Once we have 3-4 personas, we can:

- Validate product-market fit per segment — does SGraph Send solve THIS person's problem?
- Tailor messaging per segment — the pitch for a CISO is different from the pitch for a freelancer
- Prioritise features — which persona is most underserved? Which is easiest to reach?
- Guide the interview questions — different personas need different questions

### Examples to explore

(The marketing role should flesh these out, but starting points:)

- **The Security-Conscious Professional** — needs to share sensitive docs with clients, worried about email interception
- **The Compliance Officer** — needs provable zero-knowledge sharing for regulatory requirements
- **The Freelancer/Consultant** — shares deliverables with multiple clients, wants something simple and professional
- **The Technical User** — wants API access, CLI tools, programmatic file sharing in workflows

## Product-Market Fit Discovery

The overall goal is to discover product-market fit through:

1. **Define personas** — who are we building for?
2. **Pre-use interviews** — do they have the problem we think they have?
3. **Friendlies release** — give them the product
4. **Post-use interviews** — did we solve the problem?
5. **Iterate** — adjust based on what we learn

This is a continuous loop, not a one-time activity. The marketing role should be running this loop constantly.

## New Roles Discussion

### Marketing (confirmed)
We need a marketing role. They own: personas, market segments, messaging, outreach, the friendlies campaign, product-market fit research.

### Who else?

The voice memo raises the question: is one role enough? Possible sub-roles:

- **User Researcher** — owns the interview process, persona development, feedback analysis
- **Growth** — owns outreach, LinkedIn posts, invite-only flow, conversion
- **Content Marketing** — works with the journalist to create public-facing content

For now: start with one **Marketing** role and expand if needed. Don't over-role before we know what the work actually looks like.

## For the Agents

- **Marketing** (new role): define 3-4 customer personas. Design the pre-use questionnaire. Create the custom GPT brief for voice-mode interviews. Plan the friendlies outreach campaign.
- **Designer**: the personas feed into your UI work. Each persona has different expectations for how the product should look and feel. Review the personas once marketing defines them.
- **Architect**: review the workflow for receiving interview results via SGraph Send. Is the current system ready for that? What would need to change?
- **AppSec**: the interview results will contain user data. Even though it's just opinions, think about how we handle and store it. Privacy considerations.
- **Journalist**: work with marketing on the public-facing content. The personas and user research findings are great material for articles — "who is SGraph Send for?" stories.
- **Conductor**: add marketing to the role roster. Decide whether we need sub-roles now or later. Sequence: personas first, then interview questions, then GPT creation, then outreach to friendlies.
- **All agents**: when asked "what question would you ask our users?", actually answer. Your question goes into the interview GPT.
