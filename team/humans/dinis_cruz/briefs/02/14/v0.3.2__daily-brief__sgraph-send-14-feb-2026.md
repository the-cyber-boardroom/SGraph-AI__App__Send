## The Big News

With last night's push, **we now have a full end-to-end flow**. A user can: open the page, log in with a token, drag and drop a file, click encrypt, copy the link, open a new window, paste the link, and download the file. It works. End to end. For real.

I just watched another user go through this flow. The workflow landed. The token system works. The back end works. This is a genuine MVP.

## User Feedback: Round Two

### "Why are we reinventing WeTransfer?"

That was the immediate reaction. Which is interesting, because it means the file-sharing utility is clear — the user understood what the product does. But the differentiation isn't landing yet. Why would I use this instead of WeTransfer?

This reinforces what we discussed in yesterday's brief: the proposition needs to be easy to understand. "Send a file" is clear. "Send a file securely, with browser-side encryption, zero-knowledge architecture" needs to be communicated in a way that makes the difference from WeTransfer obvious and compelling.

**Advocate**: this is a persona insight. Users immediately compare to what they know. We need to answer "why not just WeTransfer?" in the first 10 seconds of the page. **Ambassador**: this is positioning work. Where do we sit relative to WeTransfer, and what's the one-line differentiator? **Designer + Journalist**: the landing page needs to address this head-on.

### The Big File Sweet Spot

The second piece of feedback is gold: **this becomes really useful for big file transfers.** The user identified this unprompted.

The pain point landscape:
- **Small files** (< 20–30 MB): easy to send via email, Slack, WhatsApp. Not a big pain point.
- **Medium files** (30 MB – 1 GB): annoying but manageable. Email fails, but WeTransfer/Dropbox work.
- **Large files** (1 GB+): genuinely painful. Most services have limits, uploads fail, no retry capability, no integrity checking. This is where the real unmet need lives.

Because we're sending files via S3, we theoretically have no meaningful size limit. That's a differentiator. But to actually deliver on large file transfers, we need:

- A more advanced file uploader with retry capability
- Checksum verification (integrity check that the file arrived intact)
- Progress indication for long uploads
- Possibly chunked/multipart uploads for very large files

**Architect**: add large file transfer capability to the roadmap as a priority. Design the approach — chunked uploads, retry logic, checksum verification. **Dev**: this doesn't need to be built today, but the architecture should support it from the start.

### Unencrypted Mode

Here's a question worth capturing: **should we have a mode where files are sent unencrypted?**

The case for it: this is ultimately a file sharing service. Some use cases — especially inside a company, or for non-sensitive large files — don't need encryption. The user just wants to get a 5 GB file from A to B. The encryption overhead (browser-side processing, key management, copy-the-key workflow) adds friction for zero benefit in that scenario.

The case against: it dilutes the security positioning. "We're the secure file sharing service" is a clear message. "We're the file sharing service that's sometimes secure" is weaker.

**My thinking**: the default should always be encrypted. But an explicit opt-out to "send without encryption" should be available as an option — especially for large files where the pain point is "can you actually make it work?" rather than "is it secure?" This should be a pluggable, configurable option, not a fundamental architecture change.

**Advocate**: review from the user perspective. Would our personas want this? Does it confuse the value proposition? **AppSec**: review from the security perspective. What are the implications of offering an unencrypted mode? **Architect**: ensure the architecture supports this as a pluggable mode without compromising the default-secure posture.

## Ship to Production: IFD Release

We now need to take what we have and ship it to prod. This means an IFD (Iterative Flow Development) release.

The Explorer team (our current team — see Wardley Maps section below) has been iterating on minor versions, building features, figuring things out. Now we need to consolidate what we have into a release that can go to production.

I'll provide more detail on this in a separate document, but the key point for the conductor: **an IFD release to production is now a priority workstream**. This isn't just a deployment — it's a consolidation of everything the Explorer team has built into a stable, deployable version.

## Design Agency Brief

We now have our first external service provider: **a design company is coming on board**. We need to prepare for them.

### What the Designer Role Needs to Produce

The designer role (supported by the architect) needs to create a comprehensive brief for the design agency. This brief should include:

**Context and explanation:**
- What SGraph Send is and what it does
- The project structure — how we're set up, how the agentic team works
- The current state — what exists, what works, what the user experience looks like today
- The problems we know we have — trust communication, simplicity, low friction, clear value proposition

**Design requirements:**
- A logo that works across all our scenarios:
  - Full colour
  - Black and white
  - High contrast (for accessibility themes)
  - Visually-impaired-friendly variants
  - Works at small sizes (favicon, mobile) and large sizes (landing page, presentations)
- A corporate/brand identity — colours, typography, visual language
- Website mockups that focus on the user experience:
  - The "what is this?" first-impression moment
  - The file upload and encryption flow
  - The file download/decryption flow
  - The admin/token management interface
  - How trust, simplicity, and security are communicated visually

**Multi-theme and accessibility constraints:**
This is critical — because we're building multilingual, multi-themed, multi-accessibility from the start, the design must work across all variants:
- Multiple colour themes (Aurora, Glacier, Ember — from yesterday's brief)
- Accessibility themes (dark mode, high contrast, colour-blind friendly)
- Multiple languages (content must be decoupled from design — no text baked into images)

The design agency should understand from the start that we need a design system, not just a single design.

### The Deliverable Format

The brief should also cover logistics:
- How files will be shared (we should use our own file sharing service — the design agency becomes a real user and a source of feedback)
- What format deliverables should be in
- What the review process looks like
- Timeline and milestones

### Presentation

In addition to the written brief, we need a **presentation** that walks the design agency through everything. This is the kickoff deck — visual, clear, and structured so someone outside the project can understand what we're building and why.

**Designer**: you own this brief and presentation. This is your primary deliverable for this workstream. **Architect**: support with technical context — how does the system work, what are the constraints. **Advocate**: ensure the brief communicates the user personas and their needs. **Ambassador**: ensure the brief communicates the market positioning and competitive landscape.

## Agent Access for External Partners

The design agency engagement raises a broader question: **how can external partners talk directly to our agents?**

Imagine a designer at the agency who has a question: "what's the colour palette for the high-contrast theme?" Instead of emailing us and waiting for a human to answer, they could ask a Claude bot that has the project context — the briefs, the role definitions, the design requirements — and get an accurate answer immediately.

This is a workflow worth exploring:
- A Claude session (bot) with the project briefing loaded
- External partners can ask questions and get contextual answers
- The bot knows how to find things in the project structure

**Architect**: research how to implement this. What does a "project-aware Claude bot" look like for external partners? What context does it need? How do we scope its access?

### Slack and WhatsApp Integration

Related research: there are increasingly mature integrations for bots communicating via Slack and WhatsApp. This would be valuable for:
- The human project lead asking questions to the team without opening GitHub or Claude Code Web
- Receiving alerts and status updates
- External partners communicating with project-aware bots

**Architect**: produce a briefing on the current state of Slack and WhatsApp bot integration. How mature is it? What are the options? What would it take to connect a Claude session to a Slack channel or WhatsApp number?

## Issues FS: Start Using It

We have a new Issues FS release that supports the `.issues` flat file format (documented in yesterday's brief to the Issues FS team). This dramatically lowers the barrier to adoption.

**The team should now start using Issues FS.** It's understandable that adoption has been low — the previous format was too complex for agents to maintain easily. The new format is simple: text files where each line is an issue (`Task-1 | status | description`). Issues FS handles loading, visualisation, consistency checking, and connecting the dots.

I'll provide supporting documentation, but the conductor should start incorporating `.issues` files into the workflow immediately. Every workstream should have a `.issues` file tracking its tasks.

**Conductor**: adopt Issues FS for task tracking starting now. Create `.issues` files for active workstreams. **All roles**: when you start a piece of work, create or update the relevant `.issues` file. When you finish, update the status. This is how we track what's happening.

## Wardley Maps: Explorer and Villager Teams

Now that we have a working MVP, we're ready to introduce the next level of team structure, based on Wardley Maps methodology.

### Two Teams, Not Three

We're creating two teams:
- **Explorer Team**
- **Villager Team**

We are NOT creating the Town Planners team yet. That comes later, when we have enough maturity to warrant it.

### The Explorer Team

This is what we have now. The Explorer team is the team that:
- Figures things out
- Creates first versions
- Experiments with approaches
- Does the minor versions in the IFD structure
- Moves fast, breaks things (within reason), discovers what works

Every role we currently have operates in Explorer mode. The briefs I've been writing are Explorer briefs — "try this, build that, see what happens, iterate."

### The Villager Team

This is new. The Villager team takes what the Explorer team has produced and makes it production-ready. Specifically, the Villager team:

- **Does NOT add new features.** The functionality as it exists in the final Explorer version is what the Villager team works with. No feature changes. No scope additions. No "while we're at it" improvements.
- **Does NOT fix bugs** (that's the Explorer team's job — bugs are discovered and fixed during exploration)
- **DOES focus on**: scalability, deployment, performance, reliability, production hardening
- **Creates the IFD release** — the consolidated, stable version that goes to production

The separation is critical: the Explorer team's job is to discover what works. The Villager team's job is to make what works reliable and deployable. If the Villager team starts adding features, the versions go out of sync and the whole IFD model breaks.

### New Roles: Explorer and Villager

I'll provide separate role definitions, but the concept is:

Each existing role (architect, dev, DevOps, QA, etc.) has two modes — their Explorer behaviour and their Villager behaviour. The role definition stays the same, but the team context changes what they focus on:

- **Explorer Dev**: building features, experimenting with approaches, iterating on minor versions
- **Villager Dev**: optimising performance, fixing deployment issues, hardening the code — without changing functionality

The conductor manages which team each role instance is operating in. An agent can be an Explorer Dev in one workstream and a Villager Dev in another.

### Why Now

We have a working end-to-end MVP. The Explorer team proved the concept. Now we need to get it into production reliably. That's the Villager team's job. Without this separation, we'd keep adding features to the Explorer version and never actually ship a stable release.

I'll provide detailed role definitions and team structure in a follow-up document.

## Read Receipts and Multi-Upload (Captured for Roadmap)

From the design agency discussion, two features worth capturing for the roadmap (not for today):

- **Read receipts**: the sender can see when the recipient opened/downloaded the file. We already have some of this in the event data — it just needs to be surfaced.
- **Multi-file upload / folder management**: especially relevant for the design agency use case — an external partner sending multiple files, being able to see what's been uploaded, what's been downloaded, managing a collection of transfers.

Both are natural extensions of what we have. Not urgent, but should be on the roadmap.

**Architect**: capture in the roadmap. **Sherpa**: these are UX features that the trail data would inform — how do users actually manage multiple file transfers?

## For the Conductor

Today marks the transition from "building the MVP" to "shipping the MVP." The Explorer team has proven the end-to-end flow works. Now we need two parallel tracks:

1. **The Villager track**: take what we have and prepare the IFD production release. No new features. Focus on stability, performance, deployment.
2. **The Explorer track continues**: design agency brief, landing page improvements, Issues FS adoption, observability pipeline, all the workstreams from previous briefs.

The design agency brief is time-sensitive — we have a real external partner coming on board and they need a proper briefing. The designer should prioritise this.

Issues FS adoption starts now. Every workstream gets a `.issues` file. This is how we track work from today forward.

The Wardley Maps team structure (Explorer/Villager) will be formalised in a follow-up document. For now, mentally separate "people adding features" from "people preparing the release."

Let's ship this thing.
