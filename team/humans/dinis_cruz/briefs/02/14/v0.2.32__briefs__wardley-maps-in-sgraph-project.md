## Why Wardley Maps

Wardley Maps provide a framework for understanding where components of a system sit on the evolution axis — from genesis (brand new, uncertain, experimental) through custom-built (understood but bespoke) to product (standardised, reliable) to commodity (utility, fully automated).

The critical insight for team structure is that **different evolutionary stages require fundamentally different ways of working**. The people and practices that are excellent at exploring the unknown are not the same people and practices that are excellent at making a product reliable and scalable. Trying to do both with the same team, in the same mode, at the same time, creates friction, confusion, and mediocre results at both ends.

Simon Wardley identifies three team archetypes mapped to the evolution axis:

```
GENESIS          CUSTOM-BUILT          PRODUCT          COMMODITY
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Explorers           Villagers           Town Planners
  
  Discover            Productise          Industrialise
  Experiment          Stabilise           Automate
  Iterate             Document            Commoditise
  Fail fast           Optimise            Scale infinitely
  Move fast           Ship reliably       Run at utility
```

The key dynamic is what Wardley calls the **"theft"** — the villagers take (pinch) what the explorers have built and turn it into a product. The town planners later take what the villagers have productised and turn it into a commodity. Each handover is a deliberate act of taking something from one evolutionary stage and moving it to the next.

## Where We Are: February 2026

We have just completed our first end-to-end MVP. A user can upload a file, encrypt it in the browser, share a link, and the recipient can download and decrypt it. The token system works. The back end works. It's real.

This is the transition point. Up until now, everything has been exploration — figuring out what works, building first versions, experimenting with approaches. The entire team has been operating in Explorer mode.

Now we have something worth productising. The core file-sharing flow works. It needs to be hardened, optimised, documented, and deployed to production reliably. That's a fundamentally different activity from continuing to explore new features.

We need two teams.

### The Evolution Map for SGraph Send

```
Component                    Current Stage       Target Stage (next)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Browser-side encryption      Custom-built        Product
File upload/download flow    Custom-built        Product
S3 storage backend           Custom-built        Product
Token/invitation system      Custom-built        Product
Landing page / UX            Genesis             Custom-built
Admin interface              Genesis             Custom-built
Observability / SA           Genesis             Custom-built
Multilingual support         Genesis             Custom-built
Theme system                 Genesis             Custom-built
Large file transfer          Genesis             Genesis
Design / brand identity      Genesis             Genesis
Issues FS integration        Genesis             Custom-built
Cache service integration    Genesis             Custom-built
```

The components in the top group (encryption, upload/download, S3 backend, tokens) are ready for the Villager team to productise. The components in the bottom group are still being explored. This is why we need both teams operating simultaneously — the Explorers keep pushing the frontier while the Villagers stabilise what's been discovered.

---

## Two Teams, Not Three

We are creating:

- ✅ **Explorer Team** — continues discovering and building
- ✅ **Villager Team** — takes mature components and productises them
- ❌ **Town Planners Team** — not yet. We'll introduce this when components reach commodity stage (fully automated, utility-scale). That's not where we are.

Attempting to create the Town Planners team now would be premature. We don't have anything at commodity stage yet. When we do — when, say, the file transfer pipeline is so well understood and stable that it should be running as a fully automated utility — that's when Town Planners enter.

### The Handover ("Theft")

The Villager team takes the final minor version from the Explorer team and productises it. This is a deliberate handover:

1. The Explorer team declares a set of components "mature enough to productise"
2. The Explorer role briefs the Villager role on what's being handed over — what it does, how it works, what the known limitations are, what the performance characteristics are
3. The Villager team takes ownership of those specific components
4. From that point, those components are frozen functionally — the Villager team optimises, hardens, and deploys, but does not change what they do

If the Explorer team discovers a bug in a handed-over component, the fix goes through the Villager team's process — it doesn't get patched ad hoc by the Explorers.

### Distinct Environments

The two teams operate in **distinct environments**:

- Separate AWS infrastructure (Lambda functions, S3 buckets, CloudFront distributions)
- Separate deployment pipelines
- Separate repos or branches (following IFD methodology)
- Separate release cadences

This separation ensures that Explorer experimentation never accidentally breaks the production environment, and Villager stability work never gets disrupted by Explorer feature changes.

## Role Distribution Across Teams

Not every role has equal gravity in both teams. Some roles are primarily Explorers, some primarily Villagers, and some operate across both:

### Primarily Explorer

| Role | Why Explorer-heavy |
|------|-------------------|
| **Architect** | Designing new components, experimenting with approaches |
| **Designer** | Creating new UX, visual design, user flows |
| **Dev** | Building features, implementing first versions |
| **Journalist** | Covering new developments, writing content for new features |
| **Ambassador** | Market research, positioning, growth experiments |
| **Advocate** | User research, persona development, feedback loops |
| **Sherpa** | Observing user behaviour on new features, trail discovery |

### Primarily Villager

| Role | Why Villager-heavy |
|------|-------------------|
| **DevOps** | Deployment, infrastructure, performance, monitoring |
| **QA** | Testing, regression, stability verification |
| **GRC** | Compliance verification, risk assessment for production |
| **DPO** | Data protection review of production systems |

### Across Both

| Role | Why both |
|------|---------|
| **Conductor** | Orchestrates both teams, manages the handover |
| **CISO** | Security review for both exploration and production |
| **AppSec** | Code security in both contexts |
| **Librarian** | Catalogues and indexes work from both teams |
| **Historian** | Tracks the evolution — what moved from Explorer to Villager and when |
| **Cartographer** | Maps the system at both stages — exploration maps and production maps |

### The Cartographer's Special Role

The Cartographer is central to this entire structure. Wardley Maps are, quite literally, maps — and the Cartographer is our mapping role. The Cartographer should:

- Maintain the Wardley Map of the project (which components are at which evolutionary stage)
- Visualise the Explorer → Villager handover pipeline (what's ready to move, what's in transition, what's still being explored)
- Track movement along the evolution axis over time (the project's maturation trajectory)
- Produce the maps that inform the Explorer and Villager roles about where things stand
- Collaborate closely with the Explorer role (what are we discovering?) and the Villager role (what are we productising?)

The Cartographer is the role that makes the Wardley Maps framework operational rather than theoretical. Without the Cartographer actively maintaining and updating the evolution map, the Explorer/Villager distinction becomes opinion rather than evidence.

## Connection to IFD (Iterative Flow Development)

The team structure maps directly to the IFD methodology:

- **Explorer team** creates **minor versions** — incremental, experimental, building on each other
- **Villager team** creates **major versions** (releases) — consolidated, stable, production-ready

The IFD rule that "you never override the previous version" applies to both teams but differently:
- Explorers maintain version history so they can always roll back an experiment
- Villagers maintain version history so they can always roll back a release

The handover from Explorer to Villager is the IFD consolidation point — the moment where accumulated minor versions get consolidated into a release candidate.

## For the Historian

This is a milestone moment in the project's evolution and should be captured as part of the project narrative:

**The story so far:**
- The project began as a single team operating entirely in Explorer mode
- 13 roles were defined, then expanded to 17 with the addition of Advocate, Sherpa, Ambassador, and DPO
- The team built the first end-to-end MVP — browser-side encryption, S3 storage, token system, file sharing flow
- On 14 February 2026, with the MVP proven, the project introduced Wardley Maps team structure: the single team split into Explorer and Villager teams
- Two new meta-roles (Explorer, Villager) were created to lead each team
- The Cartographer role was identified as the connective tissue between the teams — maintaining the evolution maps that determine what moves from exploration to productisation

**What this means:**
The project is transitioning from "can we build this?" (pure exploration) to "can we ship this?" (exploration + productisation running in parallel). This is the first maturation event — the project growing up from a prototype into a product, while continuing to explore new capabilities.

The historian should capture this transition with the same rigour as a product launch or a major incident — it's a structural change that reshapes how the team operates going forward.

---

## What Comes Next

When components reach full product maturity and are candidates for commoditisation (fully automated, utility-scale, zero-touch operation), we'll introduce the **Town Planners** team. That's the third stage of Wardley Maps team evolution.

For now: Explorers explore. Villagers productise. The Cartographer maps the territory. The Conductor orchestrates both teams. And the project evolves.
