# Explorer Team: First Brief

**version** v0.3.2  
**date** 14 Feb 2026  
**from** Human (project lead)  
**to** Explorer team via Conductor  
**note** This brief is for the Explorer team only. The Villager team is operating independently on the first production release.  

---

## Context

The Villager team has been spun up and is working on productising the first MVP (separate brief, separate repo, separate infrastructure). That means the Explorer team is now free to push forward without worrying about destabilising what's being shipped.

This brief covers the next phase of exploration: static assets and design artefacts, theme MVPs for the design agency briefing, MCP endpoints for agent communication, user feedback mechanisms, and visualisations of the team structure.

---

## Static Assets Repo

We need a new repo for static assets — images, screenshots, infographics, NotebookLM graphics, and other visual materials.

### Why a Separate Repo

The main project repo should stay lean. Visual assets are large, binary, and don't belong alongside code. A separate repo gives us:

- A place to store screenshots of every version (visual history of the product's evolution)
- A place to collect design artefacts, infographics, and marketing materials
- A place to organise images for the website
- Freedom to be messy — this is an Explorer repo, we'll figure out optimisation later

The static assets repo will be added as a **Git submodule** of the main project, so it's accessible but doesn't bloat the primary codebase.

### What Goes In It

- Screenshots of every UI version (the visual timeline of the product)
- Infographics and NotebookLM graphics I've already created
- Design artefacts and explorations
- Images for the website and landing page
- Any visual material the team produces

For now, don't worry about file size optimisation. Get the materials in. We'll optimise for production delivery later (compression, CDN, responsive images, etc.).

### Extracting Knowledge from Existing Materials

There are already a lot of valuable design artefacts scattered across various infographics and NotebookLM outputs I've created. I want us to:

1. **Collect them** into the static assets repo
2. **Analyse each one** — what does it contain, what concepts does it convey, what visual elements are reusable?
3. **Create a semantic knowledge graph** from them — extract the concepts, relationships, and visual patterns into a structured graph
4. I'll share an example from another project where we have a good workflow for extracting semantic graphs from design materials

**Librarian**: lead the cataloguing and analysis of existing materials. **Designer**: review for reusable visual elements and design patterns. **Architect**: review for technical accuracy of any architecture diagrams. **Sherpa + Advocate**: review for user-facing relevance — which materials help explain the product to users?

### Mini Agents for the Repo

We should also set up agents for this repo — role definitions and context so that individual Claude Code Web sessions can work on it directly. This means I can start separate sessions focused on the static assets without needing the full project context.

**Conductor**: set up the basic agent structure for the static assets repo.

## Theme MVPs: Ready Before the Design Agency

The design agency briefing is coming (covered in today's main daily brief). When we brief them, we should already have **working theme MVPs** to show them — not just descriptions of what we want, but actual implementations they can see and react to.

### Three Dimensions of Variation

The UI now has three independent axes of variation that we should be exploring:

```
LANGUAGE          THEME (colours)        LAYOUT
──────────        ──────────────         ──────
English           Aurora (default)       Layout A (current)
Portuguese        Glacier (cool)         Layout B (alternative)
(future: more)    Ember (warm)           Layout C (experimental)
                  Dark Mode              
                  High Contrast          
```

- **Language**: content is different, structure is the same (i18n layer from previous brief)
- **Theme**: colours and visual styling are different, layout is the same (CSS variables)
- **Layout**: the arrangement of elements on the page is different, content and colours are independent

This gives us a matrix of combinations: English + Aurora + Layout A, Portuguese + Glacier + Layout B, English + High Contrast + Layout C, etc. Each combination should work. The design system needs to support all three axes independently.

### What to Build Now

Before the design agency briefing:

1. **At least three colour themes** implemented as CSS variable sets (Aurora, Glacier, Ember — plus Dark Mode and High Contrast as accessibility variants)
2. **At least two layouts** for the main page — different arrangements of the same elements, to show the agency that we're thinking about layout flexibility
3. **A theme switcher** in the UI so the agency can toggle between themes and layouts during the briefing

This doesn't need to be polished. These are exploration MVPs. The design agency will take these as starting points and produce something professional. But having working examples is dramatically more useful than having written descriptions.

**Designer**: lead the theme and layout exploration. Create the CSS variable system and the variant implementations. **Dev**: implement the theme switcher mechanism. **Advocate**: which theme/layout combinations feel right for which personas?

### Quick Wins on Current Design

Once I take screenshots of the current version (going into the static assets repo), there are probably some easy visual improvements we can make immediately — layout tweaks, spacing, typography, basic polish. These are small changes that make the product look more considered before the design agency sees it.

**Designer + Dev**: identify and implement quick visual wins. Follow IFD — each improvement is a new minor version.

## MCP Endpoint: Talk to Any Agent from Any Chat Session

This is an exploration I'm excited about. The idea: **an MCP (Model Context Protocol) endpoint that lets any Claude session (or any LLM chat session) download the context needed to talk to a specific agent/role.**

### The Problem

Right now, to talk to (say) the librarian about the project, I need to be in the Claude Code Web session that has the full project context. But what if I'm in a normal Claude chat, or an OpenAI session, or a different tool? I can't just "talk to the librarian" because that session doesn't have the librarian's role definition, tasks, issues, or project context.

### The MCP Solution

Set up an MCP endpoint that, when queried, provides:

- The project definition
- A specific role's ROLE.md (role definition)
- That role's current tasks and issues (from their Issues FS folder)
- That role's recent work and outputs
- Any other context needed to have an informed conversation with that role

The workflow:

```
ME (in any Claude session):
  "I want to talk to the librarian about the current state of documentation"
     │
     ▼
MCP ENDPOINT:
  Receives: "librarian"
  Returns: project definition + librarian ROLE.md + librarian's issues + 
           librarian's recent outputs + relevant briefs
     │
     ▼
CLAUDE SESSION (now has context):
  "I'm the librarian for the SGraph Send project. Based on my current 
   tasks and recent work, here's the state of documentation..."
```

This is powerful because:
- I can talk to any agent from any chat interface
- External partners (like the design agency) could talk to relevant agents
- Each conversation starts with the **latest** version of the agent's context — not a stale snapshot
- It works with Claude, OpenAI, or any LLM that supports MCP

### What the MCP Endpoint Serves

For a given role, the endpoint should return:

1. **Project definition** — what is SGraph Send, what are we building
2. **Role definition** — the ROLE.md file for that role
3. **Current tasks** — the role's Issues FS data (the `.issues` files, the zip, whatever the current state is)
4. **Recent outputs** — what the role has produced recently (reviews, documents, code)
5. **Relevant briefs** — recent briefs that affect this role

As we add more structure to the roles (Issues FS integration, more detailed task tracking), the MCP endpoint gets richer automatically — it's just serving what's already in the repo.

### Deployment Questions

Where does this MCP endpoint run? Options to explore:

- Lambda function (fits our AWS infrastructure)
- Standalone service
- GitHub-hosted (serving directly from repo contents)

**Architect**: research and design the MCP endpoint approach. What does MCP look like for this use case? Where should it be deployed? How do we keep the context fresh (it should always serve the latest from the repo)? **Dev**: prototype once the architect has a design.

## User Feedback: Talking to Early Adopters

I'm already talking to early users, and we need a structured way to capture and act on their feedback. This is an exploration workstream — figure out the best approach, and once it's mature, the Villager team can productise it.

### What We Need

- A way to **collect feedback** from early users (ratings, comments, impressions, pain points)
- A way to **communicate** with early adopters (updates, new features, requests for testing)
- A way to **track** feedback over time (is the experience improving? Are the same pain points persisting?)
- A way to **close the loop** (user reported a problem → we fixed it → user knows it's fixed)

### Options to Explore

- **In-app feedback widget**: a simple "how was your experience?" prompt after using the service
- **Feedback form**: linked from the thank-you/confirmation page
- **Email follow-up**: using the email sharing feature (from previous brief) to reach users after they've used the service
- **Direct conversation**: for the earliest adopters, personal outreach via the advocate role

**Advocate**: this is your primary workstream. Design the feedback collection approach. What questions do we ask? When do we ask them? How do we store and analyse the responses? **Sherpa**: feedback data is trail data — how does it connect to the behavioural observation you're already doing? **Ambassador**: early adopter feedback feeds directly into market positioning. What are users saying about why they'd use this vs alternatives?

## Visualisations: Team Structure and Wardley Map

Now that we have two teams (Explorer and Villager), it would be great to visualise the structure:

### What to Visualise

- **A Wardley Map** of the SGraph Send project — components plotted on the evolution axis, with the Explorer/Villager boundary visible
- **A team topology diagram** — which roles are in which team, how they interact, where the handover points are
- **The workflow diagram** — how briefs flow down, work flows across teams, debriefs flow up

These visualisations serve multiple purposes: they help the team understand the structure, they're useful for the design agency briefing, and they're valuable content for blog posts and LinkedIn (the agentic team structure is a story worth telling).

**Cartographer**: you own these visualisations. The Wardley Map is your core output — this is exactly what the Cartographer role was designed for. **Designer**: make the visualisations look good. **Historian**: these visualisations capture a moment in the project's evolution — archive them with the version and date.

### Team Topologies Connection

We're essentially implementing a version of Team Topologies (Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais) alongside Wardley Maps. The Explorer team is a **stream-aligned team** (aligned to the flow of new features). The Villager team is a **platform team** (providing the stable production foundation). Visualising this using Team Topologies notation would be a nice complement to the Wardley Map.

**Cartographer + Architect**: explore how Team Topologies maps onto our structure and produce a visualisation.

## For the Conductor

The Explorer team is now operating independently of the Villager team. The main constraint is time-to-design-agency-briefing — the theme MVPs and quick visual wins need to be ready before we brief the design agency.

The MCP endpoint and user feedback workstreams are medium-term explorations — start the research now, prototype when ready, and hand to the Villagers once the approach is proven.

The static assets repo is infrastructure — set it up early so materials can start flowing in. I'll be adding screenshots and existing materials as soon as it exists.

Keep exploring. The Villagers are handling production. Our job is to push the frontier.
