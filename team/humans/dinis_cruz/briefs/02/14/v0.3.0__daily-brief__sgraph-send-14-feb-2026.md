# Daily Brief: SGraph Send — 14 February 2026

**Version:** v0.3.0
**Date:** 14 February 2026
**From:** Dinis Cruz
**Status:** Version bumped from v0.2.41 to v0.3.0 — milestone release

---

## Why v0.3.0

This version marks the completion of the foundational sprint that started with v0.1.3 on 13 February. In two days, the project went from a working-but-minimal encrypted file sharing MVP to a fully instrumented, multi-Lambda, cache-backed, token-managed platform with a complete agentic team of 14 roles. The scope of change justifies a minor version bump.

## Complete Work Summary: 13–14 February 2026

### Phase 1: v0.1.3 Session (13 Feb) — User-Facing Features

**Three UI versions shipped via IFD methodology:**

| Version | What shipped |
|---------|-------------|
| **v0.1.1** | Hash-fragment URLs (single-link sharing), Google Analytics removed |
| **v0.1.2** | Text input mode (encrypt text, not just files), auto-decrypt, SGMETA metadata |
| **v0.1.3** | Full i18n foundation — 4 languages (English, PT-BR, PT-PT, Klingon), 80+ translated strings |

**7 bug fixes:** Text 0-byte bug, auto-decrypt, SGMETA metadata, drop zone missing, language selector active state, hash-change bug, open-in-new-tab link.

**LinkedIn post:** First public product showcase featuring Klingon translation — https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7428147910451638272/

### Phase 2: Architecture Sprint (13 Feb) — Cache Service & Backend

**Cache Service Architecture:**
- Discovered MGraph-AI Cache Service already exists as production PyPI package
- Reduced implementation effort from 25-35 hours to ~8-12 hours
- 5 roles reviewed and approved the approach unanimously
- Decisions D024-D027 updated, D034 (IN_MEMORY + S3 prefix) approved

**Implementation:**
- `Send__Cache__Client` wrapper created — thin integration over existing cache service
- `Service__Tokens` implemented — full token CRUD (create, lookup, use, revoke, list)
- `Service__Analytics__Pulse` implemented — request count monitoring
- `Middleware__Analytics` — raw event recording for every HTTP request
- All schemas migrated to domain-specific Type_Safe primitives (12 files, 90+ changes)
- `Routes__Tokens` and `Routes__Analytics` wired and tested

### Phase 3: Inter-Lambda Communication (13-14 Feb)

**Admin Service Client (Service Registry pattern):**
- `Admin__Service__Client` created for user Lambda → admin Lambda calls
- Service Registry enables code-agnostic deployment (same code for in-memory tests and live Lambda)
- Token validation integrated into user UI transfer routes
- Environment variables wired: `SGRAPH_SEND__ADMIN__API_KEY_NAME/VALUE`

**DevOps fixes:**
- Lambda deploy environment variables corrected
- `CACHE__SERVICE__BUCKET_NAME` wired through CI pipeline
- Lambda dependency imports fixed

### Phase 4: Quality & Process (14 Feb)

**IFD Independence Analysis:**
- Dev root cause analysis: v0.1.x versions are full class copies, not surgical overrides
- Librarian lessons learned: 5 lessons documented
- Decision: Accept current state, fix at v0.2.0 consolidation

**osbot-* Ecosystem Audit:**
- Dev: Complete catalogue of every osbot-* feature used
- Architect: Three-pillar assessment (Type_Safe, Service Registry, Memory-FS)
- 5 recommendations including Safe_Str__Iso_Timestamp type request

**Frontend v0.1.4:**
- IFD bump from v0.1.3 (locked) to v0.1.4 (active)
- LaunchList `widget-diy.js` script removed per Decision 3
- All redirects and config updated

### Phase 5: Decisions Made (14 Feb)

| # | Decision | Status |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | LinkedIn drafts deprioritised | No action needed |
| 2 | Tokens: programmatic in tests, Swagger in prod | Already correct |
| 3 | Remove `widget-diy.js` third-party script | Done |
| 4 | Dependencies pinned; 404/401 = integration tests | Done |

## What's Next: v0.3.0 Priorities

### Priority 1: Admin UI (Starting Now)

The admin Lambda has full backend endpoints but the UI is a placeholder (`"IFD version v0.1.0 will go here"`). Build the admin console:

- **Token Management** — Create tokens (with usage limits), view token list, view token details, revoke tokens
- **Analytics Dashboard** — Pulse view (request counts), raw event browser
- **System Health** — Service info, version display
- **Architecture** — Web Components per IFD methodology, calls admin API endpoints directly, vanilla JS (zero framework dependencies)

The Architect and Dev should design and implement this based on existing guidance:
- Dev brief: `team/roles/dev/briefs/v0.2.41__dev-brief__ui-token-integration-and-service-registry.md`
- IFD guides: `library/guides/development/ifd/`
- Admin config: `sgraph_ai_app_send/lambda__admin/admin__config.py`

### Priority 2: Process & Workflow Improvements

The agentic workflow has proven itself over these two days. Key improvements to codify:
- Brief → role responses → debrief → implementation cycle
- Version-tagged review files with role-based organisation
- Issues FS for task tracking
- IFD for frontend versioning (with lessons learned about independence)

### Priority 3: Production Readiness

- Playwright E2E tests for full transfer cycle
- Smoke tests after deployment
- Landing page content (Journalist copy ready)
- Token gate i18n (F015 — known bug)
