# Brief: Dinis Decisions — 14 Feb 2026

**Version:** v0.2.41
**Date:** 14 February 2026
**From:** Dinis Cruz
**Context:** Responses to open questions from [Final Debrief (v0.2.33)](../../debriefs/02/13/v0.2.33__debrief__v0.1.3-role-reviews-final.md) and [Dev Brief (v0.2.41)](../13/v0.2.41__brief__dev-directives-cache-service-implementation.md)

## Decision 1: LinkedIn Drafts — Deprioritised

**Question:** Review the Journalist's LinkedIn drafts and pick one for tomorrow (Debrief action #3).

**Decision:** Don't worry about the LinkedIn drafts for now. Deprioritised.

## Decision 2: Token Creation Strategy — Tests vs Production

**Question:** How should tokens be created and validated across environments?

**Decision:**
- **In tests and CI:** Create tokens programmatically, the same way as other test data is created (in-memory, via `Service__Tokens.create()` or the admin API)
- **In production (AWS Lambdas):** Dinis creates tokens manually using the Swagger UI
- **Validation rule:** If a token doesn't exist, it is not a valid token. No auto-creation, no fallback, no special handling. The code returns `not_found` / 404.

**Current state:** The existing `Service__Tokens.use()` and `Routes__Tokens.lookup__token_name()` already implement this correctly — non-existent tokens return `{"success": false, "reason": "not_found"}` or HTTP 404. No code changes needed.

## Decision 3: Remove LaunchList Third-Party Script

**Question:** Keep the LaunchList `widget-diy.js` script or self-host? (Debrief action #4, Advocate A-03)

**Decision:** Remove the script. The `getlaunchlist.com/js/widget-diy.js` is not doing much. The HTML form still POSTs directly to `https://getlaunchlist.com/s/zSa8gI` as a standard form submission. Dinis will verify users can still register when live.

**Rationale:** Consistency with the zero-tracking, zero-third-party-scripts principle that motivated Google Analytics removal.

**Action:** Remove `<script src="https://getlaunchlist.com/js/widget-diy.js" defer></script>` from:
- `sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__user/v0/v0.1/v0.1.3/index.html`
- `sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__user/v0/v0.1/v0.1.3/download.html`

The LaunchList form markup stays — only the script tag is removed.

## Decision 4: Dependency Pinning & Integration Tests

**Question:** Pin osbot dependencies and implement 404/401 auth edge-case tests.

**Decision:**
- **Pinning:** Done by Dinis at commit `0d4aec6d701754ae517dc3ff2e81ea9039f6d3ca`
- **404/401 tests:** Agreed. These should be called **integration tests** (not unit tests) because they hit a live server. The existing `tests/integration/test_Smoke__Local_Servers.py` already contains 401 tests (`test__admin__anonymous__rejected`, `test__admin__wrong_key__rejected`) and is correctly placed in `tests/integration/`.

## Summary

| # | Decision | Status |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | LinkedIn drafts deprioritised | No action |
| 2 | Tokens: programmatic in tests, Swagger in prod, non-existent = invalid | Already correct |
| 3 | Remove `widget-diy.js` script | **Action required** |
| 4 | Dependencies pinned; 404/401 = integration tests | Done / already correct |
