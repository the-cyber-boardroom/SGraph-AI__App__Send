## 8. New Roles and Categories

### Accountant (Role #19) — Pending Creation

**Source:** [`v0.4.10__brief__accountant-role-cost-control-financial-flows.md`](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/18/v0.4.10__brief__accountant-role-cost-control-financial-flows.md)

- **Team:** Both Explorer and Villager simultaneously
- **Explorer focus:** Token consumption per workstream, session cost tracking, runaway session detection
- **Villager focus:** AWS cost measurement, cost-per-user/transfer, deployment cost projections
- **Key concept:** Externality accounting — an output that costs X to produce may cost 5.8X in total system consumption
- **Status:** Conductor must create ROLE.md and .issues

### Chaos Agent — Placeholder Only

**Source:** [`v0.4.11__brief__chaos-agent-runbooks-fire-drills.md`](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/19/v0.4.11__brief__chaos-agent-runbooks-fire-drills.md)

- **Not a role yet** — prerequisites unmet (runbooks, monitoring, separate environments)
- **Future:** Inspired by Netflix Chaos Monkey — load testing, failure injection, benign-gone-wrong simulation
- **Never in production** without explicit human authorisation

### Visitor — New Category (Not a Role)

**Source:** [`v0.4.11__brief__guest-visitor-programme.md`](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/19/v0.4.11__brief__guest-visitor-programme.md)

- **Third category** beyond Explorer and Villager: external people who explore the repo
- **First visitor:** Manuel
- **Infrastructure needed:** `team/visitors/` with .claude.md, WELCOME.md, getting-started guides, talk-to-agents instructions, challenges

## 9. Document Health

### Coverage (17–19 Feb)

| Category | Expected | Found | Status |
|----------|----------|-------|--------|
| Source briefs catalogued (17 Feb) | 7 | 7 | Complete |
| Source briefs catalogued (18 Feb) | 6 | 6 | Complete |
| Source briefs catalogued (19 Feb) | 7 | 7 | Complete |
| Explorer team outputs (17 Feb) | 5 substantive + 3 stubs | 8 | Complete |
| Incident dev packs (17 Feb) | 9 (root + 8 sub-packs) | 9 | Complete |
| Villager team outputs (17–19 Feb) | Expected | 0 | **GAP — no Villager activity since 16 Feb** |
| Debriefs (17–19 Feb) | 3 | 0 | **GAP — this index serves as catch-up** |
| Librarian master index | 1 | 1 | This document |

### Key Flags

1. **Ambassador has the largest unprocessed backlog** — 5 `for-ambassador/` documents + tagline strategy + partner manifesto + PQC statement + Surf Security concept + interview quotables + cloud partner research
2. **INC-002 Wave 1 execution has not started** — dispatched on 17 Feb, zero developer/QA/AppSec outputs
3. **Accountant role not yet created** — Conductor action required
4. **Visitor programme infrastructure not yet created** — Librarian action required
5. **Operational runbooks do not exist** — GRC P1 deliverable
6. **Deployment packaging not started** — DevOps P1 deliverable
7. **Finding #1 reclassification to P5 still pending human sign-off**
