## 1. Source Briefs: 19 Feb (Incidents)

| # | Document | Version | Villager Weight |
|---|----------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | [INC-003: Access Token Leak in Shareable Links](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/19/incident/v0.4.12__incident__access-token-leak-in-shareable-links.md) | v0.4.12 | HIGH — deployment pipeline lessons |
| 2 | [INC-004: Dinis Answers to Interview (Data Breach Assessment)](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/19/incident/v0.4.15__incident-004__dinis-answers-to-interview.md) | v0.4.15 | MEDIUM — data protection process awareness |

### INC-003 Summary
Access tokens were embedded in shareable download URLs. Every link shared with a recipient also shared the sender's auth credential. Hotfixed in 100 minutes (13:50–15:30). All IFD versions v0.1.0–v0.1.6 patched simultaneously. 153 tests passing. Zero data compromised — tokens grant platform access only, not file decryption.

### INC-004 Summary
Real credentials (linkedin-user token, transfer ID, decryption key) committed in documentation. P2-as-P1 (confirmed data breach). 30-minute containment. S3 object permanently deleted. Data classified Level 1 (public — name and email only). ICO notification NOT required. Token deliberately left active for controlled experiment.

|---|----------|---------|-----------------|
| 3 | [PKI Strategy and Investor Deployment](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/20/v0.4.17__brief__pki-strategy-and-investor-deployment.md) | v0.4.17 | **CRITICAL** — PKI is now strategic direction |
| 4 | [Business Incident: Investor PKI + Claude Integration](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/20/v0.4.17__business-incident__investor-pki-claude-integration.md) | v0.4.17 | HIGH — new B0-B10 classification, investor deployment |
| 5 | [AppSec Research: Service Worker Trust Anchor](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/20/v0.4.20__appsec-research__service-worker-trust-anchor.md) | v0.4.20 | LOW (Explorer research) |
| 6 | [Dev Brief: Admin PKI Key Management Page](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/20/v0.4.20__dev-brief__admin-pki-key-management-page.md) | v0.4.20 | HIGH — deployed to admin UI, Villager must include in releases |

### Key Context: PKI as Strategic Direction
Investor group validated PKI as "killer feature." PKI moves from feature to strategic direction. New classification axes: B0-B10 (business priority) alongside P0-P10 (security) and D0-D10 (development). "SigSend" emerged as organic brand name from investor conversation.

## 5. Incidents: INC-003 and INC-004

The incident directory was reorganised with a standardised naming convention:

```
library/sgraph-send/incidents/
├── README.md                                          # Incident management structure
├── INC-001__2026-02-12__commit-author-impersonation/  # Renamed from previous
├── INC-002__2026-02-17__first-external-security-disclosure/  # Renamed from 2026-02-17-security-review/
├── INC-003__2026-02-19__access-token-leak-in-urls/
└── INC-004__2026-02-19__documentation-token-leak/
```

**Villager takeaways from incidents:**
1. **IFD simultaneous patching** — all versions v0.1.0–v0.1.6 patched in one hotfix. Villager deployment must support this pattern.
2. **Data breach notification process** — now documented and reusable. Villager team should adopt the same process for production incidents.
3. **100-minute response time** — benchmark for production incident response. GRC runbooks (still unwritten) should target this.
4. **URL sanitisation tests** — new test file `tests/unit/test_url_sanitisation.py` added. Villager QA should include in regression baseline.

---

## 6. PKI Capability: Villager Impact

PKI is now a **deployed production capability** in the admin console. This has direct Villager implications:

### What Was Built (Explorer)

- **pki.html** — standalone key management page (admin UI v0.1.2)
- **pki-manager.js** — 1830-line Web Component for RSA-OAEP key generation, ECDSA signing, IndexedDB storage
- **End-to-end encrypted messaging** with digital signatures (confidentiality + authenticity)
- **4 new API endpoints** planned for key discovery (`POST/GET/DELETE /api/keys`, `GET /api/keys`)

### What the Villager Must Handle

| Area | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Admin UI release** | v0.1.2 includes pki.html, admin-shell, analytics-dashboard, token-manager — all new components |
| **Deployment packaging** | Docker/CloudFormation/PyPI must include admin UI with PKI page |
| **Security posture** | AppSec identified 25 PKI risk findings (2 critical: auth on publish, proof-of-possession) |
| **Auth model transition** | Token-based → PKI-based auth is a GRC risk requiring transition planning |
| **Key discovery API** | 4 new REST endpoints coming — DevOps must deploy, QA must test |
| **QA baseline** | PKI end-to-end verification tests exist — add to regression suite |
| **Business cards** | 4 design variants created (HTML + SVG) — Designer review for next print batch |

---

## 7. Previous Gap Closure

From the [v0.4.12 master index](../26-02-19/v0.4.12__master-index__villager-team-17-to-19-feb.md), these gaps are now closed:

| Previous Gap | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Ambassador 5 `for-ambassador/` docs unreviewed | **CLOSED** | [`v0.4.12__response-to-ambassador-briefs__17-feb.md`](../../../../roles/ambassador/reviews/26-02-19/v0.4.12__response-to-ambassador-briefs__17-feb.md) |
| INC-002 Wave 1 execution not started | **PARTIALLY CLOSED** | INC-003 hotfix deployed (token URL fix), INC-004 contained. Wave 1 P3 fixes in progress. |
| No Explorer team outputs since 16 Feb | **CLOSED** | 35+ documents produced across 8+ roles |
| No debriefs for 17–19 Feb | **CLOSED** | 4 Explorer debriefs produced |
| No Librarian master index since 16 Feb | **CLOSED** | 7 Explorer catalogues/indices produced |

### Still Open (Carried Forward)

| Gap | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Operational runbooks (P0, P1, P2) | **STILL OPEN** | GRC P1 — unwritten since 19 Feb dispatch |
| Accountant role (#19) not created | **STILL OPEN** | Conductor action |
| Visitor programme infrastructure | **STILL OPEN** | Librarian action |
| Deployment packaging (Docker, CF, PyPI) | **STILL OPEN** | DevOps P1 — now also must include PKI |
| Finding #1 reclassification sign-off | **STILL OPEN** | Human decision pending |
| Delete button policy | **STILL OPEN** | AppSec/DPO/GRC |
| No Villager reviews since 16 Feb | **STILL OPEN** | This document is the first Villager review since 16 Feb |

| Update incident directory naming convention in Villager docs | Librarian | 19 Feb — directory reorganised |
| Awareness: delegated token authorization feature (future) | Architect | 19 Feb — feature brief |

### Carried Forward (from previous dispatch, still unactioned)

All tasks from the [v0.4.12 task dispatch](../26-02-19/v0.4.12__master-index__villager-team-17-to-19-feb.md#7-villager-task-dispatch) remain active. Key carry-forwards:

- **GRC**: P0/P1/P2 runbooks — P1 priority, unwritten
- **DevOps**: Dockerfile, CloudFormation, PyPI — P1 priority, not started
- **Conductor**: Accountant role onboarding — not started
- **Librarian**: Visitor programme — not started
- **Ambassador**: Tagline strategy, partner manifesto, PQC statement — not started

## 9. Document Health

### Coverage (19–21 Feb)

| Category | Expected | Found | Status |
|----------|----------|-------|--------|
| Source briefs catalogued (19 Feb incidents) | 2 | 2 | Complete |
| Source briefs catalogued (20 Feb) | 4 | 4 | Complete |
| Source briefs catalogued (21 Feb) | 3 | 3 | Complete |
| Explorer team outputs | 35+ | 35+ | Complete (extensively documented) |

| Incident debriefs | 2 (INC-003, INC-004) | 2 | Complete |
| Villager team outputs (19–21 Feb) | Expected | 0 | **GAP — this is the first** |

### Key Flags

1. **PKI is deployed but not yet in Villager release planning** — admin UI v0.1.2 with pki.html, pki-manager.js (1830 lines) is live
2. **Version jumped from v0.4.12 to v0.5.0** — reflects PKI milestone significance
3. **Incident directory reorganised** — standard naming: `INC-{N}__{date}__{description}/`
4. **25 AppSec PKI findings** — 2 critical items must be resolved before Villager production release
5. **Operational runbooks still P1 and unwritten** — now 3 days overdue from first dispatch
6. **4 new API endpoints coming** (`/api/keys`) — DevOps must plan deployment
7. **Business card designs shipped** — 4 variants in `assets/cards/`, ready for Designer review
