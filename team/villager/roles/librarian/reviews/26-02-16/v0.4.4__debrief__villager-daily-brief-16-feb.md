## Executive Summary

The human has delivered a major Villager daily brief that signals a shift from "we have an MVP" to "we are productising it." The brief covers **five major workstreams**, introduces **one new role** (Translator -- the first Villager-exclusive role), defines **a new process** (daily memo workflow and briefing packs), and commissions **a cross-team research project** (DPO/AppSec/GRC evidence collection).

This is the largest single brief the Villager team has received. It contains 27 tasks across 14 impacted roles, with clear P1/P2/P3 prioritisation.

**The core message:** The MVP is shipped. Now make it professional -- proper environments, proper analytics, proper translations, proper user acquisition.

## Questions for the Human

### Priority Questions (Blocking Work)

1. **Subdomain DNS ownership:** Does the human have direct access to Route 53 for `sgraph.com` and `sgraph.ai`? Or does another party manage DNS? This determines whether DevOps can act directly.

2. **SA pipeline Lambda placement:** Should the SA REST API live on the existing Admin Lambda, or should it be a separate Lambda function? The brief mentions "two Lambda functions" (Public and Admin) but the SA pipeline is a significant new surface area.

3. **Translator ROLE.md creation:** Should the Conductor create the Translator ROLE.md based on the role definition brief, or does the human want to review/approve the ROLE.md before it goes live?

4. **CloudFront log data -- actual sample:** The DPO/AppSec need to examine actual log data to confirm IP addresses are absent. Does the human have a sample log file, or should DevOps pull one from the S3 bucket?

### Clarification Questions (Non-Blocking)

5. **"Klingon" language scope:** The brief says "no full content needed." Should the Translator produce even a few key strings (error messages, button labels) in Klingon for the Easter egg effect, or is the dropdown entry alone sufficient?

6. **Physical card printing:** Does the human have a preferred print vendor, or should the Designer produce print-ready files for any standard vendor?

7. **Evidence pack timeline:** The DPO/AppSec/GRC evidence collection is described as running in parallel. Is there a target date for the articles, or is this open-ended?

8. **Beta invite token format:** The brief mentions `community-beta-001` as an example. Is this the desired token naming convention, or should the Ambassador propose a naming scheme?

## What the Villager Team Should Be Working On Next (Prioritised)

### Priority 1 -- Start Immediately

| # | Workstream | Lead Role(s) | Rationale |
|---|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Subdomain architecture document** | DevOps | Everything downstream depends on environment separation |
| 2 | **Translator ROLE.md creation** | Conductor | New role needs to exist before it can act |
| 3 | **Website translation audit** | Translator | Untranslated English on multilingual pages is a live bug |
| 4 | **CloudFront log pipeline design** | Architect + Dev | First end-to-end SA pipeline -- pattern for all others |
| 5 | **SA REST API design** | Architect | API design gates all implementation work |
| 6 | **IP address verification** | AppSec + DPO | Compliance evidence -- blocks the evidence pack too |

### Priority 2 -- Start This Week

| # | Workstream | Lead Role(s) | Rationale |
|---|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| 7 | pt-BR and pt-PT translations | Translator + Dev | Production quality -- users see untranslated content |
| 8 | Admin UI views (cache browser first) | Dev + Designer | Unblocks debugging everything else in the SA pipeline |
| 9 | Production integration tests | QA | Must exist before deploying to separate environments |
| 10 | Marketing copy for beta invites | Ambassador | Human wants to start distributing access codes |
| 11 | Invite card design | Designer | Physical + digital cards for beta distribution |
| 12 | Briefing pack template | Librarian + Architect | Process improvement that accelerates all future work |
| 13 | DPO/AppSec/GRC evidence collection | Librarian + Historian | Research task -- runs in background |
| 14 | Daily report templates | Journalist + Historian | Be ready when SA pipeline produces data |

### Priority 3 -- Queue for Later

| # | Workstream | Lead Role(s) | Rationale |
|---|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| 15 | User feedback platform research | Sherpa + Ambassador | Research only -- no implementation yet |
| 16 | Token-based routing design | Architect | Architecture only -- Explorer territory for implementation |
| 17 | Identity-linked encryption research | Architect + AppSec | Future roadmap -- capture the pattern, do not build |
| 18 | Automated daily reports | Dev + Journalist + Historian | Depends on SA pipeline and report templates |

## Cost-Effectiveness Assessment

### High Value -- Run These Agents Now

| Agent | Why | Estimated Token Cost |
|-------|-----|---------------------|
| **DevOps** | Subdomain architecture is the single biggest blocker. Every deployment improvement depends on environment separation. | Medium (document production + infrastructure research) |
| **Architect** | SA pipeline design and API design gate all Dev implementation work. Two blocking deliverables. | Medium (design documents) |
| **Dev** | Can begin CloudFront log pipeline once Architect delivers design. In parallel, can wire i18n translations. | High (implementation) |
| **Translator** | New role -- needs to audit the website and begin translations immediately. The translation audit is quick and high-impact. | Low-Medium (audit + translation production) |
| **Librarian** | Briefing pack template and evidence collection. Both are force multipliers. | Low (documentation) |

### Medium Value -- Run When Triggered

| Agent | Why | Trigger |
|-------|-----|---------|
| **QA** | Integration tests depend on environment architecture being defined. | After DevOps delivers subdomain document |
| **AppSec + DPO** | IP address verification depends on accessing actual log data. | After DevOps provides sample log file |
| **Ambassador** | Marketing copy can be produced independently. | Can run now, but not blocking |
| **Designer** | Card design can be produced independently. | Can run now, but not blocking |
| **Conductor** | Coordination needed once multiple agents are active. | After initial plans are in place |

### Low Value -- Stand Down Until Needed

| Agent | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **Journalist** | Daily report templates depend on SA pipeline data format. Wait for Architect. |
| **Historian** | Evidence collection can wait until Librarian has identified the sources. |
| **Sherpa** | No current monitoring to analyse. Wait for SA pipeline. |
| **Cartographer** | Mapping depends on infrastructure being defined. Wait for DevOps. |
| **GRC** | Compliance assessment depends on production change workflow being defined. Wait for DevOps + Conductor. |
| **Advocate** | User documentation depends on features being stable. |

## Process Updates Required

### 1. Daily Memo Workflow

The brief defines a new mandatory workflow for processing human input. The Conductor must add this to `.claude/villager/CLAUDE.md`:

1. Architect + Librarian read first (always)
2. Librarian catalogues (always)
3. Produce a debrief document (always)
4. Impacted roles update themselves (only impacted roles)
5. Human reviews the debrief
6. Clarifications flow back

### 2. Briefing Packs

A new process for packaging work for agents. Key principles:
- Every pack lives in its own dedicated folder
- Minimum viable pack: folder + BRIEF.md + .issues/tasks.issues
- Code context uses method streams (actual code with file paths and line numbers)
- Librarian and Architect lead pack creation

The first pack to create: **CloudFront log pipeline** (workstream-level).

### 3. Translator Role Creation

The Translator is the first Villager-exclusive role. Needs:
- `team/villager/roles/translator/ROLE.md` (derived from the [role definition brief](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/16/v0.4.3__role-definition__translator.md))
- `team/villager/roles/translator/.issues/workstream-translation.issues`

## Cross-References to Explorer Documents (Awareness Only)

The Explorer team received its own daily brief. Villager should be aware of but NOT act on:

1. **Interactive encrypted data workflows** ([brief](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/16/v0.4.4__explorer-brief__interactive-encrypted-data-workflows.md)) -- Future feature that the Translator's human reviewer workflow will eventually use. The Explorer team is prototyping JSON in/out with UI schemas.

2. **Explorer daily brief priorities** ([brief](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/16/v0.4.4__daily-brief__explorer-team-16-feb-2026.md)) -- Explorer continues with UX bug fixes, SA dashboard foundation, upload/download resilience research. The briefing packs and DPO/AppSec/GRC evidence work is cross-team.

3. **Design guidelines and logo brief** -- Already implemented. Villager should ensure all new UI work complies with [design guidelines](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/16/design-brief/v0_3_5__designer__sg-send-design-guidelines.md).
