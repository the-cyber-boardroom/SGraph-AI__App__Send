## 6. Cross-References: Explorer Documents

These documents are maintained by the Explorer team. The Villager Librarian catalogues them for awareness but does not act on them.

### Explorer Role Reviews (15 Feb)

The Explorer team produced 11 action plans on 15 Feb in response to their daily brief. These are catalogued in the [v0.3.12 debrief](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/debriefs/02/15/v0.3.12__debrief__explorer-brief-responses-15-feb.md).

### Explorer Briefs That Impact Villager

| Document | Impact on Villager |
|----------|-------------------|
| [Interactive Encrypted Data Workflows](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/16/v0.4.4__explorer-brief__interactive-encrypted-data-workflows.md) | The Translator's human reviewer workflow will eventually use this feature (JSON forms with approve/edit/reject per translation string). Villager should design the translation pipeline to be compatible with this future capability. |
| [Briefing Packs for Agents](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/16/v0.4.4__briefs__briefing-packs-for-agents.md) | Cross-team process. Villager Librarian and Architect participate in briefing pack creation. The first pack (CloudFront log pipeline) is a Villager workstream. |

## 8. New Role: Translator

### Status: PENDING CREATION

The Translator is the first Villager-exclusive role, defined in [v0.4.3 Translator Role Definition](../../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/16/v0.4.3__role-definition__translator.md).

### What Needs to Be Created

| Artifact | Path | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| ROLE.md | `team/villager/roles/translator/ROLE.md` | Pending |
| Issues file | `team/villager/roles/translator/.issues/workstream-translation.issues` | Pending |

### Key Properties

- **Team:** Villager only (Explorer does not need translation)
- **Mission:** Language translation (en to pt-BR, pt-PT) and audience translation (same content for different personas)
- **Two types of translation:** Language/cultural and audience
- **Supported languages:** English (en), Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR), European Portuguese (pt-PT), Klingon (Easter egg)
- **Pipeline:** Content created in English to LLM translation to human reviewer to corrections to published
- **Cross-cutting:** Touches every other role's output that reaches users
- **Human reviewer requirement:** Non-negotiable -- LLM translation is a draft, human native speaker approves
- **Three-phase evolution:** Internal translation (now) to scale and market entry (near-term) to customer-facing translation product (future)
- **Non-English market hypothesis:** Bigger market opportunity in non-English-speaking countries

### Naming Convention Compliance

All documents in this index follow the `{version}__{description}.md` naming convention with version prefix v0.4.4.

### Broken Links

All relative links in this document and the companion debrief have been verified against the filesystem. No broken links detected.

### Flags and Warnings

1. **Translator ROLE.md missing** -- Must be created by Conductor before Translator can begin work
2. **Architect review placeholder** -- Architect review expected in parallel session; placeholder link included
3. **Version note** -- The Translator role definition uses v0.4.3 (written slightly before the daily brief at v0.4.4). All new documents produced by the Villager team from this point use v0.4.4.
