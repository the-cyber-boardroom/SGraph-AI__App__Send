# QA Review: Part-3 Briefs — Testing Assessment

**version** v0.5.13
**date** 21 Feb 2026
**role** QA
**type** Review — testing requirements for v0.5.10 briefs

---

## Briefs Assigned to QA

| Brief | Key Testing Concern |
|-------|-------------------|
| `investigation__admin-panel-performance` | Root cause analysis for slow localhost performance |

---

## Performance Investigation — Status: BLOCKED

The brief identifies two performance problems:

| Problem | Expected | Actual | Factor |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| Static file latency | 1-50ms | ~800-900ms | ~16-50x slower |
| API call latency | <100ms | 5-10 seconds | ~50-100x slower |

### What We Know

- The test file `tests/qa/local-server/test__bug__local_server_performance.py` was delivered
- The brief requires using `osbot-utils` performance testing framework in **light mode** (1-2 requests, not 50-100)
- Root cause suspects: missing cache headers, auth middleware on static files, full S3 scans, no pagination

### What's Blocking

**Human must provide guidance on `osbot-utils` performance testing utilities** before any work begins. Using the framework incorrectly (default 50-100 request mode) could inflate S3 costs — making the problem worse.

### When Unblocked, the Investigation Plan

1. Baseline: measure all slow endpoints (static + API)
2. Decompose: trace each request through middleware chain, measure at each boundary
3. Zoom in: identify the slow layer, count S3 API calls
4. Root cause: map specific operations causing the delay
5. Correlate: S3 call count vs billing spikes

## Testing Implications for Other Briefs

When the Explorer implements these features, QA will need:

| Feature | Test Type Needed |
|---------|-----------------|
| Data room entry/exit | E2E (Playwright) — encryption/decryption cycle |
| File visualizers (PDF, markdown) | E2E — sandboxed iframe rendering |
| Browser Pod | Unit — SW registration, secret storage, budget enforcement |
| EC2 management | Integration — with LocalStack or dedicated test account |
| Fleet management | Integration — full lifecycle (create, start, stop, terminate) |
| Agent chat | E2E — context loading, LLM call, multi-turn conversation |
| SSH key generator | Unit — key format validation, no network requests after load |
