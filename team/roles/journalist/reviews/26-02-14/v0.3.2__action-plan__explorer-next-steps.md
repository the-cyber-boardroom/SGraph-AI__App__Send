# Journalist Action Plan: Explorer Next Steps

**Version:** v0.3.2
**Date:** 14 February 2026
**Role:** Journalist (Explorer Team)
**Trigger:** [v0.3.2 daily brief](../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/14/v0.3.2__daily-brief__sgraph-send-14-feb-2026.md) -- P2 task: "Address 'why not WeTransfer?' on landing page"
**Previous:** [v0.3.0 response to daily brief](v0.3.0__response-to-daily-brief__14-feb.md)
**Explorer role definition:** [v0.3.2 explorer role](../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/14/v0.3.2__role-definition__explorer.md)

---

## Executive Summary

The v0.3.2 brief crystallises the Journalist's Explorer mission around one central question: **"Why not WeTransfer?"** A real user asked it. The answer must land in 10 seconds on the landing page. This action plan covers the landing page copy, content deliverables for the incoming design agency, the Explorer/Villager transition narrative, an updated content strategy, and the status of all carried-forward items from v0.3.0.

---

## 1. Landing Page Copy (P2) -- "Why Not WeTransfer?"

### 1.1 The Problem

A user watched the full end-to-end flow and immediately asked: "Why are we reinventing WeTransfer?" The product utility was clear -- the differentiation was not. The brief is explicit: the answer must land **in the first 10 seconds** of the page.

The current landing page (v0.1.4) shows only:

```
SGraph Send
Zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing
```

That subtitle is jargon. It tells a security professional everything and a normal user nothing. "Zero-knowledge" is a term of art that most file-sharing users have never encountered.

### 1.2 The Four Differentiators

From the brief and the project's architecture, these are the defensible claims that separate SGraph Send from WeTransfer:

| # | Differentiator | Plain-Language Version | Verifiable? |
|---|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Zero-knowledge encryption** | We cannot read your files. Nobody can, except the person you share the link with. | Yes -- browser-side AES-256-GCM, key in hash fragment, server stores ciphertext only |
| 2 | **No file names on server** | We do not even know what your file is called. | Yes -- original filename is encrypted inside SGMETA, never sent in plaintext |
| 3 | **No size limits (S3-backed)** | Send files of any size. No 2 GB cap. No "upgrade to Pro" gate. | Yes -- S3 backend, theoretical limit is 5 TB per object |
| 4 | **Browser-side encryption** | Your file is encrypted before it leaves your device. Not on our server. In your browser. | Yes -- Web Crypto API, observable in browser dev tools |

Supporting differentiators (secondary messaging):
- Zero cookies, zero tracking, no consent banner
- No account required
- Zero framework dependencies (fast, no supply-chain risk)
- Open architecture (verifiable in dev tools)

### 1.3 Draft Landing Page Copy

The copy below is designed for three reading speeds: the 3-second scan (headline + subhead), the 10-second read (add the three bullet points), and the 30-second deep read (add the comparison or "how it works" section).

---

**OPTION A: Lead with the Problem**

> **Send files that only you and your recipient can see.**
>
> SGraph Send encrypts your files in your browser before they leave your device. Our server stores only ciphertext. We cannot read your files. We do not know their names. We do not track you.
>
> - **Encrypted in your browser.** Not on our server. Your file is encrypted with AES-256 before upload. The decryption key never leaves your device.
> - **We cannot see your files.** The server stores encrypted data. No file names. No plaintext. No exceptions.
> - **No size limits.** Send a 50 KB document or a 5 GB archive. No "upgrade to send larger files" gate.
>
> **WeTransfer sends your files through their servers, in the clear. We do not.**

---

**OPTION B: Lead with the Action**

> **Share any file. Any size. Encrypted before it leaves your browser.**
>
> Drop a file. It is encrypted on your device using AES-256-GCM. Upload the ciphertext. Share the link. Only the person with the link can decrypt it. We never see the plaintext.
>
> - **Your browser encrypts.** Not our server. The decryption key stays with you.
> - **No file names stored.** We do not know what you sent. We cannot tell anyone.
> - **No limits, no tracking, no account.** Zero cookies. No consent banner. No signup wall.

---

**OPTION C: Lead with the Contrast**

> **WeTransfer can read your files. We cannot.**
>
> SGraph Send encrypts every file in your browser before upload. The server only stores encrypted data. No file names. No plaintext. No decryption keys. We could not read your files even if ordered to.
>
> - **Browser-side encryption.** AES-256-GCM via the Web Crypto API. The key never touches our server.
> - **No file names on server.** The original filename travels inside the encrypted envelope, invisible to us.
> - **No size ceiling.** S3-backed storage means your 5 GB video gets the same treatment as your 50 KB PDF.

---

### 1.4 Recommendation

**Option A** for the general landing page. It leads with what the user gets (privacy) rather than how it works (encryption). The contrast with WeTransfer is stated once, at the bottom, as a closing punch line rather than an opening attack. This avoids the "attack ad" tone while still answering the question directly.

**Option C** is stronger for targeted campaigns (security-focused communities, InfoSec landing pages, privacy-advocate outreach). It names the competitor directly, which is confrontational but effective with audiences who already distrust cloud services.

**Option B** is the best fit for developer audiences who care about the mechanism.

### 1.5 The 10-Second Test

For any copy to pass the brief's "10-second" requirement, a visitor must be able to answer three questions after a glance:

1. **What does this do?** -- Send files.
2. **Why is it different?** -- Files are encrypted in my browser. The server cannot read them.
3. **Why should I care?** -- Nobody except my recipient can access the file.

All three options above pass this test. The current landing page ("Zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing") fails it -- it answers question 1 weakly and does not address questions 2 or 3.

### 1.6 Coordination

| Role | Need from Journalist |
|------|---------------------|
| **Designer** | The copy above needs to fit the design agency's layout. Provide all three options so the agency can test which visual treatment works best. |
| **Advocate** | Validate copy against the persona matrix (Section 4 of the [Advocate's v0.2.33 review](../../../advocate/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md)). Does each persona get their answer in 10 seconds? |
| **Ambassador** | Confirm the competitive positioning. The [Ambassador's v0.2.33 review](../../../ambassador/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md) established the "Triple-Zero" position. Does this copy align? |
| **Architect** | Verify that "no size limits" is an accurate claim given the current S3 configuration. Confirm the upper bound. |

---

## 2. Design Agency Content

The v0.3.2 brief announces that a design company is coming on board. The Designer owns the brief and presentation, but the Journalist must supply the written content the agency needs.

### 2.1 Content Deliverables for the Agency

| # | Deliverable | Description | Status |
|---|-------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | **Product description (short)** | 1-2 sentences. For use in headers, social previews, meta descriptions. | Draft below |
| 2 | **Product description (long)** | 2-3 paragraphs. For the agency to understand the product in depth. | Draft below |
| 3 | **Value proposition copy** | The "Why SGraph Send?" messaging, including the WeTransfer contrast. | Section 1 above (three options) |
| 4 | **Feature descriptions** | Plain-language explanation of each key feature. For use in UI sections, marketing pages, help content. | Draft below |
| 5 | **Audience/persona summaries** | Who uses this product and why. Written for a designer who needs to understand the user. | Sourced from the [Advocate's persona review](../../../advocate/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md) |
| 6 | **Tone and voice guide** | How SGraph Send speaks. For the agency's copywriters and visual designers. | Draft below |
| 7 | **Competitor positioning summary** | How we sit relative to WeTransfer, Tresorit, Dropbox Transfer. | Sourced from the [Ambassador's competitive analysis](../../../ambassador/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md), Section 2.1 |

### 2.2 Drafts

**Product Description (Short):**

> SGraph Send is a zero-knowledge encrypted file-sharing service. Files are encrypted in your browser before upload. The server stores only ciphertext. The decryption key never leaves your device.

**Product Description (Long):**

> SGraph Send lets you share files of any size with end-to-end encryption that happens entirely in your browser. When you upload a file, the Web Crypto API encrypts it using AES-256-GCM before it leaves your device. The encrypted file is stored on the server. The decryption key is embedded in the share link's hash fragment -- a part of the URL that browsers never send to the server.
>
> This means: the server stores encrypted data. It never sees the plaintext. It never sees the file name. It never sees the decryption key. Even if the server were compromised, the attacker would get only ciphertext -- useless without the key that only the sender and recipient possess.
>
> SGraph Send uses zero cookies, zero third-party tracking, and requires no account to use. The entire frontend is built with vanilla JavaScript and Web Components -- zero framework dependencies, zero supply-chain risk from third-party libraries.

**Feature Descriptions (for agency use):**

| Feature | Plain-Language Description |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Browser-side encryption | Your file is encrypted on your device using AES-256-GCM before it is uploaded. The encryption happens in your browser using the Web Crypto API -- no plugins, no downloads, no server involvement. |
| Zero-knowledge storage | The server stores encrypted data. It cannot read the file, see the file name, or access the decryption key. By design, the server knows nothing about your file's contents. |
| Hash-fragment key sharing | The decryption key is placed in the URL's hash fragment (the part after the `#`). Browsers never send hash fragments to the server. The key travels in the link but never reaches our infrastructure. |
| No size limits | Files are stored on S3-backed infrastructure. There is no artificial cap on file size. A 5 GB video gets the same treatment as a 50 KB document. |
| Zero cookies, zero tracking | No cookies. No Google Analytics. No third-party scripts. No consent banner -- because there is nothing to consent to. Verifiable by opening your browser's developer tools. |
| No account required | Upload, encrypt, and share without creating an account. Access is managed through invitation tokens, not registration. |
| Multilingual interface | The interface supports multiple languages from day one, including regional variants (e.g., Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese are treated as separate locales). |
| Text encryption | Encrypt and share text (passwords, notes, configuration snippets) with the same zero-knowledge architecture used for files. |

**Tone and Voice Guide:**

| Attribute | Guideline | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Direct** | State facts. Avoid qualifiers ("very", "extremely", "incredibly"). | "We cannot read your files." not "We provide extremely strong encryption." |
| **Verifiable** | Every claim should be checkable by the user. Invite verification. | "Open your browser's dev tools. Check the cookies tab. It is empty." |
| **Technical when useful** | Name the algorithm (AES-256-GCM), the API (Web Crypto), the mechanism (hash fragment). Technical precision builds trust. | "AES-256-GCM" not "military-grade encryption." |
| **Unpretentious** | Avoid marketing superlatives. No "revolutionary", "game-changing", "best-in-class". | "Send files securely." not "The world's most secure file sharing platform." |
| **Playful where appropriate** | Personality is welcome (Klingon translations exist for a reason). But never at the expense of clarity or accuracy. | The Klingon language option is personality. The encryption claims are precision. Do not mix the two registers. |

### 2.3 What the Journalist Still Needs to Produce

| # | Content Item | Depends On | Timeline |
|---|-------------|------------|----------|
| 1 | Final landing page copy (post-design-agency feedback) | Agency wireframes | After agency kickoff |
| 2 | "How It Works" explainer section copy | Architect's verification of claims | Next session |
| 3 | FAQ content (for landing page or help section) | User feedback compilation from Sherpa | Next session |
| 4 | Agency-ready persona narratives | Advocate review of persona summaries | Next session |

## 3. Explorer/Villager Transition Narrative

### 3.1 What Happened

The v0.3.2 brief formally introduces two teams based on Wardley Maps methodology. This is the project's first structural maturation event: the single Explorer-mode team splits into Explorer and Villager.

This is worth communicating for three reasons:
1. It marks a milestone -- the MVP is proven, and the project is growing up
2. It demonstrates the agentic team's ability to adopt real-world organisational patterns
3. It provides a narrative hook for external audiences interested in AI-assisted product development

### 3.2 Internal Narrative

For the team's own documentation and debriefs:

> **The Maturation Milestone**
>
> Since inception, every role in SGraph Send has operated in Explorer mode -- discovering, experimenting, building first versions. The v0.3.2 brief formalises what the working MVP made possible: splitting into two teams. Explorers continue pushing the frontier (landing page, design system, large file transfers, Issues FS). Villagers take what the Explorers built and make it production-grade (IFD release, deployment hardening, performance, monitoring).
>
> This is a Wardley Maps pattern: components that have moved from genesis to custom-built are ready to be productised. The encryption flow, the upload/download cycle, the token system, and the S3 storage backend are all at custom-built stage. The Villager team takes ownership of these. The Explorer team moves on to the components still at genesis: the landing page, the admin interface, the design identity, the theme system, and the large file transfer capability.
>
> The separation is not administrative. It changes what questions each team asks. Explorers ask: "What are we trying to learn?" Villagers ask: "Will this survive production load?" Both are essential. Neither can do the other's job.

### 3.3 External Narrative

For blog posts, LinkedIn, or content that communicates this milestone publicly:

> **Draft: "When Your AI Team Grows Up"**
>
> The SGraph Send project started as a single team of AI agent roles -- architect, developer, security reviewer, quality engineer, journalist, user advocate, and more -- all operating in exploration mode. Building the first version. Figuring out what works.
>
> This week, the team split. Not because something broke, but because something worked.
>
> The end-to-end MVP is proven: browser-side encryption, S3 storage, token-based access, file sharing with a single link. That flow works. It has been tested. Users have completed it successfully.
>
> So now the project has two teams:
>
> - **Explorers** -- continue building new capabilities. The landing page, the design system, large file transfer support, the admin console.
> - **Villagers** -- take the proven MVP and make it production-grade. Performance. Deployment. Monitoring. Stability. No new features.
>
> The names come from Simon Wardley's team topology. Explorers discover territory. Villagers build the settlement. Different skills. Different questions. Both essential.
>
> This is the first time -- that we are aware of -- that an agentic AI team has formally adopted Wardley Maps team structure. The team did not just grow in headcount. It grew in maturity.

### 3.4 Narrative Timing

The Explorer/Villager story should be told **after** the first Villager release ships to production. Before that, it is a plan. After that, it is a result. The Journalist recommends:

1. **Now:** Document the transition internally (this section). Share with the Historian for the project record.
2. **After first Villager release:** Write the external narrative (blog post or LinkedIn) with concrete evidence: "The Explorer team built X. The Villager team shipped it to production in Y days with Z improvements."
3. **Ongoing:** Track the two-team dynamic as a recurring content thread. Each handover from Explorer to Villager is a story about how components mature.

## 4. Content Strategy Update

### 4.1 What Carries Forward from v0.3.0

The [v0.3.0 content strategy](v0.3.0__response-to-daily-brief__14-feb.md) defined 5 story angles and a content calendar. Here is the updated status:

| # | Story | v0.3.0 Status | v0.3.2 Status | Notes |
|---|-------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | "14 Roles, 1 Human, 2 Days" (velocity) | Outlined | **Carries forward** | Now even stronger -- 17 roles, Explorer/Villager split. Update the narrative. |
| 2 | "The Brief-Response-Debrief Cycle" (process) | Outlined | **Carries forward** | Good candidate for the design agency context doc -- explains how we work. |
| 3 | "Why Klingon?" (culture) | Ready to write | **Carries forward, lower priority** | The Klingon post already landed. A follow-up explainer is still worthwhile but not urgent. |
| 4 | "Zero-Knowledge, Zero-Cookies, Zero-Frameworks" (three zeros) | Outlined | **Elevated -- feeds landing page** | The three-zeros message is now the core of the "Why not WeTransfer?" answer. |
| 5 | "Building the Admin Console Live" (building in public) | Outlined | **Carries forward** | Admin console shipped. Story can now be told as a completed build, not a live thread. |

### 4.2 New Stories from v0.3.2

| # | Story | Format | Audience | Priority |
|---|-------|--------|----------|----------|
| 6 | "When Your AI Team Grows Up" (Explorer/Villager transition) | Blog post or LinkedIn | AI practitioners, engineering leaders | P2 -- publish after first Villager release |
| 7 | "The Big File Sweet Spot" (large file transfer positioning) | Landing page section + future blog post | All users, especially enterprise | P2 -- draft messaging now, full story after implementation |
| 8 | "Design Agency Meets Agentic Team" (external partner collaboration) | Blog post series | AI practitioners, design community | P3 -- publish during or after agency engagement |

### 4.3 Revised Content Calendar

| Timeframe | Content | Platform | Depends On |
|-----------|---------|----------|------------|
| **This week** | Landing page copy ("Why not WeTransfer?") -- Options A/B/C | Product (landing page) | Designer review, Architect verification |
| **This week** | Design agency content package (Section 2 above) | Internal deliverable | Designer's agency brief |
| **Week of 17 Feb** | Story 5: Admin console build narrative (completed) | LinkedIn or blog | Admin console screenshots |
| **Week of 21 Feb** | Story 4: "Three Zeros" blog post | Blog + LinkedIn | AppSec verification of zero-cookie claim |
| **After first Villager release** | Story 6: Explorer/Villager transition | Blog + LinkedIn | Villager team ships to production |
| **After large file MVP** | Story 7: "The Big File Sweet Spot" | Blog + landing page update | Architect's large file design |
| **Ongoing** | Story 1: velocity narrative (update with 17 roles) | Blog | Can be written any time |
| **When ready** | Story 3: "Why Klingon?" explainer | Short LinkedIn post | No dependency |

### 4.4 Content Priorities (adjusted for v0.3.2)

1. **Landing page copy** -- the "Why not WeTransfer?" answer. This is the Journalist's primary P2 deliverable.
2. **Design agency content package** -- product descriptions, feature explanations, tone guide. Time-sensitive because the agency engagement is imminent.
3. **Three Zeros blog post** -- deepens the landing page messaging into a full narrative. Feeds the Ambassador's external messaging plan.
4. **Explorer/Villager transition narrative** -- internal now, external after the first production release.
5. **Everything else** -- carries forward to the next sprint.

## 5. Carries Forward -- Status of Previous Items

### 5.1 From v0.3.0 Response

| # | Action from v0.3.0 | Priority | v0.3.2 Status |
|---|---------------------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | v0.3.0 internal release notes | P1 | **Done** (delivered in [v0.3.0 response](v0.3.0__response-to-daily-brief__14-feb.md), Section 1) |
| 2 | LinkedIn post draft (admin console) | P1 | **Deprioritised** per [Decision D031](../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/claude-code-web/02/14/v0.2.41__brief__decisions-14-feb-2026.md). Draft exists but publication is not a current priority. |
| 3 | Content strategy with 5 story angles | P1 | **Done and updated** (Section 4 above) |
| 4 | Key messages document | P1 | **Done** (delivered in v0.3.0 response, Section 5). Key messages remain valid. |
| 5 | Blog post: "14 Roles, 1 Human, 2 Days" | P2 | **Carries forward** -- update for 17 roles and Explorer/Villager split |
| 6 | Blog post: "Zero-Knowledge, Zero-Cookies, Zero-Frameworks" | P2 | **Carries forward, elevated** -- the three-zeros message now feeds the landing page copy and the WeTransfer contrast |
| 7 | Admin console screenshot for LinkedIn post | P2 | **Blocked/deprioritised** -- LinkedIn drafts deprioritised per D031 |
| 8 | Process diagram for "Brief-Response-Debrief" story | P3 | **Carries forward** -- request to Cartographer still pending |
| 9 | Update content calendar with actual publish dates | P3 | **Updated** (Section 4.3 above) |

### 5.2 LinkedIn Status

**Decision D031** (from [v0.2.41 brief](../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/claude-code-web/02/14/v0.2.41__brief__decisions-14-feb-2026.md)) explicitly deprioritised LinkedIn drafts. The Journalist acknowledges this decision and adjusts accordingly:

- The admin console LinkedIn draft (v0.3.0, Section 3) remains available if/when LinkedIn is reprioritised
- No new LinkedIn drafts will be produced unless the human re-prioritises
- The content strategy (Section 4) includes LinkedIn as a platform option for future stories, but no LinkedIn-specific deliverables are on the Journalist's active list
- The Journalist's focus shifts to **landing page copy** and **design agency content** -- both are higher priority and higher impact than social media posts

### 5.3 Release Notes

The v0.3.0 internal release notes (delivered in the previous review) remain current. The next release notes will be produced when the Villager team ships the first IFD production release. The Journalist will coordinate with the Villager team's conductor for that deliverable.

---

## 7. Coordination Requests

| To | Request | Context |
|----|---------|---------|
| **Designer** | Include the three landing page copy options (Section 1.3) in the design agency brief. The agency should test which visual treatment communicates the WeTransfer contrast most effectively. | The copy is ready; the layout and visual hierarchy will determine which option works best. |
| **Advocate** | Review the three copy options against the persona matrix. Does each persona get their "Why not WeTransfer?" answer within 10 seconds? Pay special attention to the "Community Member" emergent persona. | [Advocate's persona review](../../../advocate/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md), Section 4 |
| **Ambassador** | Confirm that the competitive positioning in the copy aligns with the "Triple-Zero" position established in the [Ambassador's v0.2.33 review](../../../ambassador/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md). | The landing page copy is the first place the competitive position becomes user-facing. |
| **Architect** | Verify the "no size limits" claim. What is the actual maximum file size given the current S3 configuration? Is it accurate to say "no size limits" or should we say "up to X GB"? | The claim appears in all three copy options and in the design agency feature descriptions. |
| **Librarian** | Index this action plan in the master index. Note the three landing page copy options as pending review. | -- |
