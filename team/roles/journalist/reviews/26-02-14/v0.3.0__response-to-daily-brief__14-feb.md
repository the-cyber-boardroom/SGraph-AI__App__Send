## 1. v0.3.0 Release Notes (Internal)

### SGraph Send v0.3.0 -- Milestone Release Notes

**Release date:** 14 February 2026
**Version range:** v0.2.24 to v0.3.0
**Sprint duration:** 2 days (13-14 February 2026)

---

#### What Shipped

**User-Facing Features (v0.1.1 through v0.1.4):**

- **Single-link sharing** (v0.1.1) -- Hash-fragment URLs combine the transfer ID and decryption key into one link. Recipients click a single URL to access the file. No more separate key exchange.
- **Text encryption mode** (v0.1.2) -- Users can now encrypt and share text, not just files. Auto-decrypt on recipient page load.
- **SGMETA metadata** (v0.1.2) -- Encrypted metadata travels with the payload, enabling richer recipient experiences.
- **Internationalisation foundation** (v0.1.3) -- 80+ strings translated into 4 languages: English, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), and Klingon. Language selector in UI header.
- **LaunchList widget removed** (v0.1.4) -- Third-party `widget-diy.js` script removed per Decision 3, reducing external dependencies to zero.
- **7 bug fixes** across the v0.1.x series: text 0-byte bug, auto-decrypt, SGMETA metadata handling, drop zone missing, language selector active state, hash-change navigation bug, open-in-new-tab link.

**Backend Infrastructure:**

- **Token management system** -- Full CRUD lifecycle: create tokens with human-friendly names and usage limits, lookup, use (with audit trail), revoke, list. Tokens control access to the file sharing service.
- **Cache service integration** -- MGraph-AI Cache Service provides the storage backend for tokens and analytics. `Send__Cache__Client` wrapper provides clean abstraction.
- **Analytics pulse** -- `Service__Analytics__Pulse` computes request counts over configurable time windows. `Middleware__Analytics` captures raw events for every HTTP request.
- **Inter-Lambda communication** -- `Admin__Service__Client` uses the OSBot Service Registry pattern. User Lambda calls Admin Lambda for token validation. Same code works in-memory (tests) and remote (production) with zero code changes.
- **Schema migration** -- 12 files, 90+ changes. All schemas now use domain-specific Type_Safe primitives from osbot-utils.

**Infrastructure:**

- **Two Lambda functions operational** -- Public (user transfers, UI) and Admin (tokens, analytics, admin console).
- **CI/CD pipeline complete** -- Push to dev triggers: unit tests, tag increment, PyPI publish, parallel Lambda deployment (both admin and user).
- **11 GitHub Actions secrets** configured for both Lambdas including inter-Lambda communication credentials.
- **Environment variables** wired end-to-end: `CACHE__SERVICE__BUCKET_NAME` for admin, `SGRAPH_SEND__ADMIN__BASE_URL/API_KEY__NAME/VALUE` for user.

**Process:**

- **14 AI agent roles activated** -- Full agentic team operational: Conductor, Architect, Dev, QA, DevOps, Librarian, Cartographer, AppSec, Historian, Journalist, Sherpa, Ambassador, Advocate, DPO.
- **IFD methodology** established and stress-tested. Lessons learned documented (v0.1.x versions are full copies, not surgical patches -- accepted for now, fix at v0.2.0).
- **8 debriefs** produced covering all major work streams.
- **20+ decisions logged** (D014 through D034) with full rationale and approval tracking.

## 2. Key Metrics and Achievements to Highlight

### The Headline Numbers

These are the metrics that tell the story of this sprint:

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|
| **452 files changed in 2 days** | Demonstrates the velocity achievable with a coordinated agentic team. This is not sloppy bulk generation -- it includes reviewed code, tested schemas, versioned UI, structured documentation. |
| **14 AI agent roles, all active** | This is not a theoretical org chart. Every role produced deliverables. The Sherpa mapped user journeys. The AppSec audited security boundaries. The Historian recorded decisions. Each role has a review trail. |
| **111+ tests passing, zero mocks** | The test suite runs against real implementations (in-memory stack). No mocking means the tests validate actual behaviour, not assumed contracts. The full stack starts in ~100ms. |
| **50+ commits, 8 debriefs** | Every significant batch of work was summarised for human review. The debrief cycle (brief, role responses, implementation, debrief) ran 8 complete iterations in 2 days. |
| **4 UI versions, 4 languages** | The IFD methodology enabled shipping 4 distinct UI versions with independent feature sets. The i18n system supports 4 languages from day one, including Klingon (a deliberate conversation starter). |
| **Zero framework dependencies** | The entire frontend is vanilla JavaScript and Web Components. No React, no Vue, no Angular, no bundler. The UI loads instantly and has zero supply-chain risk from framework dependencies. |
| **v0.2.24 to v0.3.0** | 17 version increments in 2 days. Each version is a tagged, published PyPI release with a complete deployment. |

### Achievement Narrative

The v0.1.3 to v0.3.0 sprint accomplished something unusual: it built and deployed production infrastructure, user-facing features, backend services, inter-service communication, and process documentation simultaneously -- with a team of AI agents coordinated by a single human.

The key achievement is not any single feature. It is the velocity and coherence of the output. The agentic team pattern works: a human provides direction via briefs, agents produce structured responses, implementation follows, debriefs capture what was delivered, and the cycle repeats. Each cycle took approximately 2-4 hours.

## 3. LinkedIn Post Draft -- Admin Console Milestone

### Draft: "Building an Admin Console with 14 AI Agents"

---

**Post text:**

Two days ago, SGraph Send was a working MVP -- encrypted file sharing, zero-knowledge, browser-side encryption. Functional but bare.

48 hours later:

- 452 files changed
- 4 UI versions shipped (including internationalisation in 4 languages)
- Token management system live (create, use, revoke, audit trail)
- Inter-Lambda communication wired (two AWS Lambda functions talking to each other via Service Registry)
- Analytics pulse monitoring operational
- CI/CD pipeline deploying both Lambdas in parallel
- 111 tests passing -- zero mocks, real in-memory stack

All of this coordinated by 14 AI agent roles: Conductor, Architect, Dev, QA, DevOps, Librarian, Cartographer, AppSec, Historian, Journalist, Sherpa, Ambassador, Advocate, and DPO.

Each role has a defined responsibility, produces structured deliverables, and operates within documented constraints. The human role is clear: set direction, make decisions, review output. The AI roles execute, document, and coordinate.

The admin console is next -- a dashboard for managing access tokens, monitoring usage, and checking system health. The backend endpoints are ready. The deployment pipeline is ready. The 14-role team has already produced their response briefs.

This is not about replacing humans with AI. It is about a human directing a team of specialists that happen to be AI agents. The workflow looks like any well-run engineering team: briefs, reviews, implementations, retrospectives. The difference is that the cycle time is hours, not weeks.

The code is open. The process is documented. Every decision has a rationale. Every review has a version number.

### Post Notes

**Tone:** Factual, not promotional. Let the numbers speak. Avoid AI hype language ("revolutionary", "game-changing", "unprecedented"). The post describes what happened and lets readers draw their own conclusions.

**Timing:** Publish after the admin console has at least a working v0.1.0 UI deployed. The post references the admin console as "next" -- if published too early, it becomes vaporware. If the admin console ships first, adjust the post to say "just shipped" instead of "next".

**Images/media to consider:**
1. Screenshot of the admin console (once built)
2. Screenshot of the CI/CD pipeline showing both Lambda deployments
3. A diagram of the 14 agent roles (if one exists in the cartographer's output)
4. The file diff stats from git (452 files, 48,948 lines added)

**Call to action:** The post ends with the URL. No "sign up" or "try it now" -- just the URL. Let curiosity do the work.

## 4. Content Strategy Update -- Agentic Team Stories

### Stories to Tell

The SGraph Send project has a unique story: a production application built and operated by an agentic AI team. This is the content moat. The encryption technology is strong but not unique (AES-256-GCM is standard). The agentic team process is the differentiator.

#### Story 1: "14 Roles, 1 Human, 2 Days"

**Angle:** The velocity story. How a coordinated team of AI agents, directed by a single human, delivered a complete platform sprint in 48 hours.

**Key details:**
- 452 files changed, 50+ commits
- 8 complete brief-response-implement-debrief cycles
- 14 roles, each with defined responsibilities and deliverables
- The human (Dinis) writes briefs and makes decisions. The agents execute, review, and document.

**Format:** Long-form blog post (1,500-2,000 words) with specific examples of role interactions.

**Audience:** Engineering leaders, AI practitioners, and product managers interested in agentic workflows.

#### Story 2: "The Brief-Response-Debrief Cycle"

**Angle:** The process story. How the agentic workflow actually operates, step by step.

**Key details:**
- Human writes a brief with directives for each role
- Each role produces a structured response (review document with version, date, role header)
- Implementation follows based on role recommendations
- Librarian produces a debrief linking all deliverables
- Human reviews the debrief and writes the next brief

**Format:** Process diagram + explainer (800-1,200 words). Reusable as a methodology guide for others building agentic teams.

**Audience:** AI practitioners building their own agentic workflows.

#### Story 3: "Why Klingon?"

**Angle:** The culture story. How adding Klingon as a translation language was both a test of the i18n system and a deliberate conversation starter.

**Key details:**
- The first LinkedIn post about SGraph Send featured Klingon translation
- It generated engagement because it was unexpected and memorable
- The technical reason: stress-testing the i18n system with a non-Latin script
- The cultural reason: demonstrating that the system is extensible and that the team has personality

**Format:** Short post or thread (300-500 words). Lightweight, shareable.

**Audience:** General tech audience, especially those who appreciate engineering culture.

#### Story 4: "Zero-Knowledge, Zero-Cookies, Zero-Frameworks"

**Angle:** The three zeros. A technical story about what happens when you strip everything away.

**Key details:**
- Zero-knowledge: the server never sees plaintext. Encryption in the browser, decryption in the browser.
- Zero-cookies: no cookies, no tracking, no consent banner. Provably verifiable in the browser.
- Zero-frameworks: vanilla JavaScript and Web Components. No React, no build step, no node_modules.

**Format:** Technical blog post (1,200-1,500 words) with code examples and architecture diagrams.

**Audience:** Developers and security-conscious users who care about minimalism and privacy.

#### Story 5: "Building the Admin Console Live"

**Angle:** The building-in-public story. Document the admin console build from brief to deployed UI, showing each role's contribution.

**Key details:**
- Brief published (v0.3.0 daily brief with directives for all 14 roles)
- Each role responds (architect designs components, dev implements, QA plans tests, sherpa maps user journey, etc.)
- Implementation proceeds with real code changes
- Deployed to production Lambda
- Post-deploy smoke tests verify

**Format:** Thread / series of short posts. One post per milestone (brief published, roles responded, first UI deployed, tests passing, production live).

**Audience:** Anyone interested in AI-assisted development in practice.

## 5. Key Messages: The Sprint in Numbers

### Primary Message

> In 2 days, a team of 14 AI agent roles -- directed by 1 human -- shipped 452 files, 4 UI versions, a token management system, inter-Lambda communication, and a complete CI/CD pipeline for a zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing platform.

### Supporting Messages

**For the velocity narrative:**
> 50+ commits. 48,948 lines added. 17 version increments. 8 complete brief-response-debrief cycles. Each cycle: 2-4 hours from human brief to deployed code.

**For the quality narrative:**
> 111 tests passing with zero mocks. Every test runs against real implementations in memory. The full stack starts in under 100 milliseconds. 28 risk register entries tracked. 20+ architectural decisions documented with rationale.

**For the process narrative:**
> 14 roles, each with defined responsibilities: Conductor orchestrates priorities. Architect designs contracts. Dev implements. QA tests. DevOps deploys. Librarian organises knowledge. Cartographer maps the system. AppSec audits security. Historian records decisions. Journalist communicates. Sherpa guides users. Ambassador manages growth. Advocate represents users. DPO ensures compliance.

**For the technology narrative:**
> Zero-knowledge encryption (AES-256-GCM, Web Crypto API). Zero cookies. Zero framework dependencies. Two AWS Lambda functions. Service Registry pattern for inter-Lambda communication. Memory-FS storage abstraction. Full PyPI package on every commit.

**For the admin console narrative (upcoming):**
> The backend is ready: token CRUD, analytics pulse, middleware event capture. 5 admin API endpoints tested and deployed. The admin console UI is the next deliverable -- a vanilla JS dashboard for managing access tokens, monitoring usage, and checking system health.

### What NOT to Say

- Do not claim "AI built this" -- a human directed it. The AI agents executed.
- Do not claim speed records or "fastest ever" -- let readers compare to their own experience.
- Do not oversell the admin console before it ships -- reference it as the next priority.
- Do not mention Klingon in a serious context -- it works as a standalone story, not as a feature in a technical release note.
- Do not quote test counts without the "zero mocks" qualifier -- 111 tests with mocks would not be impressive. 111 tests against real implementations is.
