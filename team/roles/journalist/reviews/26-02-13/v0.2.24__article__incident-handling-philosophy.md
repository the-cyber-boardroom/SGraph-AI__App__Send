## What Was Produced

A blog post for the Jekyll content site: "Why We Treat Every Incident Like a Crisis"

**Location:** `team/roles/journalist/site/_posts/2026-02-13-why-we-treat-every-incident-like-a-crisis.md`

## Source Material

Distilled from the 5-part incident handling series by Dinis Cruz:

1. P3-as-P1 Philosophy
2. Running P3-as-P1 in Practice
3. Best Time to Fix Things (5x Multiplier)
4. Simulation, Communication, Escalation
5. The Football Team (Practice and Preparation)

## Key Messages

The article reinforces three themes:

1. **Every incident is treated with P1 rigour** — the systemic weakness is the same whether the outcome was minor or critical
2. **Every role is a security sensor** — "how come this was possible?" is the universal question
3. **The zero-knowledge guarantee is verified through practice** — tabletop exercises confirm the architecture holds under stress

## Claims Requiring AppSec Verification

- "Your files are encrypted in your browser before they ever leave your device" — verified by existing AppSec reviews
- "We never have the decryption key" — verified by architecture
- "The attacker finds encrypted blobs they cannot decrypt" — requires confirmation that the pre-signed URL architecture means file content never passes through Lambda

## Audience

External users and potential users. Written in plain language with no internal jargon.
