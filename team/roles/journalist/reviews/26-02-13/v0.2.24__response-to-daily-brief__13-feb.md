## 1. Landing Page Content Plan (P2)

### Brief Directive
> Lead with the utility: **send a file**. The security is what makes it trustworthy, not what makes it useful.

### Content Structure (i18n keys — all content authored through translation layer)

**Hero Section:**
- Headline: "Send files. Simply. Securely."
- Subheadline: "Your files are encrypted in your browser before they leave your device. We never see what you send."
- CTA: drag-and-drop zone (already exists)

**How It Works (3 steps):**
1. "Drop your file" — "Drag a file or paste text. It's encrypted instantly in your browser."
2. "Share the link" — "Copy a single link and send it to your recipient."
3. "They open it" — "The recipient clicks the link. The file decrypts in their browser. Done."

**Trust Section:**
- "Zero-knowledge encryption" — "We store your file, but we can't read it. The encryption key never leaves your device."
- "Built on open standards" — "AES-256-GCM, the same encryption used by governments and banks."
- "Transparency" — "We show you exactly what we store and what we don't."

### Content Constraints
- All strings authored as i18n keys (per D017) — **blocked until i18n module is shipped**
- English (en) first, Portuguese (pt) second
- Short sentences. No jargon. No marketing buzzwords
- Advocate to review: does this work for the defined personas?

## 2. Email Sharing Template (P2)

### "Copy as Text" Template

```
Subject: Secure file for you

Hi,

I'm sending you a file securely via SGraph Send.

Click this link to access it:
{download_url}

The file is encrypted — it decrypts in your browser when you open the link.
No account needed. No app to install.

— Sent via SGraph Send (send.sgraph.ai)
```

### "Open in Gmail" Template (same content, pre-populated)

The template should be:
- Brief (people scan emails, they don't read them)
- Clear about what to do ("click this link")
- Reassuring ("encrypted", "in your browser")
- Branded but not heavy ("Sent via SGraph Send")

### i18n Requirement
Email templates also need translation. The `en.json` and `pt.json` files should include:
- `email.subject`
- `email.body_greeting`
- `email.body_instruction`
- `email.body_reassurance`
- `email.body_signature`

### Ambassador Review
Every shared email is a potential acquisition touchpoint. Ambassador should review:
- Does the email create enough curiosity to explore?
- Is the branding visible but not intrusive?
- Should there be a "What is SGraph Send?" link in the email?

## 3. i18n Content Strategy

### Approach
- All user-facing content authored in English first
- Keys follow dot-notation: `section.subsection.element`
- Keep strings short and translatable (avoid idioms that don't translate)
- Portuguese translation done by project lead (native speaker)
- Future languages: community contribution or professional translation

### Key Categories
| Category | Example Keys | Estimated Count |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Navigation | `nav.home`, `nav.about` | ~5 |
| Upload flow | `upload.*` | ~15 |
| Download flow | `download.*` | ~10 |
| Transparency | `transparency.*` | ~8 |
| Landing page | `landing.*` | ~12 |
| Email templates | `email.*` | ~6 |
| Access gate | `gate.*` | ~5 |
| Errors | `error.*` | ~8 |
| **Total** | | **~70 keys** |

## 4. Domain Messaging Note

The user raised that `.ai` creates confusion. If the domain changes to `.com`, all marketing materials, email templates, and landing page copy need updating. The i18n/template approach makes this easier — domain is a variable, not hardcoded.

Recommend: define `{service_url}` as a template variable in all copy, not a literal string.
