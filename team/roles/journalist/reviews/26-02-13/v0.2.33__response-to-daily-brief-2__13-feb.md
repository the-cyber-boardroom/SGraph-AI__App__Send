## 1. Zero-Cookie Messaging

### The Opportunity

Brief #2 establishes a provable zero-cookie policy (D025). This is not just a compliance simplification -- it is one of the strongest trust signals a privacy product can display. Most websites force users to make a decision about cookies before they can use anything. SGraph Send does not have that friction. The absence of the cookie banner is itself a message.

### Landing Page Copy (Draft)

**Option A -- Declarative:**

> **Zero cookies. Zero tracking. Provably private.**
>
> This site uses no cookies. No tracking scripts. No third-party analytics. Your browser talks to our server -- and that is the entire relationship.

**Option B -- Conversational:**

> **Notice anything missing?**
>
> No cookie banner. No consent popup. No "we value your privacy" wall of text.
>
> That is because this site uses no cookies. None. We do not track you. We do not need to ask permission because there is nothing to permit.

**Option C -- Minimal (recommended for first release):**

> **This site uses no cookies.**

A single sentence. Factual. Verifiable. No overselling. The simplicity of the claim matches the simplicity of the product. This can appear in the footer, in the privacy policy, or as a small badge near the upload area.

**Recommendation:** Start with Option C in the footer and privacy page. Use Option A or B on a dedicated "Our Privacy Promise" page once the transparency panel (D030) is live. The claim gains weight when paired with the transparency panel: "We use no cookies, and you can verify what we do store."

### Privacy Policy Page (Draft)

> ## Cookies
>
> This site uses no cookies. Not first-party, not third-party, not session, not persistent. None.
>
> We do not use Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or any other client-side tracking technology. We do not fingerprint your browser. We do not set localStorage tokens for tracking purposes.
>
> **How is this possible?**
>
> We do not need to identify you to provide the service. You upload an encrypted file. We store it. Someone downloads it. We do not need to know who you are at any stage of that process.
>
> **What about analytics?**
>
> We measure site usage through server-side request logging only. We see that a request was made. We do not see who made it. IP addresses are hashed with a daily rotating salt -- we cannot reverse the hash, and tomorrow's hash of the same IP will be different. See our [Transparency] page for the complete list of what the server records.

**AppSec verification needed:** The claim "We do not fingerprint your browser" must be confirmed. If any future feature uses canvas fingerprinting, font enumeration, or similar techniques, this claim must be updated.

### "How Is This Possible?" Explainer (Draft)

This is a natural question visitors will have. Draft for a dedicated section or FAQ entry:

> **How can a website work without cookies?**
>
> Cookies exist for two reasons: to remember who you are between visits, and to track your behaviour. SGraph Send does neither.
>
> When you upload a file, it is encrypted in your browser and sent to our server. We give you a link. When someone opens that link, the file is decrypted in their browser. The transaction is complete. There is no account. There is no session to maintain. There is no behaviour to track.
>
> Most websites need cookies because they need to know who you are. We built SGraph Send so that we do not need to know who you are. The zero-cookie policy is not a limitation -- it is a design choice that protects your privacy.

## 2. Privacy as Market Differentiator (Ambassador Angle)

### Positioning Strategy

The absence of a cookie banner is itself a marketing message. Every website on the internet has trained users to expect a consent popup. When one does not appear, it creates a moment of surprise. That surprise is an opportunity.

### Comparative Messaging (Draft)

**Tagline options:**

1. "No cookie banner because there are no cookies."
2. "While other services ask permission to track you, we do not track you at all."
3. "The most private thing about our site? What is missing."

**Positioning paragraph (for About page or press materials):**

> Every file-sharing service asks you to accept cookies. Every cloud storage provider tracks your usage. Every "secure" messaging app still knows your email address.
>
> SGraph Send is different. Your files are encrypted in your browser before they reach our server. We cannot read them. We do not track you. We do not use cookies. We do not run third-party analytics. We replaced Google Analytics with server-side request counting that cannot identify individual users.
>
> You do not have to trust our privacy policy. You can verify it. Open your browser's developer tools. Check the cookies tab. It is empty.

**Key insight for the Ambassador:** The "check it yourself" angle is powerful. Privacy claims are usually unverifiable ("we take your privacy seriously" -- how would you know?). SGraph Send's claims are verifiable in the browser's developer tools. This verifiability is the differentiator, not just the privacy itself.

### Competitive Landscape Note

| Service | Cookie Banner? | Third-Party Tracking? | Server Sees Plaintext? |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| WeTransfer | Yes | Yes (GA + others) | Yes |
| Dropbox Transfer | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Firefox Send (discontinued) | Yes (minimal) | No | No (E2E) |
| **SGraph Send** | **No** | **No** | **No** |

**Note:** This table requires factual verification before external publication. The Journalist flags this for fact-checking. The structure is correct; the specific claims about competitors need confirmation.

## 3. Transparency Panel Copy (Advocate Angle)

### Panel Design Copy

The transparency panel (D030) shows users exactly what is stored in their browser's local storage. This is both a feature and a trust signal.

**Panel heading:**

> What is stored in your browser

**Empty state (zero-storage mode -- nothing saved):**

> Nothing. This site stores no data in your browser.
>
> Every session starts fresh. When you close this tab, no trace of your visit remains.

**With optional key cache enabled:**

> You have chosen to save your encryption keys locally. Here is what is stored:
>
> | Item | Purpose | Stored Since |
> |------|---------|-------------|
> | Encryption key (file-abc) | So you can re-access your file without re-entering the key | 13 Feb 2026 |
> | Language preference | To show the site in your preferred language | 13 Feb 2026 |
>
> You can clear any or all of this data at any time.

**Clear button label:**

> Clear all local data

**Clear confirmation:**

> All local data has been cleared. Your browser now stores nothing from this site.

**Zero-storage mode toggle:**

> **Zero-storage mode** -- When enabled, nothing is saved in your browser. Every session is stateless. You will need to re-enter encryption keys each time.
>
> [ ] Enable zero-storage mode

### Advocate Review: Does This Resonate?

The transparency panel targets privacy-conscious users -- our core persona. Observations:

1. **"Opening the hood of a car"** -- The brief's metaphor is exactly right. Privacy-conscious users do not just want to be told nothing is stored; they want to see for themselves. The panel turns a claim into evidence.

2. **The empty state is the strongest message.** When the panel says "Nothing" and the user can confirm it in their browser's dev tools, the trust loop is complete. No other file-sharing service offers this level of transparency.

3. **Tone matters.** The copy should be factual, not congratulatory. Avoid "Great news! We store nothing!" -- that is marketing. "Nothing. This site stores no data in your browser." is journalism. Let the fact speak for itself.

4. **The "stored since" column builds trust.** It tells the user exactly when each item was saved. No hidden state. No ambiguity.

5. **Risk: the panel itself must not store anything to function.** The panel should read from local storage to display its contents but should not write anything. If the transparency panel itself sets a "panel_opened" flag in local storage, the trust is broken. **Flag for Dev: verify the panel implementation has zero side effects.**

## 4. User Perspective Review (Advocate Angle)

### Does the Zero-Cookie Claim Resonate?

For the three core personas identified in earlier briefs:

**Privacy-first professional (primary persona):**
Yes, strongly. This persona actively looks for cookie-free services and checks privacy policies. The zero-cookie claim, combined with the "check it yourself" angle, directly addresses their decision criteria. The transparency panel makes the product self-evidently trustworthy.

**Casual sender ("I just need to send a file"):**
Moderately. This persona may not notice the absence of a cookie banner, but they will notice the absence of friction. No consent popup means faster time-to-task. The privacy benefit is real but experienced as convenience rather than security.

**Developer / technical evaluator:**
Yes, strongly. Developers will verify the claim in dev tools. The verifiability is a feature for this persona. They will check the network tab, inspect local storage, and look for tracking pixels. SGraph Send passes all these checks, which builds trust for recommending it within their organisation.

### Communication Without Being Preachy

**Do:**
- State facts: "This site uses no cookies."
- Provide evidence: "Check your browser's storage -- it is empty."
- Let absence speak: The missing cookie banner communicates more than words.

**Do not:**
- Lecture: "Unlike other services that invade your privacy..."
- Overstate: "The most private service on the internet."
- Moralize: "We believe privacy is a human right." (True, but preachy in a product context.)

The strongest privacy messaging is quiet confidence. The product proves itself. The copy just points to the proof.

## 5. Token Allocation Messaging (Ambassador Angle)

### Context

D028 (human-friendly tokens) and D029 (usage limits) mean that giving tokens to a community is a partnership gesture. The token name is memorable ("community-x"), the allocation is finite (1,000 transfers), and usage is tracked. This is not just access control -- it is community engagement infrastructure.

### Community Token Invitation Message (Draft)

**Email / message to community leader:**

> Subject: SGraph Send -- secure file sharing for [Community Name]
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> We would like to offer [Community Name] access to SGraph Send, our zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing service.
>
> Your community token: **[community-name]**
> Your allocation: **[N] secure file transfers**
>
> Share this link with your community members:
> [URL with token]
>
> Each transfer is end-to-end encrypted in the browser. We never see the contents. No account required. No cookies. No tracking.
>
> When your allocation is used, let us know -- we can discuss extending it.
>
> -- The SGraph Send Team

**Key messaging decisions in this draft:**
- The token name is front and centre (human-friendly, per D028)
- The allocation is stated explicitly (transparency, per D029)
- "When your allocation is used, let us know" -- frames the limit as a relationship touchpoint, not a wall
- No hard sell. The product speaks for itself.

### "You Have Been Allocated X Transfers" UI Messaging (Draft)

**On first visit with token:**

> Welcome. You are using token **[token-name]**.
>
> Your allocation: **[N] transfers remaining** out of [total].

**During use:**

> [N] transfers remaining on token **[token-name]**.

**When nearing limit (10% remaining):**

> You have [N] transfers remaining. Need more? Contact us at [email/link].

**When exhausted:**

> Your allocation of [total] transfers on token **[token-name]** has been used.
>
> Thank you for using SGraph Send. To continue, request a new allocation or visit [pricing/contact page].

**Tone guidance:** The exhaustion message should be grateful, not gating. "Thank you for using SGraph Send" before "request a new allocation." The user's experience of hitting the limit should feel like completing something, not being blocked.

## 6. Status of Brief #1 Content Tasks

The following tasks from the Brief #1 response remain active and are not superseded by Brief #2:

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Landing page copy: "Send files. Simply. Securely." | Drafted (v0.2.24) | Blocked by i18n module (D017). Still valid. |
| Email sharing template (copy-text + Gmail) | Drafted (v0.2.24) | Blocked by i18n module (D017). Still valid. |
| ~70 i18n string keys across 8 categories | Defined (v0.2.24) | Informs Dev's i18n implementation. Still valid. |
| All content blocked by i18n module | Unchanged | D017 remains the gating constraint for all new content |

Brief #2 adds new content tasks (zero-cookie messaging, transparency panel copy, token allocation messaging) that are also blocked by the i18n module for user-facing implementation, but the draft copy can be prepared now.
