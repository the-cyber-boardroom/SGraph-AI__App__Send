## 2. Content Gaps Identified

| Gap | Priority | Rationale |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| Privacy policy | **P0** | DPO requires this before wider rollout. GA and LaunchList disclosures needed. |
| FAQ | P1 | Friendlies will have questions. Reduces support burden. |
| Getting started guide | P1 | Expand the visual walkthrough into a complete guide (send + receive flow). |
| Security architecture deep-dive | P1 | Explains zero-knowledge model, AES-256-GCM, hash-only IP storage. Key differentiator. |
| How the access token works | P2 | Friendlies need to know how to use the token and what it does. |
| Comparison with other tools | P2 | Position against WeTransfer, Firefox Send (defunct), Tresorit Send, OnionShare. |
| Developer documentation | P2 | API reference, self-hosting guide, contribution guidelines. |
| Roadmap / what's next | P3 | Public-facing version of the phase overview. Builds anticipation. |

## 4. Content Principles

1. **Transparency first:** Every article should reinforce the zero-knowledge commitment.
2. **Show, don't tell:** Use screenshots and diagrams wherever possible.
3. **Short and scannable:** Target 500--800 words per article. Use headers, bullet points, tables.
4. **Link internally:** Each article should link to at least one other article on the docs site.
5. **Date-driven:** Publish on a predictable schedule so friendlies know when to check back.

## 5. LinkedIn Content Plan

Following the launch announcement, continue with:

- **Week 1 post:** "Why we chose zero-knowledge encryption" (links to security deep-dive).
- **Week 2 post:** "Building in public -- what we learned shipping in 3 days" (links to incident handling philosophy).
- **Week 3 post:** "How SGraph Send compares to WeTransfer" (links to comparison article).

Each post should drive traffic to docs.send.sgraph.ai and include the LaunchList signup link.
