# v0.2.1 — Journalist Response to MVP Infrastructure Brief

**Version:** v0.2.1
**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Role:** Journalist
**Responding to:** `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/2026-02-10/v0.1.4__briefs__focus-on-mvp-release-infrastructure.md`

## 1. Communications Scope

Once the infrastructure is working, beta users will need clear, trustworthy explanations of:
1. **How it works** — the encryption model, the zero-knowledge guarantee
2. **What we collect** — the transparency model, the data classification
3. **Why it's different** — compared to other file sharing services

The Conductor has approved **Jekyll** as the platform for the Journalist website/content site.

## 2. Content Plan

### 2.1 "How It Works" Page (Priority: P0)

**Audience:** Non-technical beta users
**Tone:** Clear, reassuring, no jargon

**Structure:**
1. You pick a file
2. Your browser encrypts it (the key stays with you)
3. The encrypted file is uploaded (we never see the original)
4. You share the link one way, the key another way
5. The recipient opens the link, enters the key, gets the file

**Visual:** Step-by-step diagram showing what the browser does vs what the server sees. The key visual is: "Your browser encrypts → server sees gibberish → recipient's browser decrypts."

### 2.2 Transparency Explainer (Priority: P0)

**Audience:** Privacy-conscious users
**Tone:** Honest, specific, technical where needed

**Structure:**
1. What we store: encrypted bytes, anonymised metadata, IP hash
2. What we DON'T store: file names, decryption keys, plaintext, raw IPs
3. What you see: the transparency panel shows exactly what was captured
4. How to verify: the data shown in the panel matches what's in storage

### 2.3 "For Developers" Page (Priority: P1)

**Audience:** Technical users, potential contributors
**Tone:** Direct, technical

**Structure:**
1. Architecture overview (two Lambdas, Memory-FS, client-side crypto)
2. API reference (transfer endpoints, admin endpoints)
3. CLI usage
4. Self-hosting guide (Docker, PyPI)
5. Security model details

### 2.4 Blog / Updates (Priority: P2)

**Platform:** Jekyll (Conductor decision D013)
**Hosting:** GitHub Pages or static site on the same infrastructure
**Content cadence:** Post per significant feature or security update

## 3. Jekyll Site Plan

### 3.1 Site Structure

```
journalist-site/
  _config.yml
  _posts/
    2026-02-10-introducing-sgraph-send.md
  _pages/
    how-it-works.md
    transparency.md
    for-developers.md
    security.md
  _layouts/
    default.html
    post.html
  assets/
    css/
    images/
      diagrams/
```

### 3.2 Integration Options

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| Separate repo + GitHub Pages | Simple, independent deploy | Different domain or subdomain |
| Subdirectory in this repo | Single source of truth | Mixes app code and content |
| S3 static site | Same infra as app | More DevOps work |

**Recommendation:** Separate repo (`SGraph-AI__Docs__Send` or similar) deployed to GitHub Pages at `docs.send.sgraph.ai`. This keeps the content independent from the application deployment cycle.

## 4. Key Messages for Beta Launch

### Message 1: Zero-Knowledge Promise
> "SGraph Send encrypts your files in your browser before they're uploaded. The server stores only encrypted bytes — it has no way to read your files, and neither do we."

### Message 2: Transparency First
> "Every transfer shows you exactly what data was captured and what wasn't. No surprises, no hidden tracking."

### Message 3: Open Architecture
> "Self-host it, inspect the code, verify the claims. SGraph Send is designed to be trustworthy through transparency, not trust."
