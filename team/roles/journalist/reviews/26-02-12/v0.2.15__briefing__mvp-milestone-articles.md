## Context

SGraph Send has reached its first major milestone: a working MVP of the user-facing site with end-to-end zero-knowledge encrypted file transfer. Dinis has already shared this on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7427535451630276608/

## Task

**Capture the work done and write articles about this major milestone.**

### What Was Achieved

1. **Full end-to-end encrypted file transfer** working on AWS Lambda
   - File encrypted in browser using AES-256-GCM (Web Crypto API)
   - Encrypted blob uploaded to server via Lambda Function URL
   - Shareable download link generated
   - Decryption key stays with sender (never touches server)
   - Recipient downloads encrypted blob, decrypts in browser with key shared out-of-band

2. **Zero-knowledge architecture** verified
   - Server stores only encrypted ciphertext
   - No file names, no decryption keys, no plaintext on server
   - IP addresses hashed (SHA-256)
   - Transparency panel shows exactly what the server stored and didn't store

3. **Full CI/CD pipeline** operational
   - Push to `dev` → unit tests → version tag → deploy to both Lambda functions
   - ~1.5 minutes from commit to live
   - Test-driven deployment (pytest files, not bash scripts)

4. **Agentic development process**
   - Architecture designed by AI Architect role
   - Backend and frontend built in parallel by two AI Dev agents
   - 44 tests written covering schemas, service, routes, and static pages
   - All coordinated through the role-based team system

### Technical Details for Articles

- **Stack:** Python/FastAPI backend, Vanilla JS + Web Components frontend
- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM, 256-bit keys, 96-bit random IV per file
- **Deployment:** AWS Lambda with Function URLs (no API Gateway)
- **Package:** Published on PyPI as `sgraph-ai-app-send`
- **Code:** ~2,000 lines of application code, 44 passing tests

### Angles to Consider

1. **Zero-knowledge file sharing** — what it means and why it matters
2. **Agentic software development** — how an AI team built a working product
3. **From spec to MVP** — the journey from project brief to working Lambda deployment
4. **Transparency by design** — showing users exactly what the server knows

## Deliverables

1. Article(s): `team/roles/journalist/reviews/26-02-12/v0.2.15__article__mvp-milestone.md`
2. Consider multiple angles/articles if warranted
3. Reference the LinkedIn post for context
