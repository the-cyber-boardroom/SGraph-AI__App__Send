# Journalist Action Plan: Brief Response -- 15 February 2026

**Version:** v0.3.12
**Date:** 15 February 2026
**Role:** Journalist (Explorer Team)
**Trigger:** [v0.3.10 daily brief](../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/15/v0.3.10__daily-brief__explorer-team-15-feb-2026.md)
**Previous:** [v0.3.2 action plan -- Explorer next steps](../26-02-14/v0.3.2__action-plan__explorer-next-steps.md)
**Master index:** [v0.3.10 master index](../../librarian/reviews/26-02-15/v0.3.10__master-index__daily-brief-15-feb.md)

## Executive Summary

The v0.3.10 brief -- the first Explorer-team-specific brief -- delivers three distinct content opportunities. First, a validated privacy-by-design success story (the DPO role prevented IP address capture in AWS logging configuration before it became a problem). Second, the Server Analytics workstream, which introduces a narrative about owning your own analytics instead of handing data to third parties. Third, the three-word key concept, which is a UX idea so intuitive it practically writes its own headline.

This action plan identifies which content to produce now and which to hold until features are implemented. It also reconciles carryover items from the v0.3.2 action plan, where the landing page copy and design agency content remain the Journalist's primary deliverables.

## 1. Content Opportunities from the Brief

### 1.1 Privacy by Design: The DPO Success Story

**What happened:** When the DevOps role configured AWS logging (CloudFront, Lambda, S3 access, CloudWatch), the DPO role -- present in the team through the briefing process -- ensured that **IP addresses and other sensitive data were excluded from the logging configuration from day one**. This was not a retroactive fix. It was not a policy document. It was the DPO's presence in the team preventing the problem before it existed.

**Why this matters for content:** Most organisations bolt privacy on after the fact. A DPO reviews an implementation, finds it captures IP addresses, files a ticket, the engineering team deprioritises it, and three months later there is a GDPR incident. The SGraph Send approach is different: the DPO is in the room (or in the brief) when the configuration is being designed. Privacy is an architectural input, not a compliance checkbox.

**Content angle:** "Privacy by design, not by policy." The story is not about encryption (we have told that story). The story is about operational data -- the logs, the analytics, the infrastructure telemetry -- being privacy-aware by default. The DPO did not write a report. The DPO influenced the configuration. Decision D042 in the master index confirms this.

**Strength of the story:** Very strong. This is a concrete, verifiable example. The AWS logging configuration can be inspected. The absence of IP addresses in the logs can be demonstrated. The DPO's influence can be traced through the brief-response-debrief cycle. This is not a marketing claim -- it is an auditable fact.

**Draft narrative:**

> When we configured AWS logging for SGraph Send -- CloudFront access logs, Lambda execution logs, S3 access logs, CloudWatch -- the Data Protection Officer was part of the conversation. Not after the fact. Not in a review meeting two weeks later. During the configuration itself.
>
> The result: our logging infrastructure does not capture IP addresses. It does not capture personally identifiable information. This was not a remediation. It was a design decision. The DPO's presence in the team brief meant the question "should we capture this?" was asked before the configuration was written, not after it was deployed.
>
> This is what privacy by design actually looks like. Not a policy document. Not a consent banner. A logging configuration that never captures what it should not have in the first place.

### 1.2 Server Analytics: The "Own Your Analytics" Narrative

**What happened:** The brief introduces Server Analytics (SA) as a major Explorer workstream. The architecture is distinctive: instead of sending data to a third-party analytics service (Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Datadog), the project builds its own analytics pipeline using the LETS (Load, Extract, Transform, Save) pattern, storing curated data in the cache service. The vision is a "digital twin" of the AWS environment -- both event-driven data (logs) and collected data (API calls) -- entirely self-hosted and self-controlled.

**Why this matters for content:** This complements the zero-knowledge file transfer story. SGraph Send does not just refuse to read your files; it also refuses to hand its own operational data to third parties. No Google Analytics. No Mixpanel. No Datadog. The analytics are built in-house, stored in the same infrastructure, and visible through the admin UI.

**Content angle:** "What if you owned your own analytics?" The broader narrative is about data sovereignty -- not just for the files users share, but for the operational data the service generates. The zero-cookies claim on the landing page is the user-facing manifestation of this. The SA dashboard is the operator-facing manifestation.

**Strength of the story:** Medium-strong. The concept is compelling, but the implementation is early. The cache service LETS pipeline is live and the first collector is deployed, but the SA dashboard (cache browser, Lambda views, CloudFront viewer) is not yet built. The story is best told when there is a working dashboard to show.

**Draft positioning:**

> SGraph Send has zero cookies, zero tracking, zero third-party scripts. But we still need analytics -- every product does. The difference is who owns them.
>
> Our Server Analytics pipeline collects data from AWS (CloudFront logs, Lambda metrics, S3 access patterns), transforms it through a LETS pipeline, and stores the curated results in our own cache service. No data leaves our infrastructure. No third party sees our traffic patterns.
>
> We are building a digital twin of our own deployment -- not just what happened (event logs), but what things look like (infrastructure state), and what changed (temporal diffs). And every bit of it is privacy-aware from the start (see: no IP addresses in the logs).

### 1.3 Three-Word Keys: The Concept Piece

**What happened:** The brief proposes a UX exploration where users can share encrypted files using three memorable words instead of a complex URL with a hash-fragment key. The concept: upload a file, get (or choose) three words like `sunset-bicycle-ocean`, tell the recipient "go to send.sgraph.com and enter sunset-bicycle-ocean." The three words can derive both the cache lookup ID (to find the file) and the decryption key (to decrypt it).

**Why this matters for content:** This is the kind of feature that makes people stop scrolling. The current file-sharing flow (copy a URL, paste it in a message, recipient clicks the URL) is functional but unremarkable. "Tell them to type sunset-bicycle-ocean" is memorable, shareable, and works in conversations where URLs do not -- phone calls, in-person meetings, voice messages.

**Content angle:** "What if sharing a file was as easy as saying three words?" The story is about reducing the friction of encrypted file sharing to the point where it becomes conversational. The security trade-off (three dictionary words have less entropy than a 256-bit key) is honest and worth acknowledging -- not every file transfer needs maximum cryptographic strength. Sometimes you just want to say three words over the phone.

**Strength of the story:** Strong concept, but implementation is blocked. Decision D040 requires a security review from AppSec before any development begins. The Architect needs to determine whether the same three words can serve both lookup and decryption, or if they must be separated. The Journalist should not publish content about this feature until the security review is complete and the concept is confirmed as feasible.

**Draft headline and hook (for future use):**

> **What if sharing a file was as easy as saying three words?**
>
> Encrypted file sharing usually means copying a long URL, pasting it somewhere, hoping the recipient clicks the right link. What if instead you could just say: "Go to send.sgraph.com. Enter sunset-bicycle-ocean." Three words. That is the password. That is the lookup. That is the decryption key.
>
> We are exploring three-word keys for SGraph Send. The idea is simple: replace complex URLs and hash fragments with three memorable words that are easy to say, easy to remember, and easy to type.

**Editorial note:** The brief flags a need to check trademark and patent status of "What Three Words" and similar concepts. The Journalist must avoid any naming or framing that could create a trademark conflict. The three-word concept should have its own brand language if it proceeds. Suggested internal working name: "Passphrase Keys" or "Word Keys" -- neutral terms that describe the mechanism without referencing any existing brand.

## 2. Carryover from v0.3.2 Action Plan

### 2.1 Landing Page Copy

**Status:** Three draft options (A, B, C) were delivered in the [v0.3.2 action plan](../26-02-14/v0.3.2__action-plan__explorer-next-steps.md), Section 1.3. These address the "Why not WeTransfer?" question. No feedback has been received yet from the Designer, Advocate, or Ambassador.

**Action:** The copy remains ready for review. The design agency brief has been produced by the Designer (see `team/roles/designer/reviews/26-02-15/v0.3.3__brief__cruz-and-cruz-design-agency.md`). The Journalist should confirm that the three copy options were included in the agency brief package. If not, provide them to the Designer for inclusion.

**Priority:** Unchanged. The landing page copy is still the Journalist's primary P2 deliverable. The v0.3.10 brief does not supersede this -- it adds new content opportunities alongside it.

### 2.2 Content Calendar

**Status:** The content calendar from v0.3.2 (Section 4.3) remains current. No items were published this week. The calendar is reproduced below with updated status:

| Timeframe | Content | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| This week (ending 15 Feb) | Landing page copy -- Options A/B/C | **Delivered** (in v0.3.2 action plan). Awaiting review. |
| This week | Design agency content package | **Delivered** (in v0.3.2 action plan, Section 2). Agency brief now produced by Designer. |
| Week of 17 Feb | Admin console build narrative | **Ready to write** -- admin console shipped, screenshots available. |
| Week of 21 Feb | "Three Zeros" blog post | **Pending** -- AppSec verification of zero-cookie claim still needed. |
| After first Villager release | Explorer/Villager transition post | **Waiting** -- Villager team has not yet shipped. |

### 2.3 LinkedIn -- Deprioritised per D031

**Status:** Unchanged. Decision D031 (from the [v0.2.41 decisions brief](../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/claude-code-web/02/14/v0.2.41__brief__decisions-14-feb-2026.md)) explicitly deprioritised LinkedIn drafts. The Journalist continues to hold the admin console LinkedIn draft in reserve. No new LinkedIn-specific content will be produced unless the human re-prioritises.

### 2.4 Items Still Pending from v0.3.2

| # | Item | v0.3.2 Priority | 15 Feb Status |
|---|------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | "How It Works" explainer section for landing page | P2 | **Pending** -- needs Architect verification of claims |
| 2 | FAQ content for landing page | P3 | **Pending** -- needs Sherpa's compiled user feedback |
| 3 | "Three Zeros" blog post (full draft) | P2 | **Pending** -- needs AppSec verification |
| 4 | Updated velocity story (17 roles, Explorer/Villager) | P3 | **Carries forward** |
| 5 | "Big File Sweet Spot" messaging draft | P3 | **Carries forward** -- now connected to the upload/download resilience research in the v0.3.10 brief |

## 3. Story Angles

### 3.1 "Privacy by Design, Not by Policy"

**The story:** The DPO role caught IP address capture before it happened -- not in a review, not in an audit, but during the configuration process. The brief says it plainly: "the DPO's presence in the team ensured privacy was built in from the start, not bolted on after."

**Why it works:** This is a concrete, specific example of a principle that most organisations claim but few deliver. "Privacy by design" is a phrase in every GDPR compliance brochure. Showing what it looks like in practice -- a logging configuration that never captures IP addresses because the DPO was consulted during design -- is more compelling than any policy statement.

**Audience:** Security-conscious engineering teams, GDPR/privacy professionals, CISOs evaluating tools, AI practitioners interested in how role-based agentic teams can enforce non-functional requirements.

**Format:** Blog post (1,000-1,500 words). Can be adapted into a shorter LinkedIn post when LinkedIn is re-prioritised.

**Timing:** Can be written now. The facts are established. The logging configuration is deployed. Decision D042 confirms the validation.

**Connection to existing content:** This extends the "Three Zeros" message (zero cookies, zero tracking, zero frameworks) into operational territory. The three zeros describe the user-facing privacy posture. The DPO story describes the operational-data privacy posture. Together they say: "We do not just protect your files. We protect our own logs too."

### 3.2 "What If Sharing a File Was as Easy as Saying Three Words?"

**The story:** The three-word key concept turns encrypted file sharing into a conversational act. Instead of copying a URL, you say three words over the phone, in a meeting, or in a voice message. The recipient types them in. The file downloads and decrypts.

**Why it works:** Every encryption product struggles with the same problem: the mechanism that makes it secure also makes it inconvenient. Long URLs, hash fragments, key files, password managers -- these are all friction. Three words is frictionless. It is the kind of simplification that makes people say "why did nobody do this before?"

**Audience:** General audience, non-technical users, product designers, UX practitioners. This is the broadest-appeal story in the current pipeline.

**Format:** Concept piece / blog post (800-1,200 words). Could also become landing page copy if the feature ships.

**Timing:** Do NOT publish until the security review is complete (AppSec, Decision D040). The concept is appealing but the security trade-offs are real. Publishing before the review risks one of two outcomes: (1) promising a feature we cannot deliver if AppSec says no, or (2) being publicly criticised for weakening encryption without having done the analysis. Draft the content now; hold publication.

**Risk note:** The trademark/patent question around "What Three Words" must be resolved before any public-facing content uses the three-word framing. The Journalist should use the neutral term "Word Keys" or "Passphrase Keys" in any draft until legal/trademark guidance is available.

### 3.3 "Own Your Analytics" (Server Analytics Narrative)

**The story:** SGraph Send builds its own analytics instead of using Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or Datadog. The LETS pipeline collects data from AWS, transforms it, and stores it in the project's own cache service. No third party sees the traffic patterns, user behaviour, or infrastructure state.

**Why it works:** Data sovereignty is a growing concern for organisations. Most tools require you to send your operational data to a third party to understand your own systems. SGraph Send refuses this trade-off, building a self-contained analytics pipeline that treats operational data with the same care as user data.

**Audience:** Engineering leaders evaluating observability tools, privacy-conscious operators, DevOps/SRE teams frustrated with vendor lock-in. Narrower than the three-word story but deeper resonance with the target audience.

**Format:** Technical blog post (1,500-2,000 words) with architecture diagrams. Could become a standalone landing page section for the SA product when it matures into the reserved `server-analytics` PyPI package.

**Timing:** Wait until the SA dashboard has at least the cache service browser and one additional view (Lambda functions or CloudFront logs) working. The story needs screenshots or a demo. Writing about an analytics pipeline without showing the dashboard is a "trust us" claim. Showing the dashboard is a "see for yourself" proof.

## 6. Coordination Requests

| To | Request | Context |
|----|---------|---------|
| **Designer** | Confirm that the three landing page copy options (v0.3.2 action plan, Section 1.3) are included in the design agency brief package. | The agency brief exists (`v0.3.3__brief__cruz-and-cruz-design-agency.md`). The Journalist needs to verify the copy reached the agency materials. |
| **AppSec** | When the three-word key security review (D040, task #20) is complete, notify the Journalist. Publication of the concept piece is gated on the outcome. | The Journalist has a draft hook and narrative ready but will not publish until the security analysis is confirmed. |
| **DPO** | Provide any additional detail on the logging configuration privacy decisions for the "Privacy by Design" blog post. Specifically: which data fields were excluded and why, and was the decision documented in the AWS configuration itself? | The draft narrative is written but would benefit from specifics that make the claims more concrete and auditable. |
| **Architect** | Confirm the "no size limits" claim for the landing page copy (carried from v0.3.2 request). Also: when the upload/download resilience research document is ready, notify the Journalist for the "Big File Sweet Spot" messaging. | Two separate content items depend on Architect outputs. |
| **Librarian** | Index this action plan. Note: (1) three new story angles added to the pipeline, (2) privacy-by-design blog post is ready to draft, (3) three-word key content is gated on AppSec review, (4) landing page copy awaiting feedback. | -- |
