# v0.4.12 -- Addendum: The Incident Report That Leaked the Token

**Role:** Journalist
**Date:** 19 February 2026
**Version:** v0.4.12
**Type:** Addendum to "The 100-Minute Security Hotfix"
**Related:** [Original article](v0.4.12__article__100-minute-security-hotfix.md), [Historian INC-004 record](../../historian/reviews/26-02-19/v0.4.12__incident-record__INC-004__documentation-token-leak.md)

## What Happened

Thirty minutes after deploying the fix for the access token leak (INC-003), the documentation of that fix created a second leak.

The Journalist's article "The 100-Minute Security Hotfix" included the actual live token value in its example URLs. So did the Historian's incident record and the Librarian's master index. Three pre-existing files from the 17 February security review also contained the same value.

The human spotted it during review. Four minutes later, all six files were redacted and pushed.

## The Irony

An article about leaking credentials in URLs... leaked a credential in its example URLs.

This isn't a new class of problem. Security teams have been accidentally including real credentials in incident reports since incident reports were invented. But there's something about experiencing it in real time -- within the same hour as fixing the original leak -- that makes the lesson stick.

The instinct when writing an incident report is to be thorough: show the real URL, show the real token, show exactly what went wrong. Thoroughness is usually a virtue. In this case, thoroughness reproduced the vulnerability.

## The Numbers

| Metric | INC-003 (code leak) | INC-004 (documentation leak) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Time to fix | ~100 minutes | ~4 minutes |
| Files affected | 8 | 6 |
| Root cause | Token treated as URL parameter | Token treated as illustrative example |
| Shared root cause | **Credential treated as non-sensitive in context** | |

---

## The Lesson

A credential is a credential is a credential. Not "a credential in code but an example in docs." Not "sensitive in URLs but harmless in markdown." The value is the secret, regardless of the file format it appears in.

The fix is simple: use `[REDACTED]` from the start. Don't write the real value and plan to redact later. Treat every documentation pipeline as a publication pipeline.

---

## What's Still Exposed

The token value remains in git history on multiple branches. Redacting the current files removes it from HEAD but not from the commit log. The options are:

1. **Rotate the token** (recommended) -- simple, effective, doesn't require destructive git operations
2. **Rewrite git history** -- thorough but destructive, affects all collaborators
3. **Both** -- belt and suspenders

This is a human decision (Q017 in the Historian's record).

---

## The Second Story

If INC-003 teaches "authentication credentials must never be forwarded," INC-004 teaches "credentials must never be documented verbatim." The first is a code pattern. The second is a workflow pattern. Together they define a principle:

**A secret's sensitivity is intrinsic to its value, not to its context.**

*Journalist addendum complete. The original article has been updated (token redacted). This addendum records what happened, why, and what it teaches. Before any future incident report is written: establish the `[REDACTED]` convention as the default, not the exception.*
