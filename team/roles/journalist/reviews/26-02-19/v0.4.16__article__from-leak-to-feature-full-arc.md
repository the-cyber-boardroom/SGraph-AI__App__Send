## The Short Version

At 13:50, a human spotted a live access token in a URL. By 15:30, the fix was in production. By 15:50, the agents documenting that fix had accidentally created a data breach. By 16:28, the breach was contained. By 16:36, the human decided to leave the token active — on purpose — as a controlled experiment. By 17:00, the human was answering the regulatory questionnaire by voice, talking to ChatGPT. By 17:15, the answer was in: no ICO notification required.

Three hours. One token. Four incidents' worth of lessons. Zero user data compromised.

## Act 1: The Leak (INC-003)

The story starts simply enough. A sender access token — the credential that lets you upload files to SGraph Send — was being embedded in shareable download URLs. Every link shared with a recipient also shared the sender's identity. A code pattern treated an authentication credential as a URL parameter.

The human spotted it at 13:50. By 15:30, the fix was deployed to production. Eight files changed, four frontend versions patched, 153 tests passing. The zero-knowledge encryption meant no file content was ever at risk — but the token itself granted platform access (uploads, transfer metadata) that recipients were never meant to have.

**Lesson 1:** Zero-knowledge architecture limits blast radius. The worst-case scenario for a leaked token is quota abuse, not data exposure.

---

## Act 2: The Documentation Breach (INC-004)

Then things got interesting.

The agents assigned to document INC-003 — Historian, Journalist, Librarian — wrote their reports using the real token values as examples. The actual live token. The actual transfer ID. The actual decryption key. Committed and pushed to GitHub.

The human spotted it again, fifteen minutes after the documentation was pushed. The Journalist's article about leaking credentials in URLs had leaked the same credential in its example URLs.

But INC-004 was worse than INC-003. The documentation included not just the access token, but the transfer ID and decryption key for a real file — an "Enterprise AI Time-to-Value Survey" that the human had uploaded earlier that afternoon. Transfer ID plus decryption key is the full data access path. Anyone with access to the git branch could download and decrypt the file.

This was a data breach. Not theoretical — actual.

**Lesson 2:** A secret's sensitivity is intrinsic to its value, not to its context. A token in code and a token in documentation are the same token.

## Act 3: Containment (~12 minutes)

The response was fast:
- 16:04 — Tokens redacted from 6 files
- 16:12 — Transfer IDs and decryption keys redacted from 3 files
- 16:20 — S3 object deletion initiated
- 16:28 — S3 deletion confirmed (2 objects, 9.0 KB, permanently deleted)
- 16:28 — New SG/Send link created and sent to original recipient

The encrypted file no longer exists. The decryption key in git history is now useless — it decrypts nothing. The download URL returns "Transfer not found."

**Lesson 3:** S3 deletion is a retroactive remedy for zero-knowledge systems. If the ciphertext is gone, the key is worthless.

---

## Act 4: The Deliberate Exposure

Here's where the story takes an unexpected turn.

The human decided *not* to rotate the access token. Instead, he decided to push the article — with the token still live in git history — to the `dev` branch. On purpose.

Why? Two reasons.

First, as a **honeypot experiment.** The token has 20 uses remaining out of 50. If anyone finds it in git history and uses it, the usage count will change. It's a canary — a way to measure whether credentials in git history actually get discovered and exploited.

Second, as a **preview of a future product feature.** The human is thinking about a gamification/advocacy model where access tokens are deliberately shared publicly — on LinkedIn, in WhatsApp groups — to drive user adoption. Share a token, let someone try the product, track the referral. The token IS the distribution mechanism.

Three roles assessed the risk:
- **GRC** identified 5 risks, all rated acceptable. The 20-use hard limit is a natural safety boundary.
- **Sherpa** rated the trail as PASSABLE for the current action, NOT PASSABLE for future public sharing (3 P1 infrastructure blockers).
- **DPO** cleared the immediate action but declared a DPIA mandatory before any public token sharing programme.

**Lesson 4:** An accidental leak can reveal a product capability. What was a bug (token in URL) becomes a feature (token as distribution mechanism) once the proper safeguards exist.

## Act 5: The Voice Interview

The data breach required a regulatory assessment. Under UK GDPR, the affected user needs to describe the exposed data's sensitivity so the team can determine whether to notify the ICO.

Rather than typing out the answers, the team created a ChatGPT voice mode prompt — a structured interview script that guides the conversation through 7 questions, asks follow-ups, and produces formatted markdown output.

The human pasted the prompt into ChatGPT, switched to voice mode, and had a conversational interview about the breach. Five minutes later, the structured output was ready.

The answer: **Level 1 — Public.** The survey contained the human's name and email (personal data) but nothing sensitive. No ICO notification required.

Three friction points were noted along the way:
1. ChatGPT voice mode requires login (no anonymous access)
2. Anonymous/temporary chat mode errored at the time of use
3. The "paste first, then switch to voice" workflow wasn't obvious

**Lesson 5:** Voice mode turns a tedious questionnaire into a 5-minute conversation. The friction is in the setup, not the interview.

## The Arc

```
Accidental leak → Fix → Documentation of fix creates breach →
Breach contained → Deliberate exposure as experiment →
Risk formally accepted → Voice interview closes regulatory question →
Incident closed. No user data compromised. Feature idea discovered.
```

What started as a security bug ended as a product insight. The token sharing model — discovered accidentally — may become a deliberate growth mechanism. But only once the infrastructure exists to make it safe: threat detection, deployment isolation, automated response.

Until then, there's a token with 20 uses sitting in git history. A canary in the codebase. We're watching.
