## Context Since Last Activity

### What Happened (16 Feb)

The Journalist's last output was the co-authored article with the Historian: "What Happens When You Embed a DPO From Day One" — a 27KB evidence-based case study of 10 DPO interventions over 9 days. This was produced in response to the v0.4.4 Explorer daily brief's DPO/AppSec/GRC evidence pack task.

### Key Project Changes (v0.3.2 -> v0.4.8)

1. **Strategic pivot (D038):** SG/Send is now an "encrypted workflow platform", not just file transfer. JSON in / JSON out with dynamic UIs, all client-side encrypted.

2. **New concepts introduced:**
   - Interactive encrypted data workflows (translation review, client-side translation as product, general-purpose encrypted workflows)
   - Briefing packs for parallel agent execution
   - Daily memo workflow (Architect + Librarian always process first)

3. **New role:** Translator (Villager-exclusive) — handles language + audience translation. Human reviewer step is non-negotiable (D043).

4. **Brand identity:** "SG/Send" adopted as brand shorthand (D045). Design guidelines and logo briefs produced.

5. **Two-team operation:** Explorer and Villager briefs are now separate. Explorer builds new features; Villager deploys to production.

### Journalist-Specific Context

- The DPO/AppSec/GRC evidence pack article (Article 2 — narrative) may need follow-up or revision
- The "Why not WeTransfer?" differentiation content (from v0.3.2 action plan) is still relevant but now has a stronger answer: SG/Send is not a WeTransfer competitor — it's an encrypted workflow platform
- The interactive encrypted workflows pivot is a major new story to tell
- The non-English market hypothesis (from Translator brief) is new messaging territory

### Pending Tasks from v0.4.4 Debrief
