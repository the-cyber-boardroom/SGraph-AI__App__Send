# What Happens When You Embed a DPO From Day One

**An evidence-based case study from SGraph Send**

**Version:** v0.4.4
**Date:** 16 February 2026
**Roles:** Journalist and Historian (co-authored)
**Type:** Feature article -- external audience (DPOs, privacy professionals, engineering leaders)

## The short version

SGraph Send is a zero-knowledge encrypted file-sharing service. The server cannot read your files. The decryption key never leaves the sender's device. All backend data is, by design, non-sensitive.

None of this is remarkable. What is remarkable is what happened when we embedded a Data Protection Officer into the development team from the first week of the project -- not as a reviewer at the end, but as a team member from the start.

Over 9 days (8--16 February 2026), the DPO made 10 documented interventions that changed the project's trajectory. This article presents the evidence: what the DPO caught, when they caught it, what would have happened without them, and why the timing matters more than anything else.

If you are a DPO, a privacy professional, or an engineering leader deciding when to involve data protection in your development process, this case study is for you.

## 1. The setup: an AI team with 17 roles

SGraph Send is built by a coordinated team of AI agents, each operating as a named role -- Architect, Developer, QA, DevOps, AppSec, and so on. There are 17 roles in total, organised into two teams (Explorer and Villager) based on Wardley Maps methodology. A human stakeholder (Dinis Cruz) provides daily briefs, makes architectural decisions, and reviews output.

The DPO is one of these 17 roles. It has a review folder, an action tracker, and a seat at the table. When the DevOps role configures AWS logging, the DPO reviews the configuration. When the Architect proposes a new data model, the DPO assesses the personal data implications. When a daily brief proposes a new feature, the DPO asks: what data does this touch, and what is the lawful basis?

This is the model we are testing: **the DPO as a development team member, not an external reviewer.**

What follows is the evidence of what this model produces.

## 2. The evidence: 10 interventions in 9 days

Between 8 and 16 February 2026, the DPO made 10 documented interventions that changed outcomes. We have categorised them by confidence level -- how clearly the DPO's presence changed what would have happened without them.

### HIGH confidence (5 interventions)

These are cases where the evidence is explicit, the counterfactual is clear, and the DPO's intervention directly changed an outcome.

---

### Intervention 1: IP addresses excluded from CloudFront logs

**Date:** 15 February 2026
**What happened:** The DevOps role configured AWS observability across 15 data sources. For CloudFront Real-Time Logs, the configuration explicitly excluded five IP-related fields: `c-ip`, `c-port`, `x-forwarded-for`, `c-ip-version`, and `c-country`.

**The DPO's role:** The DPO reviewed the DevOps configuration *before* deployment and confirmed the field selection was adequate. The 15 Feb daily brief states: "When configuring the AWS logging, the DPO role was keeping an eye on the brief, and the DevOps configuration that went into AWS made sure we don't capture IP addresses or other sensitive data in the logs."

**What would have happened without the DPO:** The default CloudFront log configuration includes the client IP address. DevOps teams typically select all available fields for maximum observability -- collect everything, filter later. Without the DPO:

1. IP addresses would have been stored in S3 as part of raw log files.
2. The analytics pipeline would have processed IP addresses through multiple transformation stages, multiplying the locations where personal data exists.
3. The project would have been non-compliant with UK GDPR from the moment logging was enabled, without anyone realising it.
4. Retrofitting would have required: reconfiguring CloudFront, deleting historical logs containing IPs, updating pipeline parsers, and producing a breach assessment for the gap period.

**Estimated retrofit cost:** 2--4 engineering sessions, plus the compliance risk of having processed personal data without documented lawful basis.

**Why this matters for other DPOs:** This is the single strongest piece of evidence in this case study. The field-level exclusion is documented in the DevOps setup guide. The daily brief explicitly credits the DPO's involvement. And the counterfactual is concrete: the default includes IPs; the DPO's presence changed the default.

---

### Intervention 2: Demanding empirical verification, not just configuration

**Date:** 16 February 2026
**What happened:** After the IP exclusion was configured, the DPO escalated the assurance requirement. Configuration alone was deemed insufficient. The DPO required empirical evidence -- examination of actual log data -- to confirm that IP addresses are genuinely absent.

**The DPO's words:** "The DPO requires evidence." And: "Are IP addresses actually not being stored in the CloudFront logs? This needs to be confirmed empirically, not assumed."

**What the DPO specified:** A three-stage verification procedure:

- **Stage A:** Verify the Firehose delivery stream configuration matches the approved field list.
- **Stage B:** Download and examine actual log files. Apply regex pattern matching for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses across *all* field values, not just expected IP fields.
- **Stage C:** Establish ongoing weekly automated monitoring to detect configuration drift.

**What does NOT count as evidence:** The DPO explicitly listed what is insufficient:
- "We configured Firehose to exclude IP fields" -- configuration, not evidence.
- "The DevOps setup guide says IPs are excluded" -- documentation, not evidence.
- "AWS says Real-Time Logs respect field selection" -- vendor assurance, not our evidence.
- "We tested once and it was fine" -- single-point verification does not address drift.

**Why this matters:** An ICO auditor asking "how do you know IP addresses are not in your logs?" receives two very different answers:

- Without the DPO: "Because we configured it that way."
- With the DPO: "Because we verified by examining actual log samples, and here is the timestamped evidence report."

The second answer is GDPR Article 5(2) accountability. The first is a statement of intent.

### Intervention 3: Google Analytics removed entirely, not mitigated

**Date:** 13 February 2026
**What happened:** The DPO identified Google Analytics as a PECR violation (third-party cookies without consent) and flagged it as P0 -- the highest priority. The DPO's assessment drove the decision to remove GA entirely rather than adding a cookie consent banner.

**The DPO's reasoning:** GA fundamentally contradicts the zero-knowledge promise. A service that tells users "we cannot read your files" while simultaneously running a Google tracking script is making incompatible claims. The DPO framed this not as a technical issue but as a trust issue: the presence of GA undermines the core product proposition.

**What would have happened without the DPO:** GA would likely have remained with a cookie consent banner added -- the standard industry response. The AppSec role independently flagged GA as a supply chain risk (the script could be modified at source), but it was the DPO's privacy framing that drove *complete removal* rather than *mitigation*.

**The outcome:** Zero third-party scripts. Zero cookies. The project's server-side analytics pipeline was designed from scratch to process only operational metadata with no personal data.

**Why this matters:** Consent banners are a patch. Removing the tracking entirely is architecture. The DPO's intervention moved the team from "how do we make this compliant?" to "why do we have this at all?"

---

### Intervention 4: File name regression caught before it shipped

**Date:** 15 February 2026
**What happened:** A new file transfer engine was being designed, with a transfer manifest that included a `"name": "quarterly-report.pdf"` field. The DPO flagged this as a regression.

**The existing architecture:** SGraph Send deliberately does not send original file names to the server. This is a data minimisation measure -- file names can reveal personal data about the sender, recipient, or file subject ("John-Smith-CV.pdf", "medical-records-2026.xlsx").

**What the DPO caught:** The new transfer engine's manifest example included the file name in plaintext. If implemented as designed, this would have silently reintroduced personal data to the server, undoing a deliberate privacy decision.

**The DPO's requirement:** "The transfer manifest MUST NOT include the original file name unless it is encrypted. File names can reveal personal data about the sender, recipient, or file subject. The file name should either be excluded from the manifest or encrypted along with the file content."

**Why this matters:** Regressions are the quiet enemy of privacy by design. A feature that was correctly implemented can be silently undone by a new component that does not know about the original design constraint. The DPO's embedded presence means someone is watching for exactly this kind of drift.

---

### Intervention 5: Unencrypted mode flagged as a fundamental change

**Date:** 14 February 2026
**What happened:** A daily brief proposed an optional unencrypted file transfer mode for convenience. The DPO immediately identified this as a fundamental change to SGraph's data processing role.

**The DPO's analysis:**

- **Currently:** SGraph stores ciphertext it cannot decrypt. It is not a data processor for file contents. A server breach exposes encrypted blobs that are computationally useless without the key. No ICO notification is required.
- **With unencrypted mode:** SGraph stores plaintext files. It becomes a data processor for file contents. A server breach exposes readable files. ICO notification is required if personal data is involved. Data subject rights (access, erasure, portability) apply to stored files.

**The DPO's requirements:**

1. A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) must be completed before the feature launches.
2. The privacy notice must differentiate between encrypted and unencrypted modes.
3. The uploader must accept explicit data processing terms when choosing unencrypted mode.
4. Separate retention and deletion procedures must be defined for plaintext files.
5. Server-side access controls must be tighter for unencrypted files.

**What would have happened without the DPO:** Unencrypted mode would have been treated as a UX toggle. The legal implications -- SGraph becoming a data processor, changed breach notification obligations, new data subject rights -- would not have been identified until a data incident or regulatory inquiry.

### MEDIUM-HIGH confidence (1 intervention)

### Intervention 6: Log retention designed into the architecture from the start

**Date:** 16 February 2026
**What happened:** The log archival pipeline was being designed to move old logs from S3 to Glacier for cost optimisation. The DPO ensured that this was also a data governance decision, not just a cost decision.

**What the DPO produced:** A comprehensive retention framework with five tiers:

| Data Stage | Retention | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Raw logs (S3) | 7 days | Input to the pipeline. Once processed, no further purpose. |
| Parsed JSON | 30 days | Debugging and verification. Per-record data enables individual request identification. |
| Consolidated summaries | 90 days | Operational analytics. Individual requests grouped. |
| Daily aggregations | 1 year | Trend analysis. Low personal data risk. |
| Monthly aggregations | Indefinite | Purely statistical. No individual is distinguishable. |

The DPO also specified: **automated deletion is mandatory.** S3 lifecycle policies and cache service TTLs must implement the retention periods. Manual deletion is unreliable and creates compliance risk.

And critically: **"It is cheap to store" is not a lawful basis.** The DPO explicitly called out the common engineering pattern of retaining data indefinitely because Glacier storage is inexpensive. Cost is not a legal basis for retention under GDPR Article 5(1)(e).

**What would have happened without the DPO:** Logs would have been archived to Glacier as a cost optimisation measure, with no retention period, no deletion schedule, and no lawful basis consideration. The data would have accumulated indefinitely -- the default pattern in most engineering teams.

---

### MEDIUM confidence (4 interventions)

---

### Intervention 7: Privacy policies treated as legal documents in the translation pipeline

**Date:** 14 February 2026
**What happened:** When the Translator role was defined, the DPO ensured that privacy policies were identified as legal documents requiring legally appropriate localisation per market -- not generic text for literal translation.

**Why this matters:** "Data controller" has a precise legal definition in UK GDPR, Brazilian LGPD, and Portuguese GDPR implementation -- and the terminology differs in each. A generic translation could produce legally inaccurate text. The DPO's involvement structured the pipeline correctly from the start: DPO produces the legally appropriate content, Translator produces the linguistically appropriate version.

---

### Intervention 8: Zero-knowledge reframed as a data protection architecture

**Date:** Ongoing, 8--16 February 2026
**What happened:** The DPO reframed the zero-knowledge architecture from a security feature to a data protection architecture. This distinction matters because:

- A **security feature** can be traded off against usability ("we could add an unencrypted mode for convenience").
- A **data protection architecture** creates legal constraints -- introducing plaintext processing requires a DPIA, documented lawful basis, and updated privacy notices.

The DPO's specific contributions include: the requirement that file names never be sent to the server (data minimisation beyond what security alone requires), the IP hashing approach with daily salt (pseudonymisation), and the ongoing enforcement of zero-knowledge as a non-negotiable constraint.

---

### Intervention 9: LaunchList identified as requiring a Data Processing Agreement

**Date:** 13 February 2026
**What happened:** The DPO identified that the LaunchList signup form (collecting name and email) makes LaunchList a data processor under GDPR Article 28, requiring a Data Processing Agreement.

**What would have happened without the DPO:** The LaunchList integration would have been treated as a simple form submission. The DPA obligation would not have been identified.

---

### Intervention 10: Referrer-Policy given a dual privacy and security justification

**Date:** 15 February 2026
**What happened:** CloudFront was configured with `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` as a response header. AppSec originally flagged this as a security measure (preventing hash-fragment key leakage). The DPO added a second justification: it also prevents URL-based personal data from leaking to third parties via the Referrer header.

**Why this matters:** The dual justification means that even if the security rationale were removed (e.g., keys moved out of URL fragments), the data protection rationale would keep the header in place. Defence in depth, applied to policy as well as code.

---

## 3. The counterfactual question

Every DPO will recognise the challenge of demonstrating value. Data protection work is, by nature, preventive. When it works, nothing happens. The absence of a breach is not a compelling board presentation.

This case study attempts to answer the counterfactual directly: **what would the project look like if the DPO were not present?**

Based on the 10 interventions above:

**IP addresses in production logs.** The default CloudFront configuration includes client IPs. Without the DPO, the project would have been processing personal data in its log pipeline from day one, without documented lawful basis, without retention limits, and without anyone recognising it as a data protection issue. This would have surfaced, eventually, either during a regulatory inquiry or when someone noticed IP addresses in the analytics pipeline and asked "should we be storing these?" -- potentially months after go-live.

**Google Analytics still running.** The standard mitigation for GA is a consent banner. Without the DPO's framing of GA as a trust contradiction (not just a compliance issue), the project would have the same cookie consent banner as every other website. The zero-knowledge value proposition would be undermined by a Google tracking script loading on every page.

**File names on the server.** The transfer engine redesign included file names in the manifest. Without the DPO watching for regressions, this data minimisation property would have been silently lost. File names are not typically classified as personal data by engineers -- but "John-Smith-CV.pdf" is personal data, and "medical-records-2026.xlsx" might be special category data.

**No retention policy on logs.** Glacier is cheap. Without someone explicitly challenging indefinite retention, logs would accumulate forever. This is UK GDPR Article 5(1)(e) non-compliance, and it is the default state of most engineering teams.

**Unencrypted mode as a simple feature toggle.** Without the DPO, the proposal to add unencrypted transfers would have been treated as a product decision, not a legal one. The moment a user uploads an unencrypted file containing personal data, SGraph's legal obligations change fundamentally -- and this would not have been identified until it was too late to design for it.

---

## 4. Architecture vs. audit: why timing is everything

The DPO's self-assessment captures this precisely:

> "When the DPO reviews at the end, the output is a list of problems to fix. When the DPO is embedded from the start, the output is an architecture that does not have those problems."

> "The cost difference is not just engineering effort. Retrofitting privacy means admitting the system was non-compliant for a period. Designing privacy in means the system was never non-compliant. The second is not just cheaper -- it is legally different."

This is the core finding of this case study. **The value of the DPO is not in what they find. It is in when they find it.**

Consider the CloudFront IP exclusion. If the DPO had reviewed the logging configuration after production deployment:

1. IP addresses would already be stored in S3.
2. The analytics pipeline would already be processing them.
3. The parsers would expect IP fields.
4. The fix would require: reconfiguring CloudFront, deleting or reprocessing historical logs, updating pipeline code, and producing a breach assessment for the non-compliant period.

Instead, the DPO reviewed the configuration before deployment. The fix was: exclude the fields. Time cost: minutes. Legal cost: zero. Compliance gap: zero.

The same pattern applies to every intervention in this case study. The DPO's presence at design time converts retroactive compliance findings into proactive architectural decisions.

---

## 5. The DSAR position: data minimisation as a defence

One of the most instructive outcomes of this approach is how it affects Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs).

A data subject who requests access to their personal data under Article 15 presents a practical challenge: how do you identify their data in your logs when you do not have their IP address?

The DPO's answer: **you cannot. And this is by design.**

The IP exclusion from CloudFront logs means the service cannot link a specific request to a specific data subject. The IP hashing in application logs means the service can confirm that a hash exists but cannot reverse it to identify the original IP without the daily salt.

The procedure for DSARs becomes:

1. If the data subject provides their IP address, hash it with the relevant daily salt and search for matching entries within the 30-day CloudWatch retention window.
2. For CloudFront logs, there is no IP address at all. Individual requests cannot be identified.
3. The response: "We have designed our logging to minimise personal data collection. We do not retain IP addresses in our CloudFront logs."

The ICO would view the inability to identify a data subject's log entries as evidence of effective data minimisation, not as a failure to comply with the access right. This is a strong data protection position -- and it exists only because the DPO influenced the logging configuration before any data was collected.

---

## 6. What the DPO still worries about

Honest reporting requires acknowledging what has not been addressed. The DPO's open concerns, in priority order:

1. **No privacy policy exists.** The project is live. Users are accessing it. There is no published privacy notice. This is a UK GDPR Article 13 requirement. It has been an open P1 action since 13 February and remains unaddressed.

2. **No documented lawful basis for IP hash storage.** The application hashes IP addresses with a daily salt. Hashed IPs are pseudonymised personal data under GDPR. The lawful basis (likely legitimate interests) has not been documented via a formal Legitimate Interests Assessment.

3. **No LaunchList DPA.** LaunchList processes name and email addresses on the project's behalf. A Data Processing Agreement is required under Article 28.

4. **The data map is growing faster than the documentation.** New data flows are being added (CloudFront logs, CloudWatch logs, CloudTrail, S3 access logs, temporal aggregations, Glacier archives) without a comprehensive data map that tracks what personal data flows through each stage.

These are not theoretical risks. They are current gaps. The DPO has escalated them, tracked them, and assigned priorities. They remain open.

This is also part of the evidence. An embedded DPO does not make every problem disappear. It makes every problem visible.

## 8. What this means for other DPOs

### The model

Embed the DPO in the development team. Not as an external reviewer. Not as a compliance checkpoint before release. As a team member who reads the daily briefs, reviews the infrastructure configurations, assesses new feature proposals, and catches regressions before they ship.

### The investment

The DPO's involvement in this project consisted of reviewing daily briefs and producing written assessments -- roughly equivalent to what a DPO might spend on a monthly compliance review, but distributed across daily touchpoints. The difference is not the total time invested. The difference is *when* the time is invested.

### The returns

In 9 days, the DPO:

- Prevented IP addresses from entering the production log pipeline (Intervention 1)
- Established a verification procedure that produces audit-ready evidence (Intervention 2)
- Drove the removal of third-party tracking rather than just mitigating it (Intervention 3)
- Caught a data minimisation regression before it was implemented (Intervention 4)
- Identified a feature proposal as a fundamental change in data processing role (Intervention 5)
- Designed retention periods into the log architecture from the start (Intervention 6)

Each of these, discovered after the fact, would have cost significantly more to fix -- in engineering time, in compliance risk, and in the legal cost of having been non-compliant during the gap period.

### The principle

**The cheapest privacy fix is the one that never needs to be made.**

When the DPO is present at design time, the architecture does not contain the problems. When the DPO reviews after deployment, the architecture must be changed to remove the problems. The difference is not marginal. It is categorical.

## 9. A note on methodology

This case study was produced by two roles -- the Journalist (narrative structure, external audience framing) and the Historian (factual verification, evidence trail, counterfactual assessment). Every intervention cited in this article is documented in the DPO's review files with source references, quotes, and timestamps.

The confidence levels (HIGH, MEDIUM-HIGH, MEDIUM) reflect an honest assessment of how clearly the DPO's presence changed the outcome. HIGH-confidence interventions have explicit documentation and clear counterfactuals. MEDIUM-confidence interventions reflect cases where the DPO's influence is real but either shared with other roles or at the planning stage rather than producing a completed outcome.

We have not inflated the evidence. We have not claimed credit for decisions that would have been made anyway. The zero-knowledge architecture, for example, was the human stakeholder's vision -- the DPO's contribution was the data protection framing and the ongoing enforcement, not the original design.
