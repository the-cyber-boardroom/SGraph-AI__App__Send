## The Short Version

Two browser windows. Two different networks. One encrypted message flying between them — and the server never saw a single plaintext character. On 20 February 2026, SG/Send achieved its first browser-to-browser PKI encrypted message exchange, and the project owner announced it to the world on LinkedIn.

## What Happened

The PKI Manager page — a single Web Component running in the admin console — went from "secure context error" to "Hello from prod!!!!!!" in a single session.

**The setup:** One browser on localhost (the developer's laptop). One browser on the production admin server (send.sgraph.ai). Each generated its own RSA-OAEP 4096-bit key pair. Each copied its public key and imported the other's.

**The exchange:** On prod, Dinis typed "Hello from prod!!!!!!" and hit Encrypt & Copy. A base64 blob appeared — a self-contained payload wrapping an AES-256-GCM session key inside RSA-OAEP armour. He pasted it into the localhost session. Hit Decrypt. The message appeared in green.

Then the reverse: "Hello from the laptop" went from localhost to prod. Same mechanism, same zero-knowledge guarantee, opposite direction.

**The server's role:** None. The server served the HTML and JavaScript. After that, it was a bystander. Every cryptographic operation — key generation, encryption, decryption — happened inside the browser's Web Crypto API. The private keys are marked `non-extractable` at generation time: not even the JavaScript that created them can read them back.

## Why This Matters

SG/Send started as a zero-knowledge file sharing tool. Files get encrypted in the browser before upload. The server stores ciphertext. This has been working since the early MVPs.

But files are one-way. You upload, someone downloads. There's no conversation.

PKI messaging changes the model. Now two parties can exchange information — text today, arbitrary data tomorrow — with mathematical guarantees about who can read it. The server remains a courier that never opens the envelope.

This is the foundation for:
- **Signed file transfers** — proving who uploaded a file
- **Multi-party workflows** — encrypted messages between participants in a transfer
- **Key-based identity** — moving beyond tokens toward cryptographic identity

## The LinkedIn Moment

Dinis published the milestone to his professional network, complete with side-by-side screenshots of both browser sessions. The post was technically precise — listing the exact algorithms (RSA-OAEP 4096, AES-256-GCM), the security properties (non-extractable keys, zero server plaintext), and crucially, what's **not** yet done: no sender authentication, no fingerprint verification.

That honesty matters. Calling out the gap between "confidentiality" and "authentication" in a public post sets the right expectations and shows the team knows where the boundaries are.

## What Came Next (Same Session)

Within the same session, digital signatures were added. New keys now generate an ECDSA P-256 signing key pair alongside the RSA-OAEP encryption pair. Messages are signed on encrypt and verified on decrypt. The "Encrypt & Sign" / "Decrypt & Verify" workflow addresses the authentication gap called out in the LinkedIn post — though this was implemented after the post was published.

## The Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Key generation time (RSA-OAEP 4096) | ~2-5 seconds |
| Key generation time (ECDSA P-256 signing) | Instant |
| Encryption | RSA-OAEP + AES-256-GCM hybrid |
| Signature | ECDSA P-256 with SHA-256 |
| Private key extractability | Non-extractable (browser-enforced) |
| Server plaintext exposure | Zero |
| External dependencies | Zero (Web Crypto API native) |
| Payload versions | v1 (unsigned), v2 (signed) |
