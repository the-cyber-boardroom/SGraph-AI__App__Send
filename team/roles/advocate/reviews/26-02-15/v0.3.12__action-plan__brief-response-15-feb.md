## 1. Acknowledged Tasks

The v0.3.10 brief assigns the Advocate one explicit task:

| Task | Priority | Co-owners | Status |
|------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Three-word key UX evaluation (#20) | **P3** | Architect, AppSec | Addressed in this document (Sections 2 and 3) |

The brief asks: "From a UX perspective, how much easier does this make the sharing experience?"

This document provides the full evaluation. The Advocate's answer is: **significantly easier for specific user segments, and potentially transformative for the product's viral loop -- but only if the security trade-offs are acceptable (AppSec's call) and the implementation preserves the simplicity of the concept.**

---

## 2. Three-Word Key UX Evaluation

### 2.1 The Current Sharing Flow

To evaluate the three-word key concept, we must first be precise about what it replaces. The current flow for sharing a file via SGraph Send:

**Sender:**
1. Upload file
2. File is encrypted in browser
3. Receive a URL containing a hash fragment with the decryption key (e.g., `https://send.sgraph.ai/download/abc123def456#K7xPm9...long-base64-key...`)
4. Copy the URL
5. Share the URL with the recipient via some channel (email, message, chat)

**Recipient:**
1. Receive the URL
2. Click the URL
3. Browser opens the download page
4. Decryption key is extracted from the hash fragment (never sent to server)
5. File is decrypted in browser
6. Download completes

**What works well:** The URL is self-contained. A single click gets the recipient from "I received a link" to "I have the file." No separate key to manage. No instructions to follow. The hash-fragment approach is elegant -- the key travels with the URL but the server never sees it.

**What does not work well:** The URL is long, opaque, and impossible to communicate verbally. If the sender needs to share the link over the phone, they cannot. If the sender needs to dictate the link in a meeting, they cannot. If the sender needs to write it on a sticky note, they cannot. The URL is a machine-to-machine artefact dressed up as a human-to-human communication.

### 2.2 The Three-Word Key Flow

The proposed flow:

**Sender:**
1. Upload file
2. File is encrypted in browser using a key derived from three words
3. Receive three words: `sunset-bicycle-ocean`
4. Tell the recipient: "Go to send.sgraph.ai and enter sunset-bicycle-ocean"

**Recipient:**
1. Go to `send.sgraph.ai`
2. Enter `sunset-bicycle-ocean`
3. File is located and decrypted
4. Download completes

### 2.3 UX Comparison: Five Dimensions

#### Dimension 1: Voice Sharing

| Criterion | Current URL flow | Three-word key |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Can be shared over a phone call | No | **Yes** |
| Can be shared in a meeting | No | **Yes** |
| Can be dictated to someone writing it down | No | **Yes** |
| Can be shared via voice message | No | **Yes** |
| Error rate when communicated verbally | N/A (impossible) | **Low** (common English words) |

**Verdict:** The three-word key unlocks an entire sharing channel that currently does not exist. Voice sharing is not a niche use case -- it is how many professional interactions happen. A lawyer on the phone with a client saying "I am sending you the contract, the password is sunset-bicycle-ocean" is a fundamentally different experience from "I am sending you a link, check your email."

This is the single most impactful UX improvement the concept offers.

#### Dimension 2: Mobile Experience

| Criterion | Current URL flow | Three-word key |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Typing on mobile | Impractical (URL too long) | **Easy** (three short words) |
| Autocorrect interference | High (random characters trigger corrections) | **Low** (real English words autocomplete correctly) |
| Copy-paste on mobile | Works but requires switching apps | Works, but **three words are easier to remember across app switches** |
| SMS character limit | URL may be split across messages | **Three words fit easily** |
| QR code alternative | Yes (encode URL in QR) | Yes (encode three words in QR) -- **simpler QR content** |

**Verdict:** Mobile is the dominant computing platform. Any feature that reduces friction on mobile is disproportionately valuable. Three-word keys are naturally mobile-friendly because they work with the device's input method (keyboard with autocomplete) rather than against it.

#### Dimension 3: Memorability

| Criterion | Current URL flow | Three-word key |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Can be memorised | No | **Yes** (3-5 minutes of short-term retention) |
| Can be recalled after a brief interruption | No | **Yes** ("What was it? sunset-bicycle-ocean. Right.") |
| Can be written from memory | No | **Yes** |
| Susceptible to transcription errors | N/A (not transcribed) | **Low** (real words are self-correcting -- "sunset" is harder to misspell than "K7xPm9") |

**Verdict:** Memorability matters in scenarios where the sender and recipient are not in the same digital context. If the sender is at a desk and the recipient is in a warehouse, in a car, or at a different computer without shared messaging, a memorable key is the difference between "I can access this now" and "I need to wait until I can check my email."

The typical human can hold three unrelated concrete nouns in working memory for several minutes. This is well within the cognitive load research on short-term memory (Miller's "7 plus or minus 2" for chunks, with three concrete nouns being three chunks).

#### Dimension 4: Sharing Channel Flexibility

| Sharing Channel | Current URL flow | Three-word key |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Email | Works | Works |
| Chat/messaging | Works | Works |
| Phone call | **Does not work** | Works |
| In-person verbal | **Does not work** | Works |
| SMS | Works (but long) | Works (short) |
| Written note | **Impractical** | Works |
| Radio/intercom | **Does not work** | Works |
| Screenshare | Works (visible on screen) | Works |

**Verdict:** The current URL flow works in exactly two categories: digital text channels where the URL can be copied, and visual channels where the URL can be seen. Three-word keys work in every channel available to humans. This is a fundamental expansion of the product's usability surface.

#### Dimension 5: User Confidence

| Criterion | Current URL flow | Three-word key |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| User understands what they are sharing | **Low** (opaque URL, unclear what the hash fragment is) | **High** ("these three words are the password") |
| User feels in control | **Medium** (they trust the URL does what it says) | **High** ("I chose these words" or "I know these words") |
| User can verify they shared correctly | **Hard** (compare long strings character by character) | **Easy** ("Did you say sunset-bicycle-ocean? Yes.") |
| Recipient trusts the mechanism | **Medium** (clicking a link from someone) | **Higher** ("They told me the password, I entered it myself") |

**Verdict:** Three-word keys give users a sense of ownership and control that URLs do not. The act of speaking or typing three words feels like using a password -- a concept everyone understands. The act of clicking a URL feels like trusting a machine. The psychological difference matters for adoption.

### 2.4 UX Risks and Concerns

The Advocate must also flag where three-word keys create new UX problems:

**Risk 1: Collision anxiety.** "What if someone else guesses my three words?" Users will worry about this. The UI must communicate the probability clearly: "There are [X] million possible combinations. Your file expires in [Y] hours." This is where AppSec's entropy analysis directly affects UX -- the Advocate needs the numbers to design the confidence message.

**Risk 2: Word ambiguity.** Some words sound alike ("their/there", "to/two/too"). The word list must be curated for phonetic distinctness. This is a UX constraint that should be fed to the Architect: the dictionary must optimise for verbal clarity, not just entropy.

**Risk 3: Internationalisation.** "sunset-bicycle-ocean" assumes English. What about users who share across languages? The word list being in English creates a barrier for non-English speakers. This is not a blocker for v1 (the product UI is in English), but it is a consideration for the design: should words be language-neutral (concrete nouns that translate easily) or should we offer localised word lists?

**Risk 4: Two-flow confusion.** If three-word keys exist alongside URL sharing, users must choose. "Do I share the link or the three words?" Any time you give users a choice that they do not understand the implications of, you create friction. The Advocate recommends that three-word keys be an alternative sharing method on the result screen, not a mode the user selects before upload. Upload once, get both options: "Share this link" and "Or tell them: sunset-bicycle-ocean."

**Risk 5: Discoverability of the entry point.** The recipient needs to know to go to `send.sgraph.ai` and enter the words somewhere. The current flow is a single click on a URL. The three-word flow requires the recipient to navigate to a site and find an input field. The landing page must prominently feature a "Have a three-word key? Enter it here" input field -- visible immediately, not hidden behind navigation.

### 2.5 UX Recommendation

**The Advocate strongly supports exploring the three-word key concept.** It solves a real usability problem (verbal sharing, mobile sharing, memorability) that the current URL-only approach cannot address. The UX improvement is not incremental -- it is categorical. It opens sharing channels that are currently impossible.

However, the Advocate recommends the following conditions:

1. **Do not replace URL sharing.** Three-word keys should be an additional option, not a replacement. Power users and digital-native workflows benefit from the URL approach. Three-word keys serve a different context.

2. **AppSec must confirm acceptable entropy.** The Advocate cannot recommend a feature that users will rely on if the security is insufficient. The UX confidence messaging depends entirely on the numbers. If three words from a 2048-word dictionary provide only 33 bits of entropy, and that is insufficient for the threat model, the concept must be modified (four words? five words? words plus digits?) before shipping.

3. **The word list is a UX artefact, not just a technical one.** The words must be concrete nouns (easy to visualise and remember), phonetically distinct (easy to say over the phone), culturally neutral (no words with negative connotations in common languages), and short (ideally 4-8 characters each). The Advocate should review the word list before it ships.

4. **The recipient entry point must be prominent.** A three-word input field on the landing page, above the fold: "Have a code? Enter it here." This also serves double duty -- it communicates that the product has a sharing mechanism, which is a trust signal for Dani (the curious evaluator).

5. **Consider user-chosen vs. system-generated words.** User-chosen words are more memorable but have lower entropy (people choose predictable words). System-generated words are higher entropy but less personal. The Advocate recommends system-generated with a "regenerate" option -- the user gets randomness but can re-roll until they get a combination they like.

## 3. User Segment Analysis: Who Benefits Most

### 3.1 Persona-by-Persona Impact

| Persona | Impact | Rationale |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Sofia** (Security Pro) | **Medium** | Sofia already operates in digital-text channels (email, secure messaging). She values the URL approach because it is self-contained and she can verify the hash fragment. Three-word keys are useful when she is on a call with a client and needs to share a file immediately, but this is a secondary use case for her. She will want assurance that three-word entropy is "enough" for her files. |
| **Marcus** (Large File Sender) | **High** | Marcus works in creative/technical teams where verbal handoffs are common. "I uploaded the renders, the code is sunset-bicycle-ocean" is exactly how his workflow operates. He is often on calls, in Slack huddles, or in person when file sharing happens. Three-word keys match his communication patterns. |
| **Priya** (Enterprise Admin) | **Medium-High** | Priya cares about this for her team, not herself. If her team members can share files by saying three words in a meeting instead of fumbling with URLs, adoption goes up. Higher adoption means her investment in the tool is justified. Priya also sees the admin potential: three-word keys in the audit log are more readable than hashes. |
| **Alex** (Casual Sender) | **Very High** | Alex is the persona who sends files from their phone, who shares things over WhatsApp voice messages, who tells their friend "go to this website and type sunset-bicycle-ocean." The three-word flow reduces the cognitive load to almost zero. Alex does not understand URLs, hash fragments, or encryption keys. Alex understands passwords. Three words are a password. |
| **Dani** (Curious Evaluator) | **High (indirect)** | Dani does not use three-word keys directly (Dani has not sent a file yet). But the presence of a three-word input field on the landing page communicates something powerful: "This product has a simple sharing mechanism. It is not just another file-upload form." The three-word concept is inherently intriguing -- it invites the question "How does that work?" which is exactly the curiosity the landing page needs to generate. |

### 3.2 Use Cases Where Three-Word Keys Transform the Experience

**Use Case 1: Phone-based sharing (non-technical users)**
A solicitor calls their client: "I have sent you the contract. Go to send.sgraph.ai and type in marble-garden-river." The client, who may be elderly, non-technical, or on a basic phone, can do this. They cannot click a URL they received via email because they are on the phone, not at their email.

**Use Case 2: In-person handoff**
A photographer at a wedding: "I have uploaded the preview shots. The code is compass-thunder-silk." Spoken across a room. Written on a napkin. No phones need to change hands.

**Use Case 3: Broadcast sharing**
A teacher in a classroom: "I have uploaded the homework resources. The code is forest-lighthouse-drum." Thirty students can access the same file without thirty individual link shares.

**Use Case 4: Cross-device transfer**
A user at their work computer uploads a file. They want to download it on their phone. Instead of emailing themselves a URL, they remember "crystal-anchor-breeze" and type it on their phone. Self-sharing becomes frictionless.

**Use Case 5: Customer support**
A support agent: "I am sending you the update package. Go to send.sgraph.ai and enter coral-violin-meadow." The customer is already on the phone with support. No need to switch to email, no need to spell out a URL character by character.

### 3.3 Segments Ranked by Benefit

| Rank | User Segment | Why Three-Word Keys Matter Most |
|------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| 1 | **Non-technical users receiving files** | They struggle with long URLs, do not understand hash fragments, and often cannot copy-paste reliably. Three words are within their capability. |
| 2 | **Phone-based sharing scenarios** | Any context where the sender and recipient are on a voice call, voice message, or in-person conversation. This is a large and underserved segment. |
| 3 | **Mobile-primary users** | Users who primarily operate from phones, where URL handling is inconsistent across apps (some apps mangle long URLs, some truncate hash fragments). Three words survive any messaging format. |
| 4 | **Broadcast/classroom/team sharing** | One sender, many recipients. A spoken or projected three-word key reaches everyone simultaneously. Sharing individual URLs with 30 people is painful. |
| 5 | **Cross-device self-transfer** | Users sending files to themselves across devices. Currently requires email or messaging to move the URL. Three words can be remembered. |

## 4. Carryover Items from v0.3.2

The following items from the [v0.3.2 Advocate action plan](../26-02-14/v0.3.2__action-plan__explorer-next-steps.md) remain active. The v0.3.10 brief does not supersede or close any of them.

### 4.1 Landing Page Analysis (Gap G1 from v0.3.2)

**Status:** OPEN -- remains the Advocate's top priority recommendation.

The v0.3.10 brief does not address the landing page. The six P1 UX bugs in the brief are all mid-flow problems (download page loading, token expiry, token-aware state, upload progress, navigation guards, Analytics Pulse). None of them address the first-contact experience.

The Advocate reiterates: **the landing page is the highest-leverage UX surface.** Every new user encounters it. Every recipient-to-sender conversion depends on it. The design agency brief from the Designer role ([v0.3.3](../../designer/reviews/26-02-15/v0.3.3__brief__cruz-and-cruz-design-agency.md)) should incorporate the three-level messaging hierarchy from the v0.3.2 Advocate review (Section 2.3):

1. **Hook** (3 seconds): "Send files that only you and your recipient can open."
2. **Explanation** (10 seconds): How client-side encryption works in plain English.
3. **Proof** (30 seconds): "Verify it yourself in DevTools."

If three-word keys proceed, the landing page gains a fourth element: a prominent input field ("Have a code? Enter it here") that simultaneously serves recipients and communicates the product's simplicity to first-time visitors.

### 4.2 Persona Framework

**Status:** ACTIVE -- the five personas (Sofia, Marcus, Priya, Alex, Dani) defined in the v0.3.2 action plan are the framework used in this document's three-word key analysis. No changes to the personas are needed based on the v0.3.10 brief.

The three-word key concept reinforces Marcus and Alex as the highest-impact personas for new features. Sofia values security rigour over convenience. Marcus and Alex value convenience that does not compromise security. Three-word keys serve Marcus and Alex directly.

### 4.3 "Why Not WeTransfer?" Messaging

**Status:** OPEN -- no progress in the v0.3.10 brief.

The three-word key concept adds a new differentiation point. WeTransfer does not offer verbal-friendly file sharing. The comparison becomes:

| Capability | WeTransfer | SGraph Send |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Send a file | Yes | Yes |
| Encrypted in browser | No | Yes |
| Share via link | Yes | Yes |
| Share by saying three words | No | **Yes** (proposed) |
| No account required | Yes (free tier) | Yes |
| No tracking | No (GA + cookies) | Yes |

"Share by saying three words" is a differentiator that is immediately understandable, immediately compelling, and impossible to confuse with WeTransfer. This is the kind of feature that makes "Why not WeTransfer?" easy to answer.

### 4.4 Unencrypted Mode ("Express Mode") Recommendation

**Status:** OPEN -- recommendation unchanged. Do not ship unencrypted mode until (a) encrypted large file transfer works reliably, (b) admin policy controls exist, and (c) the brand is established enough to survive the messaging complexity.

The v0.3.10 brief's upload/download resilience research (P2, Task #19) is the prerequisite. When chunked uploads, retry logic, and streaming encryption are working, Marcus's need for "unencrypted mode" may largely disappear -- his real need is reliability, not the absence of encryption.

### 4.5 Previous Recommendation Status

Carrying forward from v0.3.2:

| Rec | Description | Status | Notes |
|-----|-------------|--------|-------|
| A-01 | Landing page content | OPEN | Remains top priority. Not addressed in v0.3.10. |
| A-02 | localStorage disclosure | OPEN | No change. |
| A-03 | LaunchList third-party script | OPEN | Contradicts "no third-party scripts" claim. |
| A-04 | Keyboard accessibility | OPEN | Included in design agency accessibility requirements. |
| A-05 | aria-live regions | OPEN | Included in design agency accessibility requirements. |
| A-06 | SGMETA filename verification | UNKNOWN | Needs verification. |
| A-07 | URL rewriting (version paths visible) | OPEN | No change. |
| A-08 | RTL readiness | OPEN | Included in design agency requirements. |
| A-09 to A-12 | Pre-launch priorities | OPEN | Not blocking current work. |

## 5. Brief-Wide UX Observations

### 5.1 The Six P1 Bugs Are All UX Issues

This is worth calling out explicitly. The brief's P1 list:

| # | P1 Bug | UX Category |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Download page shows mailing list instead of loading state | **First impression failure** -- the recipient's first encounter with the product is wrong content |
| 2 | Token expiry causes silent redirect with no message | **Silent failure** -- the user has no idea what happened or what to do |
| 3 | Download page shows "join" prompt to users who already have tokens | **Context blindness** -- the UI does not know who the user is |
| 4 | Analytics Pulse not working | **Admin trust erosion** -- the first thing an admin looks at is broken |
| 5 | Upload progress bar lacks granularity | **Perceived hang** -- the user thinks the product is frozen when it is actually working |
| 6 | No navigation guard during uploads | **Silent data loss** -- the user can accidentally destroy their in-progress transfer |

Every one of these is a UX problem, not a backend problem. The infrastructure works. The encryption works. The storage works. What does not work is the conversation between the product and the user.

This is a pattern worth recognising: **the product has graduated from "does it work?" to "does it communicate?"** The technical foundation is solid (111+ tests, end-to-end flow working, privacy by design validated). The UX layer is where the product is failing its users.

### 5.2 The UX Maturity Shift

The v0.3.10 brief represents a significant maturity shift in the project's UX thinking. Consider:

- **v0.1.x:** "Can we encrypt and upload a file?" (technical proof of concept)
- **v0.2.x:** "Can a real user complete the flow?" (functional proof of concept)
- **v0.3.x:** "Does the product communicate its state, intent, and value to the user at every moment?" (UX proof of concept)

The six P1 bugs are all v0.3.x problems -- they are about communication, not capability. The three-word key concept is also a communication innovation: it changes how users communicate file access to each other.

The Advocate reads this brief as the project entering the "UX is the product" phase. The encryption, the storage, the Lambda architecture -- these are necessary but no longer differentiating. What differentiates now is whether the user understands what is happening, feels confident about it, and can share the experience with others.

### 5.3 UX Implications of the Server Analytics Dashboard

The SA dashboard is framed in the brief as an admin/developer tool, but it has UX implications for the product as a whole:

1. **The cache browser is a UX debugging tool.** When a user reports a problem ("my upload seemed to hang"), the admin can inspect the cache to see exactly what happened. This closes the feedback loop between user experience and system state.

2. **Path-based routing (D038) is a UX decision, not just a technical one.** The brief's rationale -- bookmarkable, shareable, predictable URLs -- is a UX argument. The Advocate endorses this decision. REST-style URLs are inherently more usable than hash-fragment navigation because they are self-documenting.

3. **The three missing UI elements (API call log, event log, message panel) are UX observability tools.** They let the developer see what the user sees. This is critical for a product where the UX layer is the primary area of improvement.

### 5.4 The Upload/Download Resilience Research Is a UX Research Task

The brief frames the resilience research (Task #19) as a technical investigation (chunked uploads, retry logic, streaming encryption). The Advocate notes that every item in the research scope is also a UX requirement:

| Technical requirement | UX requirement |
|----------------------|----------------|
| Chunked uploads | Progress bar that moves smoothly, not in bursts |
| Retry logic per chunk | "Retrying..." message instead of silent failure |
| Resume capability | "Your upload was interrupted. Resume?" instead of "start over" |
| Checksum verification | "File integrity verified" confirmation that builds trust |
| Bandwidth estimation | Accurate time remaining ("2 minutes left" not "calculating...") |
| Cancel/pause/resume | User-accessible controls, not just technical capability |
| Error reporting | Human-readable error messages, not HTTP status codes |

The Architect and Dev should not produce a research document that is purely technical. The Advocate requests that the research document include a section on the user-facing implications of each architectural choice. The best architecture for resilience is the one that gives the user the most confidence and control.

### 5.5 Overall UX Direction Assessment

The Advocate's assessment of the project's UX direction as of v0.3.10:

**What is going well:**
- The brief shows strong UX awareness from the project lead. All six P1 items are user-experience problems, correctly identified and correctly prioritised.
- Privacy by design is validated -- the DPO role prevented IP capture in logging. This is a UX feature even though users never see it: the product can truthfully claim "we do not capture your IP address."
- The three-word key concept shows the project is thinking about UX innovation, not just UX polish. This is an idea that could genuinely differentiate the product.
- The SA dashboard with path-based routing shows UX discipline being applied to internal tools, not just user-facing ones.

**What needs attention:**
- The landing page remains unaddressed. Every P1 bug in this brief is a mid-flow problem. The pre-flow problem (what does the user see before they start?) is still open. This is the single highest-impact gap.
- The brief contains 22 tasks, 7 of them P1. The Dev role carries 20 tasks. There is a risk that the volume of work causes "fix it fast" shortcuts that trade long-term UX quality for short-term bug closure. The Advocate recommends that each P1 bug fix include a brief UX review (even 5 minutes) before merging to ensure the fix actually solves the user's problem, not just the technical symptom.
- Token acquisition for new users (Gap G6 from v0.3.2) is still unresolved. The product requires a token to use. Until there is a demo mode, trial token, or public access tier, the product cannot convert curious visitors into users.

**Recommended UX priorities for the Conductor:**

| Priority | Action | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Ship the six P1 bug fixes | These are active user pain points. Every session encounters at least one. |
| 2 | Landing page content (A-01) | The design agency engagement is the right moment to address this. Feed the three-level messaging hierarchy into the agency brief. |
| 3 | Three-word key exploration | Contingent on AppSec security review. If approved, this is the most compelling UX feature on the roadmap. |
| 4 | Upload/download resilience UX spec | Ensure the resilience research includes user-facing requirements, not just technical architecture. |
| 5 | Token acquisition path for new users | Before any public launch or marketing push, Dani needs a way in without a token. |

---

## 6. Coordination with Other Roles

| Role | What the Advocate needs | What the Advocate provides |
|------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **AppSec** | Three-word key entropy analysis and security classification. Specifically: how many bits of entropy do three words from a curated dictionary provide? Is this acceptable for files with a 24-hour expiry? What threat models does this satisfy vs. not satisfy? | This UX evaluation. The Advocate's recommendation is contingent on AppSec's numbers. |
| **Architect** | Technical feasibility of three-word keys. Can lookup and decryption be derived from the same three words? What is the collision probability? What is the word list size needed for acceptable entropy? | UX constraints for the word list: phonetic distinctness, concrete nouns, cultural neutrality, 4-8 character length. UX requirement for the recipient entry point: prominent input field on landing page. |
| **Designer** | Incorporation of three-word key concept into design agency brief (if AppSec approves). Landing page mockup that includes both the messaging hierarchy and a three-word input field. | Persona impact analysis (Section 3). Use case scenarios (Section 3.2). Landing page element requirements. |
| **Dev** | UX review opportunity before P1 bug fix PRs merge. The Advocate wants to verify that the fix addresses the user's experience, not just the technical symptom. | Specific UX criteria for each P1 bug (Section 5.1 -- the UX category column). |
| **Conductor** | Alignment on the UX priority list (Section 5.5). Confirmation that landing page content is tracked alongside the P1 bugs even though it was not in this brief. | This document as a prioritised UX backlog input. |

---

## 7. Summary

The three-word key concept is the most user-impactful feature idea in the v0.3.10 brief. It transforms file sharing from a digital-only, link-dependent activity into something that works across every human communication channel: voice, in-person, written notes, mobile, broadcast. The user segments that benefit most are non-technical recipients, phone-based sharing scenarios, and mobile-primary users. Alex (casual sender) and Marcus (large file sender) see the greatest UX improvement; Dani (curious evaluator) benefits indirectly through landing page discoverability.

The concept must clear AppSec review before proceeding. The Advocate's support is conditional on acceptable entropy, a curated word list, and the feature being additive (alongside URL sharing, not replacing it).

The six P1 bugs in the brief are all UX problems, signalling that the project has matured past "does it work?" into "does it communicate?" The Advocate welcomes this shift and recommends that UX review become a standard step in bug fix workflows.

The landing page (A-01) remains the Advocate's top open recommendation. The three-word key concept, if approved, strengthens the landing page case by adding a visible, intriguing entry point that communicates the product's simplicity before the user has done anything.

Carryover items (persona framework, WeTransfer messaging, Express Mode recommendation, accessibility requirements) remain open and unchanged.
