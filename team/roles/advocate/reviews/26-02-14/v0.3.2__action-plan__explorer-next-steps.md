# Advocate Action Plan: Explorer Next Steps

**Version:** v0.3.2
**Date:** 14 February 2026
**Role:** Advocate (Explorer Team)
**Session scope:** Design agency personas (P1), "Why not WeTransfer?" analysis (P2), unencrypted mode evaluation (P3), accessibility review plan, user feedback loop, user journey gap analysis
**Previous review:** [v0.2.33 -- v0.1.3 Wrap-Up and LinkedIn](../26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md)
**Input brief:** [v0.3.2 Daily Brief](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/14/v0.3.2__daily-brief__sgraph-send-14-feb-2026.md)

## Executive Summary

The MVP works end to end. A real user watched it work. That same user immediately asked: "Why not just use WeTransfer?" That question -- and the unprompted identification of large file transfers as the real sweet spot -- tells us exactly where the Advocate's work must focus.

This action plan covers six areas: user personas for the design agency, the WeTransfer differentiation problem, the unencrypted mode question, accessibility requirements for the design agency, a feedback loop structure, and an analysis of user journey friction based on the v0.3.2 brief.

The central thesis: **SGraph Send's value becomes obvious when the user has something to protect. The product must communicate "what do you have to protect?" before it communicates "how we protect it."**

## 1. Design Agency Brief: User Personas (P1)

### 1.1 Why Personas Matter for the Design Agency

The design agency will make hundreds of micro-decisions: colour choices, layout hierarchy, typography weight, illustration style, button copy. Every decision should be answerable by asking: "What would [persona name] need here?" Without personas, those decisions default to the designer's instincts. With personas, they default to the user's needs.

The design agency needs personas that are:
- **Visual** -- a name, a face concept, a one-sentence tagline
- **Behavioural** -- what they do, not just who they are
- **Decision-driven** -- what makes them choose SGraph Send over doing nothing
- **Friction-aware** -- where they will get stuck and want to leave

### 1.2 The Five Core Personas

These build on the four personas established in the [v0.2.33 Advocate review](../26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md) (Security-Conscious Professional, Compliance Officer, Freelancer/Consultant, Technical User) and add new personas identified from the v0.3.2 brief feedback.

---

#### Persona 1: "Sofia" -- The Security-Conscious Professional

**Tagline:** "I need to send this, and I need to know nobody else can read it."

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Role** | Lawyer, CISO, financial advisor, healthcare professional |
| **File types** | Contracts, financial reports, medical records, board materials, HR documents |
| **File sizes** | 1--50 MB typically; occasional 100+ MB document bundles |
| **Current tools** | Email attachments (reluctantly), enterprise file share (slow, complex), WeTransfer (convenient but unsecure) |
| **Primary motivation** | Regulatory obligation or professional duty of care. She must prove the transfer was secure. |
| **Trust signals she checks** | Cookie policy, network requests in DevTools, privacy policy specifics, third-party scripts |
| **Decision trigger** | A client asks "How are you sending me this?" and she needs a better answer than "email." |
| **Friction tolerance** | HIGH for security features (she will read explanations). LOW for unnecessary steps (she will not create an account if there is an alternative). |
| **WeTransfer comparison** | She knows WeTransfer is not encrypted. She does not use it for sensitive files. She currently has no convenient secure alternative. SGraph Send fills that gap -- if she trusts it. |
| **Design implications** | Needs visible trust indicators. Wants to see "how it works" without being forced to read it. Values professionalism in visual design -- a polished UI is itself a trust signal. Needs the ability to explain to recipients why she chose this tool. |

**What the design agency must understand:** Sofia's trust is the hardest to earn and the most valuable to have. If the design makes the product look like a side project, Sofia will not use it regardless of the underlying technology. The design must communicate "enterprise-grade" without communicating "enterprise-complex."

---

#### Persona 2: "Marcus" -- The Large File Sender

**Tagline:** "I have a 5 GB file and no way to get it from here to there."

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Role** | Video editor, architect (CAD files), game developer, photographer, data scientist |
| **File types** | Video files, CAD drawings, raw photos, datasets, VM images, database exports |
| **File sizes** | 1--20 GB is the core range. Some files exceed 50 GB. |
| **Current tools** | WeTransfer Pro (2 GB limit on free), Google Drive (slow upload, requires account), physical USB drives (yes, still), Dropbox (file size limits), rsync/scp (technical users only) |
| **Primary motivation** | Getting the file there at all. Reliability, not security, is the primary concern. |
| **Trust signals he checks** | Upload progress, retry capability, estimated time, file integrity confirmation |
| **Decision trigger** | An upload fails at 80% on another service. He searches for "send large file" and finds SGraph Send. |
| **Friction tolerance** | HIGH for upload reliability features (progress bars, resume, checksum). VERY LOW for anything that slows the transfer (unnecessary encryption when speed matters more). |
| **WeTransfer comparison** | WeTransfer is his current default. He hits the 2 GB free limit regularly. He does not want to pay for Pro. If SGraph Send handles large files reliably, that alone is reason to switch. |
| **Design implications** | Needs prominent progress indication. Upload reliability must be visible ("Upload can resume if interrupted"). File size limits (or the absence of them) should be communicated before upload begins. |

**What the design agency must understand:** Marcus does not care about encryption -- until he does. His primary need is utility (get the file there). His secondary need is security (for some files). The design must serve the primary need first and present security as a bonus, not a prerequisite.

**This is the persona the v0.3.2 user feedback describes.** The unprompted "this becomes really useful for big files" comment maps directly to Marcus. He is possibly the most commercially important persona because his pain point has the widest addressable market.

---

#### Persona 3: "Priya" -- The Enterprise Admin

**Tagline:** "I need to give my team secure file sharing without another SaaS subscription."

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Role** | IT administrator, team lead, department head at a mid-size company |
| **File types** | Varied -- whatever her team needs to send. She manages the tool, not the files. |
| **File sizes** | Varies by team member |
| **Current tools** | SharePoint (painful), email (insecure), "approved" enterprise tools (slow to procure), shadow IT (WeTransfer, personal Dropbox) |
| **Primary motivation** | Control. She wants to know who sent what, when, to whom. She wants a token system that lets her provision and revoke access. |
| **Trust signals she checks** | Admin interface quality, audit trail availability, token/access management, deployment options (self-hosted?) |
| **Decision trigger** | A security audit reveals her team is using WeTransfer for client deliverables. She needs a secure alternative she can deploy this week, not in three months after procurement review. |
| **Friction tolerance** | HIGH for admin features (she will learn a complex admin interface). LOW for user-facing complexity (her team will not read documentation). |
| **WeTransfer comparison** | WeTransfer Business is an option, but it is a SaaS subscription with data residency questions. SGraph Send with self-hosting potential and token-based access is more attractive for security-conscious orgs. |
| **Design implications** | The admin interface is her primary interaction surface. It must be functional, clear, and convey control. The user-facing interface must be simple enough that she does not need to train her team. |

**What the design agency must understand:** Priya evaluates on behalf of others. She needs two things: an admin experience that gives her confidence, and a user experience so simple her team will actually use it. If either fails, the whole evaluation fails.

---

#### Persona 4: "Alex" -- The Casual Sender

**Tagline:** "I just want to send this file. Don't make me think."

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Role** | Anyone. Student, parent, small business owner, friend sending holiday photos. |
| **File types** | Anything -- photos, documents, presentations, music files |
| **File sizes** | Typically under 500 MB |
| **Current tools** | Email (for small files), WhatsApp (for photos), WeTransfer (for medium files), Google Drive (if they have an account) |
| **Primary motivation** | Speed and simplicity. Zero friction. Send and forget. |
| **Trust signals they check** | Almost none initially. They trust based on visual impression: "Does this look legitimate?" A professional, clean design IS the trust signal. |
| **Decision trigger** | Someone sends them a file via SGraph Send (viral loop). They see the "Want to send files too?" CTA after downloading. |
| **Friction tolerance** | VERY LOW. Every additional step (create account, enter token, understand encryption) is a drop-off point. |
| **WeTransfer comparison** | WeTransfer is the gold standard for this persona. The experience is: drag, drop, enter email, send. Anything more complex than this loses Alex. |
| **Design implications** | The upload flow must be visually obvious. The encryption step must not feel like an obstacle. The result (a shareable link) must appear immediately and be easy to copy. No jargon. No explanations unless requested. |

**What the design agency must understand:** Alex is the volume persona. Every recipient is a potential Alex. The viral loop depends on Alex being able to send a file within 30 seconds of deciding to try. The design must optimise for this 30-second window.

---

#### Persona 5: "Dani" -- The Curious Evaluator

**Tagline:** "I saw something interesting and clicked through. Convince me."

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Role** | LinkedIn contact, conference attendee, blog reader, someone who heard about SGraph Send through word-of-mouth |
| **File types** | None yet -- they have not decided to use the product |
| **Current tools** | Whatever they currently use. They are not looking to switch. |
| **Primary motivation** | Curiosity. They want to understand what this is and whether it is relevant to them. |
| **Trust signals they check** | First impression. Does it look real? Does it look professional? Does it explain itself? |
| **Decision trigger** | The landing page answers "What is this? Why should I care? How do I try it?" within 10 seconds. |
| **Friction tolerance** | ZERO. If the product does not explain itself immediately, Dani leaves. They have no sunk cost, no commitment, no reason to figure it out. |
| **WeTransfer comparison** | Dani knows WeTransfer. If SGraph Send looks like "another WeTransfer," Dani has no reason to stay. The differentiation must be instant and compelling. |
| **Design implications** | The landing page is Dani's only interaction. It must communicate the value proposition before asking for any action. A demo mode or preview would convert curiosity into engagement. The "what makes this different" message must be above the fold. |

**What the design agency must understand:** Dani is the persona the landing page is for. Every other persona eventually becomes Dani when they first encounter the product. The landing page design determines whether Dani becomes Sofia, Marcus, Priya, or Alex -- or leaves forever.

This persona was previously identified as the "Community Member" in the [v0.2.33 review](../26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md) (Section 4.2) and is now formally named and expanded.

### 1.3 Persona Summary for Design Agency Brief

| Persona | Name | Core need | File size | Security priority | Friction tolerance |
|---------|------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Security Pro | Sofia | Provable security | 1--50 MB | PRIMARY | High for security, low for admin |
| Large File Sender | Marcus | Reliable transfer | 1--20+ GB | Secondary | High for reliability, very low for friction |
| Enterprise Admin | Priya | Control and provisioning | Varied | High (org-level) | High for admin, low for users |
| Casual Sender | Alex | Simplicity | < 500 MB | Not considered | Very low |
| Curious Evaluator | Dani | Understanding | None | Not considered | Zero |

### 1.4 Persona Deliverable for Design Agency

The design agency should receive:
1. **One-page persona cards** (one per persona) with name, tagline, photo concept, key attributes, and design implications
2. **A user journey map per persona** showing their path through the product (see Section 6 below)
3. **A "moments that matter" matrix** showing which UI screens are critical for which persona
4. **A friction hierarchy** showing where each persona's patience runs out

---

## 2. "Why Not WeTransfer?" Analysis (P2)

### 2.1 The Problem

The user's first reaction was "Why are we reinventing WeTransfer?" This is simultaneously the best and worst possible feedback:

- **Best** because it means the file-sharing utility is immediately understood. The mental model is correct.
- **Worst** because it means the differentiation is invisible. The user sees a WeTransfer clone, not a zero-knowledge encryption tool.

### 2.2 What Users Actually Care About (Ranked)

Based on the v0.3.2 feedback, the previous Advocate review, and the Ambassador's competitive analysis, here is what each persona cares about when comparing to WeTransfer:

| Rank | Concern | Who cares most | WeTransfer answer | SGraph Send answer |
|------|---------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | "Can I actually get the file there?" | Marcus, Alex | Yes, up to 2 GB free | Yes, no meaningful limit (S3 backend) |
| 2 | "Is it simple enough?" | Alex, Dani | Yes -- drag, drop, email, done | Not yet -- encryption step adds friction |
| 3 | "Is it actually secure?" | Sofia, Priya | No (server-side plaintext) | Yes (client-side encryption, zero knowledge) |
| 4 | "Can I control access?" | Priya | Limited (WeTransfer Business) | Yes (token system, admin console) |
| 5 | "Does it track me?" | Sofia, technical users | Yes (cookies, GA, tracking) | No (zero cookies, zero tracking) |
| 6 | "Does it work for large files?" | Marcus | 2 GB free, 200 GB Pro ($) | No limit in theory (needs chunked upload for reliability) |
| 7 | "Is it free?" | Alex, Marcus | Partially (2 GB limit) | Yes (token-based access) |

### 2.3 Communicating Zero-Knowledge Encryption Simply

The phrase "zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing" is jargon. It means nothing to Alex and Dani, and only partially registers with Marcus and Priya. Even Sofia, who understands the concept, may not recognise the phrase.

**Proposed communication hierarchy (what the landing page should say, in order):**

**Level 1 -- The hook (3 seconds, for everyone):**
> "Send files that only you and your recipient can open."

This communicates the outcome, not the mechanism. Every persona understands exclusivity. Nobody needs to know what AES-256-GCM means to understand "only you and your recipient."

**Level 2 -- The explanation (10 seconds, for those who want more):**
> "Your files are encrypted in your browser before they leave your device. The encryption key is never sent to our server. We literally cannot read your files -- even if we wanted to."

This communicates three things: where encryption happens (your browser), what the server never gets (the key), and what that means (we cannot read it). The last phrase -- "even if we wanted to" -- addresses the trust deficit directly.

**Level 3 -- The proof (30 seconds, for Sofia and technical users):**
> "Verify it yourself. Open your browser's developer tools. Check the Network tab during upload. You will see encrypted ciphertext, not your file. Check the Cookies tab. It is empty. Check the Application tab. No tracking scripts. Every claim we make is verifiable in your browser."

This is the Ambassador's "invite verification, not trust" principle applied to the landing page. It converts sceptics by giving them agency.

**Level 4 -- The technical detail (for those who dig deeper):**
> "AES-256-GCM encryption via the Web Crypto API. Keys derived from cryptographically random bytes. Hash-fragment URL distribution -- the key is in the URL fragment, which browsers never send to the server. No cookies. No localStorage tracking. No third-party scripts."

This is for the AppSec evaluator, the technical blogger, the compliance officer writing an assessment. It should be available but not prominent.

### 2.4 The "Why Not WeTransfer?" Landing Page Section

Based on the above, the landing page should include a section that directly addresses the comparison. The design agency needs to know this section exists and is a priority.

**Proposed structure:**

| Column | WeTransfer | SGraph Send |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Your files on the server | Readable by WeTransfer | Encrypted. Unreadable by anyone. |
| Cookies | Yes. Cookie banner required. | None. No banner. Verify in DevTools. |
| Tracking | Google Analytics + marketing pixels | Zero third-party scripts |
| Account required | No (free tier) | No |
| File size limit (free) | 2 GB | No meaningful limit |
| Who can read your files | WeTransfer, their infrastructure partners, anyone who compromises their server | Only someone with the link you share |

**Design guidance for the agency:** This comparison must not feel aggressive or competitive. It should feel factual and verifiable. The tone is "here is the difference" not "they are bad." Let the facts speak. Users respect honesty more than marketing.

### 2.5 The One-Line Differentiator

For all external communications, the Advocate recommends this differentiator be tested:

> **"WeTransfer sends your files. SGraph Send sends your files so that only your recipient can open them."**

This is simple, comparative (anchors on what users know), and communicates the core difference without jargon. The design agency should test this or a variant in their mockups.

---

## 3. Unencrypted Mode Evaluation (P3)

### 3.1 The User Perspective

Should SGraph Send offer an unencrypted mode? The brief presents compelling arguments on both sides. Here is the Advocate's evaluation from each persona's perspective.

#### Sofia (Security Pro): Against

Sofia chose SGraph Send because it is encrypted. An unencrypted mode does not serve her. Worse, it creates a risk: what if someone on her team accidentally sends a sensitive file in unencrypted mode? The existence of the option creates a new category of human error. Sofia's verdict: "I do not want this option to exist. It introduces a failure mode I have to train people to avoid."

#### Marcus (Large File Sender): Strongly For

Marcus does not care about encryption for most of his files. He is sending video rushes, CAD files, game builds -- large, non-sensitive data. The encryption step adds friction (processing time for large files, key management, the extra step in the UI). For Marcus, unencrypted mode means: faster upload, simpler workflow, fewer steps. Marcus's verdict: "Give me the option. I will use it 80% of the time."

#### Priya (Enterprise Admin): Conditional

Priya wants the option to exist but wants to control it. She wants to set a policy: "Our team always encrypts" or "Our team can choose." She wants the admin interface to surface which transfers were encrypted and which were not. Priya's verdict: "Let me control it at the organisation level. Do not let individual users decide without my knowledge."

#### Alex (Casual Sender): Indifferent

Alex does not know what encryption is. If the default is encrypted and it works seamlessly, Alex is fine. If the default is unencrypted and it works seamlessly, Alex is also fine. The only scenario where Alex has a preference is if encryption adds visible friction (a loading step, a separate key to manage, an extra click). Alex's verdict: "I do not care, as long as it does not slow me down."

#### Dani (Curious Evaluator): Confused

Dani arrives at the landing page. It says "zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing." Then there is a toggle that says "send without encryption." Dani thinks: "Wait, is this a security product or not? If they offer an unencrypted mode, how committed are they to security?" Dani's verdict: "This makes me trust the product less."

### 3.2 The Advocate's Recommendation

**Offer unencrypted mode, but not yet, and not as a toggle.**

The reasoning:

1. **Today, the value proposition is clarity.** "Your files are encrypted. Period." This is a clear, simple message. Introducing an unencrypted mode now -- before the encrypted mode is fully polished and the brand is established -- dilutes the message at the worst possible time.

2. **Large file transfer capability must come first.** Marcus's real need is not "unencrypted mode." It is "reliable large file transfer." If SGraph Send can handle 5 GB uploads with progress, retry, and integrity checks, Marcus will use the encrypted mode happily. The encryption overhead for a 5 GB file is not the bottleneck -- network reliability is. Solve the reliability problem first.

3. **When unencrypted mode eventually ships, it should be framed as "Express Mode" or "Quick Send."** Not "unencrypted mode." The framing matters. "Express Mode" communicates speed and convenience. "Unencrypted mode" communicates the absence of security. The feature is the same; the perception is entirely different.

4. **The default must always be encrypted.** The unencrypted option, when it arrives, should require an explicit, deliberate action to enable. Not a toggle. A separate workflow or a setting that says: "I understand this file will not be encrypted. Send anyway." Friction here is appropriate -- it should be harder to send unencrypted than encrypted.

5. **Priya's admin control is a prerequisite.** Before unencrypted mode ships to any team-use scenario, the admin interface must allow org-level policies: "Encryption required" / "Encryption optional" / "Encryption off." Without this control, unencrypted mode creates compliance liability.

### 3.3 Timeline Recommendation

| Phase | What to ship | Why |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| **Now (v0.3.x)** | Nothing. Keep encrypted-only. | The brand is not established enough to survive the messaging confusion. |
| **After large file transfer works (v0.5+)** | Evaluate again. If large files work reliably with encryption, the need for unencrypted mode may be reduced. | Solve the real problem (reliability) before solving the perceived problem (encryption overhead). |
| **When enterprise admin features are mature (v0.6+)** | Ship "Express Mode" with admin policy controls. | Priya can control it. Sofia's team is protected by policy. Marcus gets his option. |

### 3.4 What to Tell the Design Agency

The design agency should be aware that:
- The product is encryption-first. The default is always encrypted.
- An "express" or "quick" mode may be introduced later for non-sensitive large files.
- The design must make encryption feel like a feature, not an obstacle. It should never feel like something the user has to opt into or endure.
- If express mode ships, the design must make the security implications clear without being alarming. A calm, factual disclosure: "This file will be sent without encryption. Anyone with the link can access it."

---

## 4. Accessibility Review Plan

### 4.1 What the Design Agency Needs to Know on Day One

The [v0.2.33 Advocate review](../26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md) (Section 3) identified significant accessibility gaps in the current UI. The design agency must incorporate accessibility from the start, not retrofit it later.

### 4.2 Non-Negotiable Accessibility Requirements

These are requirements, not nice-to-haves. The design agency's deliverables must satisfy all of these.

| Requirement | WCAG Reference | Design Impact |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Colour contrast ratio of 4.5:1 minimum for all text** | WCAG 2.1 AA, SC 1.4.3 | All colour palette choices must be tested against contrast requirements. Provide contrast-passing combinations for every theme (Aurora, Glacier, Ember, dark, high-contrast). |
| **All interactive elements keyboard-accessible** | WCAG 2.1 A, SC 2.1.1 | The drag-and-drop zone must have a keyboard equivalent. All buttons, links, and form elements must be reachable via Tab and activatable via Enter/Space. Focus states must be visible. |
| **No information conveyed by colour alone** | WCAG 2.1 A, SC 1.4.1 | Status indicators (success, error, progress) must use icons or text in addition to colour. A colour-blind user must be able to distinguish success from error without seeing green vs. red. |
| **All images and icons have text alternatives** | WCAG 2.1 A, SC 1.1.1 | Every icon the design agency creates must have an associated alt text or aria-label specification in the design deliverable. |
| **Focus order matches visual order** | WCAG 2.1 A, SC 2.4.3 | The visual layout must follow a logical Tab order. Complex layouts (multi-column, overlapping elements) must specify the intended focus sequence. |
| **Touch targets minimum 44x44 CSS pixels** | WCAG 2.1 AAA, SC 2.5.5 (recommended AA) | All buttons, links, and interactive elements must be large enough for touch interaction. The current locale selector buttons are too small on mobile. |
| **Text resizable to 200% without loss of content** | WCAG 2.1 AA, SC 1.4.4 | The design must not break when text is scaled to 200%. Fixed-height containers that clip text are not acceptable. |
| **Motion and animation respect user preferences** | WCAG 2.1 AA, SC 2.3.3 | Any animations (progress bars, transitions, loading indicators) must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. The design should include a reduced-motion variant. |

### 4.3 Multi-Theme Accessibility Matrix

The brief mentions three visual themes (Aurora, Glacier, Ember) plus accessibility themes (dark mode, high contrast, colour-blind friendly). The design agency must deliver colour specifications that pass WCAG AA contrast for every combination:

| Theme | Background | Primary text | Secondary text | Interactive elements | Status: success | Status: error |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Aurora (default) | Specify | 4.5:1 min | 4.5:1 min | 4.5:1 min | 4.5:1 min | 4.5:1 min |
| Glacier | Specify | 4.5:1 min | 4.5:1 min | 4.5:1 min | 4.5:1 min | 4.5:1 min |
| Ember | Specify | 4.5:1 min | 4.5:1 min | 4.5:1 min | 4.5:1 min | 4.5:1 min |
| Dark mode | Specify | 4.5:1 min | 4.5:1 min | 4.5:1 min | 4.5:1 min | 4.5:1 min |
| High contrast | Specify | 7:1 min | 7:1 min | 7:1 min | 7:1 min | 7:1 min |
| Colour-blind safe | As Aurora | Must pass deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia simulation | Same | Same | Must be distinguishable without colour | Same |

**Deliverable requirement:** The design agency must provide a contrast verification table with actual hex values and measured contrast ratios for every cell above.

### 4.4 RTL Readiness

As noted in the [v0.2.33 review](../26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md) (Section 3.3), the current CSS uses directional properties that break in RTL layouts. The design agency should:

1. **Design all layouts using logical flow** -- "start" and "end" rather than "left" and "right"
2. **Provide at least one RTL mockup** for the upload and download pages, to verify the design works bidirectionally
3. **Avoid text embedded in images** -- all text must be rendered from locale files, never baked into design assets

### 4.5 Screen Reader Compatibility Requirements

The design agency's deliverables should include:
- **Heading hierarchy specification** -- which elements are `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, and in what order
- **Landmark regions** -- where `main`, `nav`, `aside`, and `footer` boundaries fall
- **ARIA live region placement** -- which status messages need to be announced to screen readers (upload progress, encryption status, success/error messages)
- **Focus management flows** -- where focus should move after state transitions (upload starts, upload completes, error occurs, download completes)

---

## 5. User Feedback Loop

### 5.1 The Design Agency as User Zero

The v0.3.2 brief proposes that the design agency should use SGraph Send to share deliverables. This is a brilliant move -- it makes the agency a real user and a continuous source of feedback. The Advocate's plan for this:

**Structured feedback capture:**

| Touchpoint | What to capture | How to capture | Owner |
|------------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| **First file shared via SGraph Send** | Time to first successful transfer, confusion points, comparison to their usual tool | Post-transfer debrief (5-minute call or async message) | Advocate + Sherpa |
| **First week of regular use** | Workflow friction, feature requests, what they wish was different | Short survey (5 questions max) or informal conversation | Advocate |
| **Every design deliverable exchange** | File sizes, upload success/failure, encryption experience, link sharing method | Automated via Sherpa trail data | Sherpa |
| **Monthly retrospective** | Overall experience, would they recommend to others, NPS-style question | Structured interview (15 minutes) | Advocate |

**Key questions to ask the design agency:**

1. "What did you try to do that you could not?" (uncovers missing features)
2. "What did you have to do that felt unnecessary?" (uncovers friction)
3. "What would you tell a friend about this tool?" (uncovers positioning)
4. "Would you use this for your other clients?" (uncovers product-market fit)
5. "What do you use instead of this, and why?" (uncovers competitive gaps)

### 5.2 Feedback from the Friendlies Programme

The token-based access system enables targeted feedback collection. The Advocate recommends the following feedback structure for the friendlies programme:

**After first transfer (automated):**
- "How was that? [Easy / Okay / Difficult]"
- "What would have made it easier?" (free text, optional)

**After fifth transfer (triggered):**
- "You have sent 5 files with SGraph Send. Would you recommend it to a colleague? [Yes / Maybe / No]"
- "What is the one thing you would change?" (free text)

**After first received file (recipient feedback):**
- "Someone just sent you a file via SGraph Send. Was the download experience [Smooth / Confusing / Broken]?"
- "Would you use SGraph Send to send your own files? [Yes / Maybe / No]"

These should be implemented as lightweight, non-blocking prompts in the UI -- not modal dialogs, not emails. They appear once, can be dismissed, and the response is captured via the event system for the Sherpa to analyse.

### 5.3 Feedback Channels

| Channel | Audience | Format | Frequency |
|---------|----------|--------|-----------|
| In-app micro-surveys | Active users (senders and recipients) | 1--2 question prompts after key moments | Triggered by behaviour (first send, fifth send, first download) |
| Design agency retros | Design agency team | Structured conversation | Monthly |
| Token-specific feedback | Community groups (per token) | Aggregated usage patterns + opt-in survey | Quarterly |
| Public feedback form | Anyone (linked from footer) | Open form: "Tell us what you think" | Always available |
| LinkedIn/social comments | Public audience | Monitored and catalogued by Sherpa | Ongoing |

---

## 6. User Journey Gaps

### 6.1 Analysis Based on v0.3.2 Brief Feedback

The v0.3.2 brief describes a successful end-to-end flow but the user feedback reveals several gaps. Here is the Advocate's analysis of each gap, mapped to personas.

---

#### Gap 1: The "What Is This?" Problem

**The gap:** The product does not explain itself within the first 10 seconds. The landing page says "Zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing" -- jargon that means nothing to Alex and Dani, and that even Sofia may not immediately connect to her need.

**Who is affected:** All personas, but Dani (the curious evaluator) most critically. Dani has zero commitment and will leave immediately if the product does not answer "What does this do? Why should I care?"

**Current state:** The upload page shows a title, a subtitle, and an access gate. There is no explanatory content, no value proposition, no "how it works" section. A first-time visitor must already know what SGraph Send is to use it.

**Recommended fix:** A landing page section above the access gate that communicates the three-level message from Section 2.3: the hook ("Send files that only you and your recipient can open"), the explanation (how encryption works in plain English), and the proof ("Verify it yourself").

**Priority:** P1. This was identified as the top recommendation (A-01) in the v0.2.33 Advocate review and remains the single most impactful improvement.

---

#### Gap 2: The WeTransfer Mental Model Mismatch

**The gap:** Users immediately compare to WeTransfer but cannot see the difference. The visual language, the workflow (drag, drop, share link), and the utility (send a file) are all WeTransfer-shaped. Nothing communicates "this is fundamentally different."

**Who is affected:** All personas during first encounter. Marcus especially -- he sees no reason to switch unless the differentiation is obvious.

**Current state:** No competitive differentiation is communicated anywhere in the UI. The subtitle "Zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing" is the only attempt, and it does not land.

**Recommended fix:** See Section 2.4 above. A "How SGraph Send is different" section with a factual, verifiable comparison. Not aggressive, not marketing-heavy -- just facts and the invitation to verify.

**Priority:** P2 (as per the brief), but the Advocate argues this is effectively P1 because it blocks user acquisition.

---

#### Gap 3: Large File Transfer Confidence

**The gap:** The user identified large file transfers as the sweet spot, but the current upload flow provides no confidence signals for large files: no progress bar with time estimate, no retry capability, no file size indication ("You can upload files up to X GB"), no integrity verification.

**Who is affected:** Marcus primarily. Also Priya (her team sends large files) and Alex (who occasionally needs to send something big).

**Current state:** The upload flow works for small files. For large files (1 GB+), the experience is uncertain -- does it work? Will it fail? Can I retry? The brief acknowledges this: chunked upload, retry logic, and checksum verification are needed.

**Recommended fix (design level):** The design agency should design the upload flow to accommodate large file states:
- Progress bar with percentage, bytes transferred, and estimated time remaining
- "Upload can be resumed if interrupted" messaging (when the feature is ready)
- "File integrity verified" confirmation after upload (when checksum is implemented)
- File size display before upload begins, with any applicable limits stated clearly

**Priority:** P2 for design (the agency should design for this from the start, even if the backend is not ready). P2 for implementation (per the brief).

---

#### Gap 4: Encryption as Friction

**The gap:** The encryption step in the upload flow adds a visible processing phase. For small files this is instant, but for large files it will be noticeable. Users who do not understand why encryption is happening may perceive this as unnecessary slowness.

**Who is affected:** Marcus (large files, noticeable encryption time), Alex (any visible delay is friction).

**Current state:** The upload flow shows an "Encrypting..." state. For users who understand encryption, this is a trust signal ("my file is being protected"). For users who do not, it is unexplained waiting.

**Recommended fix:** Reframe the encryption step as a benefit, not a cost:
- Instead of "Encrypting...", show "Protecting your file..." with a brief explanation: "Your file is being encrypted in your browser. The encrypted version is what gets uploaded -- we never see the original."
- For large files, show estimated encryption time alongside upload time.
- Consider combining the encryption and upload progress into a single progress indicator with two phases, so it feels like one step, not two.

**Priority:** P2. This is a design problem, not a technical problem. The design agency can address it in the upload flow mockups.

---

#### Gap 5: Recipient Experience Onboarding

**The gap:** When a recipient opens a download link, they encounter the product for the first time with zero context. They see a download page but no explanation of what happened (the file was encrypted, they are decrypting it, the sender chose this tool for privacy).

**Who is affected:** Every recipient. The recipient is the viral loop entry point -- if their experience is confusing, they will not become a sender.

**Current state:** The download page shows the file and a decryption mechanism. The "Want to send files too?" CTA appears (per the v0.2.33 review, it appears too early -- before download completes).

**Recommended fix:**
1. Add a brief context message on the download page: "This file was sent to you securely via SGraph Send. It was encrypted before upload and is being decrypted in your browser now."
2. Move the CTA to appear only after successful decryption (per Advocate recommendation A-11 from v0.2.33).
3. Include a one-sentence value proposition: "Want to send files this securely? It takes 30 seconds."

**Priority:** P2. The design agency should design the recipient experience as a first-class flow, not an afterthought.

---

#### Gap 6: Token Acquisition for New Users

**The gap:** The access gate requires a token. A user without a token sees the LaunchList signup form and has no way to try the product. The gap between "I am curious" and "I can use this" is too large.

**Who is affected:** Dani (the curious evaluator) most critically. Also Alex (if they arrive from a viral link expecting to send).

**Current state:** Token required. No demo mode. No preview. No way to experience the product without a token.

**Recommended fix for design agency consideration:**
- **Demo mode:** A pre-loaded example that shows the full upload-encrypt-share flow without requiring a token. "See how it works" button that runs a demonstration.
- **Trial token:** Automatic issuance of a limited-use token (e.g., 3 transfers) for anyone who visits. No signup required.
- **Recipient-to-sender flow:** If someone downloads a file via SGraph Send, they should receive a token automatically (or be offered one) so they can send their own files immediately.

**Priority:** P2 (the brief focuses on friendlies and token-based access for now, but this becomes P1 before any public launch).

## 7. Coordination with Other Roles

| Role | What the Advocate needs from them | What the Advocate provides to them |
|------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Designer** | Persona cards incorporated into design agency brief; accessibility requirements listed as design constraints from day one | The five personas (Section 1), accessibility matrix (Section 4), user journey gap analysis (Section 6) |
| **Ambassador** | The "Why not WeTransfer?" competitive framing (Section 2.4) validated for external use; one-line differentiator tested | Persona-level analysis of what users care about in the WeTransfer comparison (Section 2.2) |
| **Architect** | Large file transfer design that addresses Marcus's needs; unencrypted mode architecture that supports admin policy controls | User perspective on unencrypted mode (Section 3); large file confidence signals needed in the UI (Gap 3) |
| **AppSec** | Security review of the unencrypted mode proposal; confirmation that "Express Mode" framing does not create false security expectations | Advocate's recommendation to delay unencrypted mode until brand and encryption are established (Section 3.2) |
| **Sherpa** | Trail data structure that supports the feedback loop (Section 5); friction point tracking per persona | Persona definitions that the Sherpa can use to segment trail analysis |
| **Journalist** | Landing page copy that implements the three-level communication hierarchy (Section 2.3) | The communication hierarchy itself, tested against persona needs |
| **Conductor** | Prioritisation alignment on the gaps identified in Section 6 | This action plan as a prioritised backlog from the user perspective |

## 8. Open Questions for the Human

1. **Marcus vs. Sofia priority:** The brief identifies both large file transfer (Marcus) and security communication (Sofia) as important. Which persona should the design agency optimise for first? The Advocate's recommendation is to optimise for Dani (the landing page) first, because every other persona enters through Dani's journey. But the product experience should prioritise Marcus, because his pain point has the widest addressable market.

2. **Demo mode or trial token?** Gap 6 proposes two approaches to lowering the barrier for new users. A demo mode is lower friction but does not result in a real transfer. A trial token results in a real transfer but requires some form of issuance mechanism. Which approach aligns with the current friendlies strategy?

3. **Unencrypted mode naming:** The Advocate recommends "Express Mode" over "Unencrypted Mode." Does this framing align with the human's intent? Is there a better name that communicates speed without obscuring the security trade-off?

4. **Design agency feedback cadence:** How frequently will the human interact with the design agency? The Advocate wants to ensure the feedback loop (Section 5.1) is aligned with the actual communication cadence, not an idealised one.

---

## 9. Summary

The Advocate's action plan centres on one insight: **the product works, but it does not yet explain why it matters.**

The five personas (Sofia, Marcus, Priya, Alex, Dani) give the design agency a framework for every visual and interaction decision. The "Why not WeTransfer?" analysis provides the messaging hierarchy. The unencrypted mode recommendation is: not now, and when it ships, frame it as "Express Mode" with admin controls. The accessibility requirements are non-negotiable constraints the agency must design within from day one. The feedback loop turns the design agency itself into a continuous source of user insight.

The six user journey gaps are ranked by impact. The single highest-priority gap is the landing page: the product must explain itself within 10 seconds. Everything else -- differentiation, large file confidence, encryption reframing, recipient onboarding, token barriers -- flows from that first moment of understanding.

If a user understands what SGraph Send does and why it is different within 10 seconds, every other problem becomes solvable. If they do not, no amount of technical excellence will save the product.

**Previous recommendation status (from v0.2.33):**
