**Version:** v0.2.33
**Date:** 13 February 2026
**Role:** Advocate (first activation)
**Session:** `claude/read-secure-send-brief-Mz6yN`
**Scope:** User trust assessment across v0.1.1-v0.1.3, LinkedIn post impact, accessibility review, persona mapping

## 1. User Trust Assessment

### 1.1 Cumulative Trust Impact: v0.1.1 through v0.1.3

This session shipped three UI versions. Taken individually, each is a feature release. Taken together, they form a trust narrative: we are systematically removing reasons for users to distrust us.

| Version | Feature | Trust Signal Sent to User |
|---------|---------|---------------------------|
| **v0.1.1** | Hash-fragment URLs | "We designed the system so the server never sees your key." The single combined link (`download.html#{id}/{key}`) is more than a UX improvement. The hash fragment is architecturally invisible to the server -- browsers do not send hash fragments in HTTP requests. This is not a policy choice; it is a protocol-level guarantee. Users who understand URLs will recognise this. Users who do not will still benefit from the simpler single-link flow. |
| **v0.1.1** | Google Analytics removed | "We removed the thing that was watching you." This is the strongest trust action of the session. Not because GA was dangerous (it was not exfiltrating keys), but because its presence contradicted our core promise. A zero-knowledge platform running third-party analytics creates cognitive dissonance. Removing it eliminates that dissonance. The absence of a cookie banner is now a feature, not an oversight. |
| **v0.1.2** | Text input mode | "We did not make you work around our limitations." Before text mode, a user who wanted to send a password or a note had to create a text file, save it, then upload it. That friction communicated: "this tool was not built for you." Text mode communicates the opposite: "we anticipated your need." This builds trust through competence, not through security claims. |
| **v0.1.3** | Internationalisation (4 languages) | "We see you." For a Portuguese-speaking user, encountering their language -- in the correct regional variant (Brasil vs Portugal) -- communicates respect. It says: this product was not built exclusively for English speakers and then grudgingly localised. The distinction between "arquivo" (Brasil) and "ficheiro" (Portugal), between "criptografar" and "encriptar", is the kind of detail that builds trust through cultural literacy. |

### 1.2 The Zero-Cookie Decision

The decision to maintain a zero-cookie policy (D025) is the single most powerful trust signal this product possesses.

**Why it matters for each persona:**

**Privacy-first professional:** This persona checks. They open DevTools, they inspect the Application tab, they look at network requests. A zero-cookie policy is not just a claim for this user -- it is a verifiable property. They can confirm it in under 10 seconds. Once confirmed, the trust transfer is complete: "If these people are honest about cookies, they are probably honest about encryption." The zero-cookie claim functions as a trust anchor that validates all other claims.

**Casual sender:** This persona may never check DevTools. But they will notice the absence of the cookie consent banner. Every other website on the internet demands a decision about cookies before you can do anything. SGraph Send lets you start immediately. For this persona, the trust signal is experienced as convenience: "This site respects my time." The absence of friction IS the trust.

**Technical evaluator / developer:** This persona will verify aggressively. They will check cookies, localStorage, network requests, CSP headers, referrer policy. The zero-cookie claim invites this scrutiny, and the product survives it. For this persona, verifiability is the feature. "Check it yourself" is more persuasive than any privacy policy.

**Klingon enthusiast / community member:** This is a new emergent persona (see Section 4). The zero-cookie claim matters less to them initially, but the Klingon translation communicates something equally important: "This team does not take itself so seriously that it cannot have fun, but it takes its engineering seriously enough to support a constructed language with a non-Latin script system."

### 1.3 Risks to Trust

Trust is asymmetric: it accumulates slowly and collapses instantly. The following risks deserve monitoring.

| Risk | Severity | Trigger | Impact |
|------|----------|---------|--------|
| **localStorage contradicts zero-cookie narrative** | MEDIUM | The i18n module stores `sgraph-send-locale` in localStorage (i18n.js, line 193). The download component stores history in localStorage (send-download.js, line 392). If a user checks localStorage after we claim "zero tracking", they will find data. The claim "zero cookies" is technically accurate, but the spirit of the claim ("we store nothing") is contradicted. | User feels misled. The AppSec review (v0.2.33) correctly identifies this and recommends opt-in with a transparency panel. The Advocate endorses this but adds: **the default state must be truly empty.** The locale preference is currently stored without consent. This should either use a session-only mechanism or be explicitly disclosed. |
| **Version path in URLs undermines professionalism** | MEDIUM | The Sherpa identifies this as F006. Download links contain `/v0/v0.1/v0.1.3/download.html`, which communicates "beta software" to recipients who receive the link. | A recipient's first encounter with SGraph Send is through this URL. If it looks like a development environment, trust starts at a deficit. URL rewriting should be prioritised. |
| **Generic download filename** | HIGH | The Sherpa identifies this as F005. Files download as "download" with no extension. | This is the trust risk with the highest frequency. Every file recipient encounters it. It communicates: "this tool does not care about your workflow." The SGMETA envelope (shipped in v0.1.3) addresses this for the sender-side -- filenames are now embedded in the encrypted payload. But the download component appears to only use the extracted filename conditionally (send-download.js, lines 323-326), and the fallback is still "download". This needs verification that the SGMETA extraction is working end-to-end. |
| **Test files on production page** | LOW | The Sherpa identifies this as F013. A "Test Files" section on the upload page signals "this is not a real product." | For the friendlies programme this is acceptable. Before any public launch beyond friendlies, this section must either be removed or reframed. |
| **Third-party script: LaunchList** | MEDIUM | Both index.html (line 31) and download.html (line 32) load `https://getlaunchlist.com/js/widget-diy.js`. After removing Google Analytics on the grounds that third-party JavaScript is incompatible with a zero-knowledge platform, we immediately load a different third-party script for email collection. | This is not as severe as GA (LaunchList is a simple form handler, not an analytics platform), but the principle is the same: third-party JavaScript executes with full same-origin privileges. If the team's position is "no third-party JS", then LaunchList must be replaced with a self-hosted form handler. If the position is "no third-party tracking JS", then LaunchList is acceptable but should be documented and AppSec-reviewed. The Advocate recommends addressing this before publicly marketing the "no third-party scripts" claim. |

## 2. LinkedIn Post -- User Perspective

### 2.1 The Post

The LinkedIn post (https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7428147910451638272/) features the i18n capability with screenshots showing the product in all 4 languages. The hook is the Klingon translation.

### 2.2 Trust Signals the Post Sends

**Positive signals:**

1. **Real product, real screenshots.** The post shows actual UI, not mockups or wireframes. This communicates: the product exists and works. For LinkedIn's audience (professionals, developers, evaluators), this is more persuasive than a landing page promise.

2. **The Klingon angle demonstrates technical capability without requiring the viewer to understand the technology.** A viewer does not need to know what AES-256-GCM is to understand that supporting Klingon as a language requires real i18n architecture. The joke carries the proof.

3. **Portuguese variants (Brasil + Portugal) signal cultural awareness.** For Portuguese-speaking professionals in Dinis's network, seeing the distinction between PT-BR and PT-PT communicates: "This person understands that language is not just translation, it is localisation." This is a powerful trust signal for international enterprise use cases.

4. **The conversational tone ("Anybody here speaks Klingon?") humanises the product.** Privacy tools often suffer from an approachability problem -- they feel intimidating or paranoid. The Klingon angle positions SGraph Send as serious technology with a human team behind it.

**Caution signals:**

1. **The post does not mention privacy or security.** The i18n capability is the hook, but it is not the product's value proposition. A viewer who clicks through expecting a multilingual tool will arrive at a product whose core promise is zero-knowledge encryption. There is a gap between what the post sells and what the product delivers. This is not necessarily a problem -- curiosity-driven traffic is valuable -- but the landing experience must bridge this gap.

2. **No explanation of what SGraph Send actually does.** The post assumes the viewer already knows. For Dinis's network, many will. For viral reach beyond that network, the post needs a one-sentence description of the product.

### 2.3 Handling LinkedIn Traffic

LinkedIn traffic arriving at the product faces the same friction the Sherpa identified in F001: **the product does not explain itself.** The subtitle "Zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing" is jargon. A LinkedIn visitor who clicked because of Klingon will not understand what they are looking at.

**Recommended first-impression sequence for LinkedIn traffic:**

1. **The product should explain itself within 5 seconds.** The Journalist has drafted landing page copy ("Send files. Simply. Securely." from the v0.2.24 response). This content should be the first priority for the next UI version. A LinkedIn visitor needs to see: (a) what this does, (b) why they should care, (c) how to start.

2. **The language selector should be visible and functional.** If the Klingon angle is what brought them, they should be able to switch to Klingon immediately. The current locale selector is positioned in the top-right corner (absolute positioned, `top: 1rem; right: 1rem`). On mobile devices, which represent a significant share of LinkedIn browsing, this may be small or poorly positioned. The Advocate recommends testing the locale selector at common mobile viewport widths.

3. **The access gate is a conversion barrier.** LinkedIn traffic will encounter the access gate before seeing the product. Users without a token see "Beta Access" with a token input field. There is no "request access" flow -- just a LaunchList signup that says "Join the Early Access Program." The gap between "I am curious" and "I can try this" is too large. Consider providing a demo mode, a pre-loaded example, or a read-only preview of the upload flow for unauthenticated visitors.

4. **The download page CTA is correctly positioned for LinkedIn-driven viral loops.** When a recipient opens a shared file, they see "Want to send files too?" with a signup form. This is the viral conversion point. However, as the Sherpa notes (F008), the CTA appears immediately before the download completes. It should appear only after successful decryption, when the user has experienced the value.

### 2.4 First Impression Assessment

A LinkedIn visitor clicking through today will experience:

1. Land on upload page -- see "SGraph Send" and "Zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing"
2. Encounter the access gate -- see "Beta Access" and a token input
3. If they have no token: see the LaunchList signup form and leave

The drop-off point is step 2. The visitor has no context, no demonstration of value, and no way to try the product. The Advocate rates the current first impression as **insufficient for LinkedIn-sourced traffic** and recommends that explanatory content (Journalist's drafted copy) and a demo/preview mode be prioritised before any further public promotion.

## 3. Accessibility and Inclusion Review

### 3.1 What the i18n Implementation Gets Right

The i18n architecture (i18n.js) is well-designed for extensibility:

- **Async locale loading** -- languages load on demand via fetch, keeping the initial bundle small.
- **Event-driven re-rendering** -- the `locale-changed` custom event triggers component updates. This is the correct pattern for Web Components.
- **Fallback to English** -- if a translation key is missing, the English string is used. This prevents broken UIs.
- **`document.documentElement.lang` is updated** on locale change (index.html, line 42). This is essential for screen readers and browser-level language detection.
- **localStorage persistence** -- the selected locale is remembered across sessions. This is good UX (users should not have to re-select their language on every visit).

### 3.2 Accessibility Gaps

| Gap | Severity | Details | Recommendation |
|-----|----------|---------|----------------|
| **No `lang` attribute on translated content within mixed-language pages** | HIGH | When the page language is set to `en` but the user switches to `pt`, the `<html lang>` attribute is updated globally. This is correct. However, if any component renders English fallback strings (because a key is missing from the Portuguese translation), the screen reader will attempt to pronounce English words with Portuguese phonetics. | For mixed-language scenarios, wrap fallback strings in `<span lang="en">`. This is a WCAG 2.1 Level A requirement (Success Criterion 3.1.2: Language of Parts). |
| **Locale selector buttons lack accessible names** | MEDIUM | The locale selector renders buttons with emoji flags and language names (e.g., the British flag emoji followed by "English"). Emoji flags may not be read correctly by all screen readers. Some screen readers will read the Unicode code points or skip them entirely. | Add `aria-label` attributes to locale buttons: `aria-label="Switch to English"`, `aria-label="Mudar para Portugues (Brasil)"`, etc. The label should be in the TARGET language, not the current one, so the user who needs Portuguese can identify it. |
| **No `aria-live` regions for dynamic state changes** | HIGH | When the upload state changes (idle -> encrypting -> uploading -> complete), the entire component re-renders via `innerHTML`. Screen readers will not announce these transitions. A blind user who clicks "Encrypt & Upload" will receive no feedback until they manually navigate the DOM. | Add `aria-live="polite"` regions for progress and status updates. The progress text ("Encrypting...", "Uploading...") should be in a live region. The success/error messages should be in an `aria-live="assertive"` region. |
| **Drop zone is not keyboard-accessible** | HIGH | The drop zone relies on click and drag events. The file input is `display: none` (send-upload.js, line 87). While clicking the drop zone triggers the hidden file input, this interaction is not discoverable via keyboard navigation. The drop zone has no `tabindex`, no `role`, and no keyboard event handlers. | Add `tabindex="0"`, `role="button"`, `aria-label` to the drop zone. Add `keydown` handler for Enter and Space to trigger the file input. This is a WCAG 2.1 Level A requirement (Success Criterion 2.1.1: Keyboard). |
| **Progress bar lacks ARIA attributes** | MEDIUM | The progress bar is a styled `<div>` with no semantic meaning. Screen readers cannot determine that it represents progress or what percentage it is at. | Use `role="progressbar"`, `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin="0"`, `aria-valuemax="100"`, and `aria-label="Upload progress"`. |
| **Colour contrast in status messages** | MEDIUM | The success status uses `color: #059669` on `background: #ecfdf5`. The info status uses `color: #1e40af` on `background: #eff6ff`. These combinations should be verified against WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text). The success text in particular (#059669 on #ecfdf5) may be borderline. | Run a contrast checker on all status colour combinations. Adjust if any fail the 4.5:1 ratio. |
| **No focus management after state transitions** | MEDIUM | When the upload completes and the result panel appears, keyboard focus remains wherever it was (likely on the now-removed upload button). The user must Tab through the entire page to find the new content. | After state transitions, programmatically move focus to the new content. After upload completion, focus the "Share this link" section. After download completion, focus the success message or the decrypted text. |

### 3.3 RTL Language Support Readiness

The current i18n implementation is **not ready for RTL languages** (Arabic, Hebrew, Farsi, Urdu).

| Issue | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **No `dir` attribute handling** | When a RTL locale is selected, the `<html dir="rtl">` attribute must be set. The i18n module does not do this. |
| **CSS uses directional properties** | The CSS uses `margin-left`, `margin-right`, `text-align: left`, `text-align: right`, `flex-direction: row` -- all of which assume LTR. CSS logical properties (`margin-inline-start`, `margin-inline-end`, `text-align: start`, `text-align: end`) should be used instead. |
| **Locale selector positioning** | The locale selector is positioned with `right: 1rem`. In RTL mode, this should be `left: 1rem`. Using logical properties (`inset-inline-end: 1rem`) solves this automatically. |
| **Inline styles in components** | The Web Components use numerous inline styles with directional values (e.g., `margin-left: 0.25rem` in send-upload.js, line 176). Each of these would need to be converted for RTL support. |
| **The i18n module has no locale metadata** | The `availableLocales` array stores `code`, `name`, and `flag`, but not `dir` (text direction). Adding a `dir` field would allow the i18n module to set `document.documentElement.dir` on locale change. |

**Assessment:** Supporting RTL languages requires a CSS refactoring pass (directional to logical properties) and a small addition to the i18n module. This is not a large effort, but it should be planned before adding Arabic or Hebrew locales. The Advocate recommends adding `dir` metadata to the locale definitions now (even if RTL locales are not yet available) so the architecture is ready.

### 3.4 Screen Reader Compatibility of i18n Implementation

The `data-i18n` attribute pattern used for static HTML elements (index.html, lines 43-46) is screen-reader compatible -- it replaces `textContent`, which is the correct approach. Screen readers will read the translated text naturally.

However, the Web Components render their translated content via `innerHTML` replacement. This means:

1. Screen readers will read the content correctly when the page first loads.
2. When the locale changes, the entire component DOM is destroyed and rebuilt. Screen readers will lose their position in the document and may not announce the new content.
3. The `locale-changed` event handler in both components only re-renders if the state is `idle` or `complete` (send-upload.js, line 30) or `ready` or `complete` (send-download.js, line 33). This is correct -- you should not re-render during active operations -- but it means a screen reader user who changes language mid-flow will not see the change until the operation completes.

**Recommendation:** After a locale change triggers a re-render, announce the change to screen readers via an `aria-live` region: "Language changed to Portugues (Brasil)." This confirms the action for users who cannot see the visual change.

## 4. User Persona Impact

### 4.1 Existing Personas (from v0.2.16 brief)

The persona brief defines four starting personas. Here is how this session's work maps to each.

#### The Security-Conscious Professional

**Persona summary:** Needs to share sensitive documents with clients. Worried about email interception. Checks privacy claims.

**v0.1.1 impact (hash-fragment URLs):** STRONG. The single-link sharing flow directly addresses this persona's workflow: send a link via one channel, recipient clicks, file is decrypted. The hash-fragment architecture gives this persona a verifiable reason to trust the mechanism -- they can confirm the key never appears in server logs.

**v0.1.1 impact (GA removal):** STRONG. This persona would have noticed GA (they check network requests). Its removal eliminates a trust contradiction that could have been a deal-breaker.

**v0.1.2 impact (text mode):** MODERATE. This persona may use text mode for sharing passwords, API keys, or short confidential messages. The same encryption pipeline applies, which is reassuring.

**v0.1.3 impact (i18n):** MODERATE. If this persona operates in a multilingual environment (e.g., a Portuguese-speaking CISO at a Brazilian company), the localisation is directly relevant. For English-only users, it signals product maturity.

**Zero-cookie impact:** STRONG. This persona verifies claims. The zero-cookie posture passes verification.

#### The Compliance Officer

**Persona summary:** Needs provable zero-knowledge sharing for regulatory requirements. Cares about audit trails.

**v0.1.1 impact:** STRONG. Hash-fragment URLs provide an architectural argument for compliance: "The decryption key is never transmitted to the server. This is a property of the URL design, not just a policy."

**v0.1.1 impact (GA removal):** CRITICAL. A compliance officer evaluating the product would flag GA as a third-party data processor requiring DPIA. Removing it eliminates a compliance blocker.

**v0.1.2 impact:** LOW. Text mode is a convenience feature that does not significantly affect compliance posture.

**v0.1.3 impact:** MODERATE. For international compliance (LGPD in Brazil, CNPD in Portugal), having the product available in Portuguese demonstrates readiness for those markets.

**Zero-cookie impact:** CRITICAL. Zero cookies means: no PECR consent requirement, no GDPR cookie consent, no cookie audit trail, no third-party processor documentation. The compliance burden drops dramatically.

#### The Freelancer / Consultant

**Persona summary:** Shares deliverables with multiple clients. Wants something simple and professional.

**v0.1.1 impact (hash-fragment URLs):** STRONG. The single-link flow is the key improvement for this persona. They do not want to explain to clients how to combine a link and a key. One link, one click, done.

**v0.1.1 impact (GA removal):** LOW. This persona is unlikely to check for analytics scripts. They will notice the absence of a cookie banner as a minor convenience.

**v0.1.2 impact:** MODERATE. Text mode enables quick sharing of project updates, credentials, or notes without creating files.

**v0.1.3 impact:** STRONG for multilingual freelancers. A Portuguese freelancer serving international clients can now show the product in their language and switch to English when sharing with English-speaking clients. The locale persistence (remembered across sessions) reduces friction.

**Zero-cookie impact:** LOW directly, but HIGH indirectly. The freelancer's clients will not see a cookie banner, which means one less question to answer: "Is it safe to use this?"

#### The Technical User / Developer

**Persona summary:** Wants API access, CLI tools, programmatic file sharing.

**v0.1.1 impact:** MODERATE. Hash-fragment URLs are interesting to this persona from an architectural perspective. They may appreciate the design but are waiting for API/CLI access.

**v0.1.2 impact:** MODERATE. Text mode enables programmatic-adjacent use cases (sharing config snippets, env files).

**v0.1.3 impact:** LOW directly (developers are typically English-comfortable), but HIGH for evaluation purposes. A developer evaluating the product for their organisation will note that i18n is built in, which signals the product can be deployed internationally.

**Zero-cookie impact:** STRONG. This persona will verify. The zero-cookie claim, combined with the absence of any third-party scripts (post-GA removal), gives them confidence to recommend the product to their organisation.

### 4.2 Emergent Persona: The Community Member

The LinkedIn post introduces a new persona type that the original brief did not anticipate.

**Profile:** A member of Dinis's LinkedIn network. May be a tech professional, security practitioner, or general technology enthusiast. Arrives at SGraph Send because they saw an interesting post, not because they have a file-sharing need.

**Behaviour:** Curiosity-driven. Will click through to look, evaluate quickly, and leave if not immediately engaged. May not have a token. May share the post or the product link with their network if they find it interesting.

**Need from the product:** A clear, immediate answer to: "What is this, and should I care?" The product currently does not provide this answer within the first 5 seconds.

**Impact of this session's work:** The i18n and Klingon angle creates the curiosity. The product must convert that curiosity into understanding. This persona is the one most underserved by the current UI.

**Recommendation:** Define this persona formally. Name them. Give them a scenario. The friendlies programme will generate many people who arrive through word-of-mouth rather than need. The product's onboarding experience should serve them.

### 4.3 Persona Benefit Matrix

| Feature Shipped | Security Pro | Compliance Officer | Freelancer | Developer | Community Member |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Hash-fragment URLs | +++  | +++ | +++ | ++ | + |
| GA removal | +++ | ++++ | + | +++ | + |
| Text mode | ++ | + | ++ | ++ | + |
| i18n (4 languages) | ++ | ++ | +++ | + | +++ |
| Zero-cookie policy | +++ | ++++ | + | +++ | + |
| Auto-decrypt | ++ | + | +++ | ++ | ++ |
| SGMETA metadata | + | + | +++ | ++ | + |

Legend: + minor benefit, ++ moderate benefit, +++ strong benefit, ++++ critical benefit

## 5. Advocate Recommendations

### Priority 1 -- Address Before Next Public Promotion

| # | Recommendation | Rationale |
|---|---------------|-----------|
| A-01 | **Add explanatory landing page content.** The Journalist has drafted copy. It should be the first feature of v0.1.4. | Every persona except the Security Pro struggles with the current "what is this?" gap (Sherpa F001). LinkedIn traffic amplifies this problem. |
| A-02 | **Disclose or eliminate default localStorage writes.** The i18n module writes `sgraph-send-locale` without user consent. Either make this opt-in or document it in the transparency panel. | The zero-cookie narrative creates an expectation of zero local storage. Any undisclosed storage, however benign, undermines trust. |
| A-03 | **Address the LaunchList third-party script.** Either self-host the form handler or explicitly document why this external script is acceptable after removing GA for the same reason. | Consistency of principle matters. Users and evaluators will notice the contradiction. |

### Priority 2 -- Address Before Wider Rollout

| # | Recommendation | Rationale |
|---|---------------|-----------|
| A-04 | **Implement keyboard accessibility for the drop zone.** Add `tabindex`, `role`, keyboard handlers. | WCAG 2.1 Level A. Required for basic accessibility compliance. |
| A-05 | **Add `aria-live` regions for state transitions.** Upload progress, success/error messages must be announced to screen readers. | WCAG 2.1 Level A. Without this, the product is unusable for blind users. |
| A-06 | **Verify SGMETA filename extraction works end-to-end** on the download side, ensuring recipients get meaningful filenames. | Sherpa F005 is the highest-frequency trust friction. |
| A-07 | **Implement URL rewriting** so download links are clean (`/d/{id}` instead of `/send/v0/v0.1/v0.1.3/download.html`). | Sherpa F006. Clean URLs build trust. Versioned paths signal beta. |
| A-08 | **Add `dir` metadata to i18n locale definitions** and prepare CSS for logical properties. | RTL readiness is an architecture decision, not a feature. Making the decision now prevents a refactoring crisis when Arabic or Hebrew support is requested. |

### Priority 3 -- Address Before Public Launch

| # | Recommendation | Rationale |
|---|---------------|-----------|
| A-09 | **Complete i18n coverage.** The transparency panel (v0.1.0) and access gate (v0.1.0) still use hardcoded English strings. | Sherpa F011 and F012. A user who selects Portuguese should not encounter English in the transparency panel. |
| A-10 | **Rewrite error messages to include recovery guidance.** | Sherpa F009. Error messages should follow: "[What happened]. [Why]. [What to do next]." |
| A-11 | **Move the CTA on the download page to appear after successful decryption only.** | Sherpa F008. Show the signup prompt when the user has experienced the value, not before. |
| A-12 | **Define the Community Member persona formally.** | The LinkedIn post created a new user type. The product should be ready for them. |

## 6. Summary

This session was excellent for user trust. The three shipped versions form a coherent trust narrative: simpler sharing (v0.1.1), broader capability (v0.1.2), cultural awareness (v0.1.3), and a bold privacy stance (GA removal + zero cookies). The Klingon angle on LinkedIn is a memorable entry point that will drive curiosity traffic.

The primary risk is that the product does not yet explain itself. A user who arrives -- from LinkedIn or any other channel -- encounters a product that works well but does not say what it does or why it matters. The Journalist's drafted landing page copy should be the top priority for the next UI version.

The secondary risk is an emerging gap between the privacy narrative ("zero cookies, zero tracking") and the actual client-side storage behaviour (localStorage writes for locale preference and download history). This gap is small and benign, but it must be addressed before the narrative is made public. Trust is built on precision, not approximation.

The accessibility gaps are significant. The product is currently unusable for keyboard-only and screen reader users. This is acceptable for a closed beta with known friendlies, but it must be addressed before any public rollout. The i18n architecture is well-designed for adding RTL support in the future, but CSS changes are needed before that can happen.

The Advocate's verdict: **the product is earning trust faster than it is explaining itself.** The next sprint should close that gap.
