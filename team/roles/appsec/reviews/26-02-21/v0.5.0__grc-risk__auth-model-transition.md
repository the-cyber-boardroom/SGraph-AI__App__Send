# v0.5.0 -- GRC Risk Capture: Authentication Model Transition

**Version:** v0.5.0
**Date:** 21 February 2026
**Role:** GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance) with AppSec input
**Team:** Explorer
**Classification:** Internal -- Risk Register
**Risk ID:** GRC-RISK-001 -- Auth Model Transition
**Source:** Project Owner (Dinis Cruz) -- risk identified during v0.5.0 AppSec review of PKI architecture
**Related AppSec review:** [v0.5.0 PKI Architecture Security Review](v0.5.0__review__pki-architecture-security.md)
**Vulnerability framework:** [v0.4.9 GRC Vulnerability Classification Framework](../../../grc/reviews/26-02-17/v0.4.9__vulnerability-classification-framework.md)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The v0.5.0 AppSec review of the PKI architecture identified 21 findings (KD-1 through KD-8, CT-1 through CT-8, SP-1 through SP-5) across three proposed subsystems: Key Discovery, Chain of Trust, and Secure Pod. Many of these findings were assessed at Critical or High severity in a general threat model but were deprioritised or noted as lower urgency because of the platform's **current operating context**: a high-trust, admin-controlled, pre-customer MVP.

This document captures a specific, forward-looking risk: **the transition from the current high-trust authentication model to a wider-access model will silently reactivate every deprioritised finding.** If that transition happens without a coordinated security review, endpoints and subsystems that were safe under admin-only access will become exposed to a broader, less-trusted audience without the security controls those findings recommended.

The GRC team's responsibility is to track this transition as a gated risk item and ensure that no widening of the auth model proceeds without first addressing the full catalogue of deprioritised AppSec findings.

---

## 2. Risk Description

### 2.1 What Is the Risk

**Risk statement:** When SG/Send transitions from an admin-controlled, high-trust authentication model to a broader access model (self-registration, multi-tenant, guest users, OAuth/OIDC federation), security findings that were deprioritised due to the current trust model will become genuinely exploitable. If the transition occurs without re-evaluating and addressing these findings, the platform will expose endpoints and subsystems to a wider, less-trusted audience without adequate security controls.

**Risk category:** Authentication / Access Control Transition
**Risk type:** Conditional -- dormant until triggered by a business decision

### 2.2 Why This Is a GRC Item (Not Just AppSec)

This is a governance risk, not just a technical one:

1. **The deprioritisation was a deliberate, documented decision** -- findings were downgraded because the current context makes them low-impact. This is correct risk management.
2. **The context will change** -- the business will grow, the auth model will widen. This is expected.
3. **The danger is the gap between the decision to widen and the re-evaluation of security findings.** In a fast-moving project, the auth model could widen incrementally (one endpoint made public, then another) without anyone recognising that the aggregate effect crosses the threshold where deprioritised findings become critical.
4. **GRC owns the trigger.** AppSec identifies findings and recommends controls. GRC tracks whether the conditions under which risks were accepted still hold. When conditions change, GRC triggers re-evaluation.

## 3. Current State

### 3.1 Current Authentication Model

| Property | Current State |
|----------|--------------|
| User base | Controlled -- all users known to admin, issued tokens manually |
| Authentication method | Admin-issued access tokens (API key model) |
| Anonymous access | None -- all operations require a valid token |
| Self-registration | Not available |
| Multi-tenancy | Single tenant (SGraph) |
| Trust levels | Binary: admin or authenticated user (both high-trust) |
| Customer status | No active customers -- MVP/Explorer stage |
| Admin Lambda | Provides authentication for all management endpoints |
| User Lambda | Requires access tokens for all protected operations |
| Identity provider | None -- no OAuth, no Cognito, no OIDC federation |

### 3.2 Why the Current Model Is High-Trust

In the current model:

- **Every user is known.** The admin manually creates tokens and issues them to specific people. There are no anonymous or unknown users.
- **The admin controls the namespace.** There is no risk of key squatting because the admin is the only entity that can publish keys.
- **Rate limiting is implicit.** With a handful of known users, natural usage patterns are far below any abuse threshold.
- **CORS and origin restrictions are less critical.** All API calls come from authenticated sessions initiated by known users. Cross-origin attacks require tricking a known user.
- **Enumeration is not a threat.** The admin already knows all keys and all users. A membership oracle reveals nothing the admin doesn't already know.
- **Trust propagation is not a concern.** There are no trust groups, so group admin compromise has no blast radius.
- **Identity provider compromise is not relevant.** There is no identity provider to compromise.

### 3.3 What the AppSec Review Found

The [v0.5.0 PKI Architecture Security Review](v0.5.0__review__pki-architecture-security.md) identified 21 findings across three subsystems. The following were assessed at Critical or High severity but were noted as having reduced urgency in the current high-trust context:

**Critical findings (4):**

| ID | Finding | Why deprioritised in current context |
|----|---------|--------------------------------------|
| KD-1 | POST /api/keys has no authentication | Admin controls all key publication; no anonymous users exist |
| CT-1 | Equivocation attack on hash chain | Single-server architecture accepted for MVP; no adversarial clients |
| CT-2 | Group admin compromise propagates trust | No trust groups exist; no group admins |
| SP-2 | Pod+server compromise = total content exposure | Secure Pod is future architecture; not yet built |

**High findings (7):**

| ID | Finding | Why deprioritised in current context |
|----|---------|--------------------------------------|
| KD-2 | DELETE /api/keys authentication not specified | Admin-only operation; no multi-user key ownership |
| KD-5 | No rate limiting on any endpoint | Known users, low traffic, Lambda concurrency provides natural throttle |
| CT-3 | Challenge-response replay / nonce management | Challenge-response not yet implemented |
| CT-4 | OAuth/Cognito compromise enables key takeover | No OAuth/Cognito integrated |
| CT-7 | PKI-encrypted web delivery TOFU bootstrap | PKI-encrypted delivery is Phase 3; not yet built |
| SP-1 | Pod as single point of failure | Secure Pod is future architecture |
| SP-2 | Pod compromise blast radius (caveats) | Secure Pod is future architecture |

**Medium findings (9):**

| ID | Finding | Why deprioritised in current context |
|----|---------|--------------------------------------|
| KD-3 | Lookup code enumeration | Admin-only access; no public-facing lookup |
| KD-4 | Registry list exposes membership | Admin already knows all members |
| KD-6 | CORS/origin restrictions not specified | API key auth in headers mitigates CSRF; admin-only access |
| KD-7 | Transparency log not client-verifiable | Log is audit trail; no adversarial clients to equivocate against |
| CT-6 | Trust graph revocation cache staleness | No trust graphs exist yet |
| CT-8 | Hash chain signing authority confusion | Hash chain not yet implemented |
| SP-3 | Micro-payment budget self-enforcement | Secure Pod is future architecture |
| SP-4 | Client-side pod trust model mismatch | Secure Pod is future architecture |
| SP-5 | Pod unavailability degraded mode | Secure Pod is future architecture |

**Low findings (1 relevant):**

| ID | Finding | Why deprioritised in current context |
|----|---------|--------------------------------------|
| KD-8 | Hybrid lookup code metadata | Opaque code; acceptable as designed regardless of auth model |

---

## 4. Future State -- The Transition

### 4.1 What Will Change

When the platform grows, the authentication model will need to widen to support:

| Dimension | Current | Future |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| User base | Handful of known users | Broad set of users, not all directly known to admin |
| Registration | Admin-issued tokens only | Self-registration (email, OAuth, Cognito) |
| Multi-tenancy | Single tenant | Multiple organisations/tenants |
| Trust levels | Binary (admin / authenticated) | Multiple tiers: admin, organisation admin, regular user, guest |
| Identity provider | None | OAuth/OIDC (Google, Microsoft, GitHub), Cognito, SAML |
| Anonymous access | None | Possible for some operations (public key lookup, file download) |
| Traffic volume | Negligible | Production-level (rate limiting becomes essential) |
| Adversarial users | Not expected (all known) | Expected (open registration invites abuse) |

### 4.2 What Becomes Critical After Transition

When the auth model widens, the following deprioritised findings become genuinely critical:

**1. POST /api/keys (KD-1) -- currently admin-only, may need to be user-accessible**

- If any authenticated user can publish keys, key squatting and registry pollution become real attack vectors.
- Authentication on this endpoint goes from "nice to have" to "mandatory before deployment."
- Proof-of-possession (client signs a challenge with the corresponding private key) becomes essential to prevent publication of arbitrary keys.

**2. Challenge-response for key ownership (CT-3) -- not needed while admin controls all keys**

- Once users publish their own keys, proving ownership of the corresponding private key is the only way to prevent impersonation.
- Nonce management (128-bit, single-use, time-bounded, context-bound) becomes a hard requirement.
- Replay attacks become a realistic threat vector.

**3. Group admin compromise propagation (CT-2) -- not relevant until trust groups exist**

- When organisations create trust groups, a compromised admin key can add attacker-controlled keys to the group.
- Threshold signing (K-of-N admins) and member addition notifications become essential controls.
- Blast radius of a single compromised admin key is the entire organisation.

**4. Identity provider compromise (CT-4) -- not relevant until OAuth/Cognito is integrated**

- When keys are bound to OAuth/Cognito identities, IdP compromise enables key takeover for any user.
- Key rotation notification, cooldown periods, and multi-factor key binding become essential.
- Recovery procedures for IdP compromise must exist before integration.

**5. Rate limiting (KD-5) -- low priority while admin-only, critical with wider access**

- With open registration, all endpoints are exposed to automated abuse.
- The rate limits recommended in the AppSec review become minimum baselines, not aspirational targets.
- Without rate limiting: registry flooding (KD-1), enumeration attacks (KD-3), bandwidth DoS (KD-4), mass deletion (KD-2).

**6. Registry enumeration (KD-4) -- admin-only now, could become a membership oracle**

- `GET /api/keys` (list all) reveals the full set of users on the platform.
- On private deployments (investor data rooms, corporate environments), this is a membership oracle.
- Authentication on the list endpoint goes from optional to mandatory.

**7. CORS restrictions (KD-6) -- less critical behind admin auth, critical with public endpoints**

- If endpoints accept cross-origin requests and auth is cookie-based (OAuth sessions), CSRF attacks on key publication and deletion become viable.
- Origin validation and CSRF tokens become necessary for all state-changing operations.
- The current mitigation (API key in headers is not automatically sent by browsers) will not apply after OAuth migration.

## 5. Trigger Conditions

### 5.1 Primary Triggers

The GRC team MUST initiate a full AppSec re-review when ANY of the following conditions are met:

| Trigger ID | Condition | Severity |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| **T-1** | **Self-registration is enabled** for any user class (email signup, OAuth, invitation links) | Critical -- this is the primary trigger |
| **T-2** | **OAuth/OIDC/Cognito is integrated** as an identity provider | Critical -- activates CT-4 (IdP compromise) |
| **T-3** | **POST /api/keys is accessible** to non-admin users | Critical -- activates KD-1, KD-2, KD-3, KD-5 |
| **T-4** | **Trust groups are implemented** with multi-user membership | Critical -- activates CT-2 (group admin compromise) |
| **T-5** | **Any endpoint is made accessible without authentication** (anonymous access) | High -- requires rate limiting, CORS, enumeration protections |

### 5.2 Secondary Triggers

The GRC team SHOULD review the risk register when any of the following occur:

| Trigger ID | Condition | Severity |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| **T-6** | **First paying customer** signs up | High -- risk acceptance rationale changes when real customers exist |
| **T-7** | **Multi-tenancy is implemented** (separate organisations sharing infrastructure) | High -- activates tenant isolation concerns |
| **T-8** | **Traffic exceeds 1,000 requests/day** sustained | Medium -- natural rate limiting assumptions no longer hold |
| **T-9** | **The Secure Pod is implemented** | High -- activates SP-1 through SP-5 |
| **T-10** | **The hash chain/trust graph is implemented** | High -- activates CT-1, CT-6, CT-8 |

### 5.3 Trigger Detection

How will the GRC team know when a trigger has been met?

| Detection method | Coverage |
|-----------------|----------|
| **Code review gate** | Any PR that modifies authentication middleware, adds OAuth/OIDC integration, or changes endpoint access controls MUST be flagged for GRC review |
| **Architecture Decision Records** | Any ADR that changes the auth model must reference this risk capture document |
| **Sprint planning** | When user stories involving self-registration, multi-tenancy, or public access are planned, GRC must be consulted |
| **Deployment checklist** | The deployment checklist (Villager responsibility) must include a check: "Does this deployment widen the auth model?" |

The v0.5.0 AppSec review introduced risk register entries RF-38 through RF-62. This GRC risk capture document covers the transition context for all of them. When triggered, each entry must be re-evaluated using the v0.4.9 vulnerability classification framework with the updated operating context.

| Risk Register Range | Subsystem | Trigger |
|---------------------|-----------|---------|
| RF-38 through RF-43 | Key Discovery (KD-1 to KD-6) | T-1, T-3, T-5 |
| RF-44 through RF-48 | Chain of Trust (CT-1 to CT-4, CT-7) | T-2, T-4, T-10 |

## 8. GRC Risk Classification

Applying the v0.4.9 vulnerability classification framework:

```
Finding:        GRC-RISK-001 -- Auth Model Transition
Our Severity:   P4 (Should Track -- conditional risk, not currently exploitable)
Impact Class:   Governance / process gap -- if triggered without re-review,
                multiple Critical and High findings become exploitable
Preconditions:  1 -- requires a business decision to widen the auth model
Known/Unknown:  Known -- explicitly captured and documented
Fix Risk:       LOW -- the fix is a process gate (mandatory review), not a code change

Decision:       TRACK NOW, ACTION WHEN TRIGGERED
Rationale:      The current high-trust model genuinely mitigates the deprioritised
                findings. The risk is not that the findings exist -- it is that
                the conditions under which they were deprioritised will change.
                The GRC team's job is to ensure the transition includes a security
                gate, not to fix all findings preemptively.

Mitigating factors:
  - All findings are documented in the v0.5.0 AppSec review
  - The current auth model is genuinely high-trust (admin-controlled)
  - No customers yet -- no real user data at risk
  - The trigger conditions are well-defined and detectable
  - The required actions are specific and actionable

Conditions for re-evaluation:
  - Any primary trigger (T-1 through T-5) is met
  - Any secondary trigger (T-6 through T-10) is met
  - Quarterly review (even if no triggers met)

Acceptance period: Until any primary trigger is met
Signed off by:  [PENDING -- requires human approval]
```

## 9. Governance Process

### 9.1 Ownership

| Responsibility | Owner |
|----------------|-------|
| Tracking this risk item | GRC |
| Detecting trigger conditions | GRC + DevOps (deployment checklist) |
| Conducting the re-review when triggered | AppSec (lead), with GRC and Architect |
| Approving the transition | Project Owner (Dinis Cruz) |
| Implementing the security controls | Dev |
| Verifying the controls work | QA |
| Updating the threat model | AppSec |
| Recording the decision | Historian + Librarian |

### 9.2 Review Cadence

| Review type | Frequency | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Quarterly review** | Every 3 months | Confirm no triggers have been met; re-assess timeline for transition |
| **Trigger review** | When any trigger condition is met | Full re-evaluation of all 21 findings |
| **Architecture review** | When PKI subsystems are built | Verify findings are addressed in design before implementation |
| **Pre-deployment review** | Before any auth model change goes to production | Final gate: all blocking findings resolved, human sign-off obtained |

### 9.3 Escalation Path

If a trigger is detected and the development team wishes to proceed without addressing the findings:

1. **GRC documents the request** with specific findings that will become unmitigated
2. **AppSec provides a risk assessment** of proceeding without fixes
3. **Project Owner makes the decision** with full visibility of the risk
4. **If risk is accepted**, GRC creates a formal risk acceptance document (following the v0.4.12 precedent) with specific conditions, monitoring requirements, and an expiry date
5. **No silent acceptance.** The decision must be documented and signed.
