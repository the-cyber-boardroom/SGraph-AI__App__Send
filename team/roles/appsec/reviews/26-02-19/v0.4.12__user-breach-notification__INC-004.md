# Data Breach Notification — INC-004

**To:** Dinis Cruz (affected user)
**From:** SGraph Send — Data Controller
**Date:** 19 February 2026
**Incident Reference:** INC-004
**Classification:** P2-as-P1 (pending content sensitivity assessment)

---

## What Happened

On 19 February 2026, a file you uploaded to SGraph Send was unintentionally made accessible to unauthorised parties through project documentation.

When documenting a separate security incident (INC-003), an AI agent included the **real transfer ID and decryption key** for your file in example URLs within documentation files. These documentation files were then committed and pushed to a GitHub repository branch.

The combination of transfer ID + decryption key is sufficient to download and decrypt any file on SGraph Send. This means that anyone with access to the repository branch during the exposure window could have constructed the download URL, retrieved the encrypted file, and decrypted it.

## What Data Was Exposed

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Transfer ID** | `16bff884b7da` |
| **File type** | Encrypted text |
| **File size** | 7.7 KB |
| **Upload time** | Thu, 19 Feb 2026 15:07:20 GMT |
| **Content (from download page)** | "Enterprise AI Time-to-Value Survey" |
| **Downloads during exposure** | 1 (believed to be your own legitimate download) |

## Exposure Window

| Event | Time |
|-------|------|
| Documentation pushed to GitHub | ~15:50 |
| Transfer ID + decryption key redacted from docs | ~16:12 |
| S3 object (encrypted file) deleted | ~16:20 |
| **Total exposure window** | **~30 minutes** |

---

## Who Could Have Accessed It

During the ~30-minute exposure window, the following parties had potential access:

- Anyone with read access to the GitHub repository branch `claude/read-explorer-guidance-StQko`
- This is a team/private repository — not publicly accessible on the internet
- No evidence of unauthorised downloads (download count: 1)

## Actions Already Taken

| # | Action | Status | Time |
|---|--------|--------|------|
| 1 | Transfer ID and decryption key redacted from all documentation | Done | ~16:12 |
| 2 | Access token redacted from all documentation | Done | ~16:04 |
| 3 | Encrypted file deleted from S3 storage | Done | ~16:20 |
| 4 | Incident classified and escalated to P2-as-P1 | Done | ~16:15 |
| 5 | Data breach notification process created | Done | ~16:30 |

## Remaining Risks

1. **Git history:** The transfer ID and decryption key remain in the git commit history of the branch. Anyone who cloned or fetched the branch retains these values in their local history. However, the encrypted file has been deleted from S3, so even with the key, the data cannot be retrieved.

2. **GitHub caching:** GitHub may cache commit diffs that contained the leaked values. These caches will expire, but the timeline is not within our control.

3. **If the encrypted data was copied:** If anyone downloaded the encrypted file during the ~30-minute window AND retained a copy, they could decrypt it using the key from git history. The download count (1) suggests this did not occur.

## What We Need From You

To complete our regulatory assessment (ICO reporting obligation under UK GDPR), we need you to provide the following information about the exposed file:

### Content Sensitivity Questionnaire

**Please respond to each question:**

1. **What was the general content of the file?**
   _(e.g., a filled-in survey about enterprise AI adoption with your personal responses)_

2. **Did the file contain personal data?**
   _(Names, email addresses, job titles, opinions attributable to you or others)_

3. **Did the file contain special category data?**
   _(Health information, political opinions, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, biometric data, trade union membership, criminal records)_

4. **How would you classify the sensitivity?**
   - [ ] Level 1: Public — data you have already published or would not mind being public
   - [ ] Level 2: Internal — not intended for public but not highly sensitive
   - [ ] Level 3: Confidential — personal data, business-sensitive, or attributable to identifiable individuals
   - [ ] Level 4: Restricted — special category data (health, political, religious, etc.)

5. **What are the potential consequences if this data were seen by an unauthorised party?**
   _(Consider: reputational impact, financial impact, emotional distress, discrimination risk)_

6. **Does the file contain data about any other individuals besides yourself?**
   _(This determines the number of affected data subjects for the ICO assessment)_

7. **Have you taken any additional actions in response to this breach?**
   _(Changed passwords, notified other parties, etc.)_

## What Happens Next

Based on your responses to the questionnaire above:

- **If Level 1-2:** We will document the incident and close it. No ICO notification required.
- **If Level 3:** We will assess whether ICO notification is required within 72 hours of breach awareness (deadline: ~16:15 on 22 February 2026).
- **If Level 4:** ICO notification is mandatory. We will prepare and submit within the 72-hour window.

Regardless of classification, this incident will be fully documented in the project records, and the data breach notification process created in response will prevent similar incidents in future.
