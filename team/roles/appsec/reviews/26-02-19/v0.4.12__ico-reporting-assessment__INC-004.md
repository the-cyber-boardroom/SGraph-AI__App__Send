## 1. Regulatory Framework

Under **UK GDPR Article 33**, the data controller must notify the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) within **72 hours** of becoming aware of a personal data breach, **unless** the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.

Under **UK GDPR Article 34**, the data controller must communicate the breach to the affected data subject without undue delay where the breach is likely to result in a **high risk** to their rights and freedoms.

### Key Thresholds

| Requirement | Threshold | Applies to INC-004? |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **ICO notification (Art. 33)** | Breach likely to result in risk to rights/freedoms | **TBD — depends on content sensitivity** |
| **User notification (Art. 34)** | Breach likely to result in HIGH risk to rights/freedoms | **TBD — depends on content sensitivity** |
| **Documentation (Art. 33(5))** | All breaches regardless of risk level | **Yes — already in progress** |

### 72-Hour Clock

| Event | Time |
|-------|------|
| Breach awareness (human identified data exposure) | ~16:15 on 19 February 2026 |
| **72-hour deadline for ICO notification (if required)** | **~16:15 on 22 February 2026** |

## 2. Breach Facts (for ICO Assessment)

### 2.1 Nature of the Breach

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Type** | Confidentiality breach — unauthorised disclosure |
| **Cause** | Operational process failure — AI agent published real transfer ID and decryption key in documentation committed to a shared Git repository |
| **Vector** | Documentation files in a GitHub branch contained the complete access path (transfer ID + decryption key) to an encrypted file |
| **System involved** | SGraph Send — zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing service |

### 2.2 Data Involved

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Transfer ID** | `16bff884b7da` |
| **File description (from upload metadata)** | "Enterprise AI Time-to-Value Survey" |
| **File type** | Encrypted text, 7.7 KB |
| **Content sensitivity** | **UNKNOWN — awaiting user classification** |
| **Special category data** | **UNKNOWN — awaiting user confirmation** |

### 2.3 Individuals Affected

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Known affected individuals** | 1 (Dinis Cruz — file uploader and data controller) |
| **Potential additional individuals** | **UNKNOWN — the file may contain data about other people (survey responses, names, etc.)** |
| **User notification status** | Breach notification prepared and delivered |

### 2.4 Exposure Window and Access

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Exposure start** | ~15:50 (documentation pushed to GitHub) |
| **Exposure end** | ~16:20 (S3 object permanently deleted) |
| **Total exposure window** | ~30 minutes |
| **Who had access** | Anyone with read access to the GitHub branch (private/team repository) |
| **Evidence of unauthorised access** | No — download count shows 1 (believed to be the user's own legitimate download) |
| **S3 deletion confirmed** | Yes — 16:28, 2 objects (9.0 KB), permanent deletion confirmed |

### 2.5 Containment Actions Taken

| # | Action | Time | Effectiveness |
|---|--------|------|---------------|
| 1 | Access token redacted from 6 documentation files | ~16:04 | Prevents further token exposure via docs (HEAD) |
| 2 | Transfer IDs and decryption keys redacted from 3 documentation files | ~16:12 | Prevents further data access path exposure via docs (HEAD) |
| 3 | S3 object permanently deleted | ~16:20 (confirmed 16:28) | **Most effective** — ciphertext destroyed, decryption key now useless |
| 4 | New SG/Send link created and sent to original recipient | ~16:28 | Original recipient can still access the intended content via a new, uncompromised link |
| 5 | Incident classified P2-as-P1, full breach response initiated | ~16:15 | Formal response chain activated |

## 3. ICO Reporting Decision Matrix

The decision depends on the **content sensitivity classification** provided by the affected user:

### Scenario A: Level 1 — Public Data

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Content | Data the user has already published or would not mind being public |
| Risk to rights/freedoms | Negligible |
| ICO notification required? | **No** |
| User notification required? | Already done (precautionary) |
| Action | Document incident, record reasoning for non-notification, close |

### Scenario B: Level 2 — Internal Data

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Content | Business data not intended for public, but not highly sensitive |
| Risk to rights/freedoms | Low |
| ICO notification required? | **Unlikely** — unless volume or context creates elevated risk |
| User notification required? | Already done (precautionary) |
| Action | Document incident, record reasoning for non-notification, close |

### Scenario C: Level 3 — Confidential Data

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Content | Personal data, business-sensitive data, opinions attributable to identifiable individuals |
| Risk to rights/freedoms | Moderate — depends on specific content |
| ICO notification required? | **Likely yes** — personal data of identifiable individuals exposed |
| User notification required? | **Yes** — already done |
| Action | Prepare ICO notification, submit within 72-hour window |

### Scenario D: Level 4 — Restricted Data (Special Category)

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Content | Health, political opinions, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, biometric, genetic, trade union, criminal records |
| Risk to rights/freedoms | High |
| ICO notification required? | **Mandatory** |
| User notification required? | **Mandatory** — already done |
| Action | Prepare and submit ICO notification immediately |

## 4. Mitigating Factors (Applicable to All Scenarios)

These factors reduce the assessed risk regardless of content sensitivity:

| Factor | Detail | Risk Reduction |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Short exposure window** | ~30 minutes | Limits opportunity for unauthorised access |
| **Private repository** | Branch is on a team/private repository, not public | Limits who could have seen the values |
| **No evidence of unauthorised access** | Download count: 1 (user's own) | Suggests data was not actually accessed by third parties |
| **S3 object deleted** | Ciphertext permanently destroyed | Even with key, data cannot be recovered |
| **Encryption was intact** | The data was encrypted at rest; accessing it required both the transfer ID AND decryption key | Multiple values needed — not a single-point exposure |
| **Rapid response** | <30 minutes from awareness to full containment | Demonstrates appropriate incident handling |
| **Single individual affected** | 1 known affected person (who is also the data controller) | Limits scope |

### Risk Reduction Assessment

Even for Level 3-4 content, the combination of mitigating factors significantly reduces the assessed risk:

1. **The data is irrecoverable.** The S3 object has been permanently deleted. The decryption key is now useless.
2. **No evidence of actual access.** Only 1 download recorded (the user's own).
3. **Limited exposure audience.** Private repository branch — not publicly indexed or accessible.
4. **The affected individual is the data controller.** Dinis Cruz is both the affected user and the data controller, which simplifies the notification and consent process.

## 5. ICO Notification Content (Draft — If Required)

If the content sensitivity assessment determines ICO notification is required (Level 3 or 4), the following information must be submitted:

### 5.1 Mandatory Fields (Article 33(3))

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Nature of the breach** | Confidentiality breach — unauthorised disclosure of access path to encrypted user data via documentation published to a shared code repository |
| **Categories of data** | **[TO BE COMPLETED based on user classification]** |
| **Approximate number of individuals** | 1 (confirmed); **[TO BE COMPLETED — may include additional individuals if the file contains third-party data]** |
| **Approximate number of records** | 1 file (7.7 KB encrypted text) |
| **Name and contact of DPO/contact point** | Dinis Cruz (Data Controller), SGraph Send |
| **Likely consequences** | **[TO BE COMPLETED based on user assessment of potential impact]** |
| **Measures taken to address the breach** | (1) Access path redacted from documentation; (2) Encrypted file permanently deleted from storage; (3) New file link generated and sent to intended recipient; (4) Data breach notification sent to affected user; (5) Formal breach notification process created |
| **Measures taken to mitigate adverse effects** | S3 object deletion renders the decryption key useless; short exposure window (~30 min) on private repository with no evidence of unauthorised access |

### 5.2 Supporting Evidence

| Evidence | Location |
|----------|----------|
| INC-004 incident record | `team/roles/historian/reviews/26-02-19/v0.4.12__incident-record__INC-004__documentation-token-leak.md` |
| Data breach notification process | `team/roles/appsec/reviews/26-02-19/v0.4.12__data-breach-notification-process.md` |
| User breach notification | `team/roles/appsec/reviews/26-02-19/v0.4.12__user-breach-notification__INC-004.md` |
| This assessment | This file |
| S3 deletion confirmation | Screenshots retained by data controller (19 Feb 2026, 16:28) |

## 6. Recommendation

### Current Recommendation (Pre-Classification)

**Wait for user content sensitivity classification before making the ICO reporting decision.**

The 72-hour clock started at ~16:15 on 19 February 2026. The deadline is ~16:15 on 22 February 2026. There is sufficient time to gather the user's classification and make an informed decision.

### Preliminary Assessment

Based on the file metadata ("Enterprise AI Time-to-Value Survey") and the mitigating factors:

- **Most likely scenario:** Level 2 (Internal) — a business survey with non-personal or minimally personal answers. ICO notification **unlikely to be required**.
- **Possible scenario:** Level 3 (Confidential) — if the survey contains personal opinions, business-sensitive responses, or data about identifiable third parties. ICO notification **may be required** but the strong mitigating factors (no evidence of access, data destroyed, private repo, single individual) may support a reasoned decision not to notify.
- **Unlikely scenario:** Level 4 (Restricted) — a "Time-to-Value Survey" is unlikely to contain special category data, but this must be confirmed by the user.

### Actions Required

| # | Action | Owner | Deadline |
|---|--------|-------|----------|
| 1 | **Respond to Content Sensitivity Questionnaire** in the user breach notification | Dinis Cruz (as affected user) | Before 22 Feb 16:15 |
| 2 | **Make final ICO reporting decision** based on classification | Dinis Cruz (as data controller) | Before 22 Feb 16:15 |
| 3 | **If Level 3-4: Prepare ICO submission** using the draft in Section 5 | AppSec + Data Controller | Before 22 Feb 16:15 |
| 4 | **Document the decision** regardless of outcome (Article 33(5) accountability requirement) | Historian | After decision made |

---

## 7. Article 33(5) Accountability Record

Regardless of whether ICO notification is submitted, this document — together with the INC-004 incident record, user breach notification, and data breach notification process — constitutes the Article 33(5) accountability record documenting:

- The facts relating to the breach
- Its effects
- The remedial action taken

This record must be retained for a minimum of 5 years.
