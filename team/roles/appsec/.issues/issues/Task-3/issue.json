  "description": "Questions for the Architect role regarding current security boundaries:\n1. What is the exact auth mechanism for the admin Lambda URL Function? Is it AWS_IAM or a custom header?\n2. What CORS origins are currently configured?\n3. Is the Lambda execution role scoped to minimum permissions or using a broad role?\n4. Are there any network-level controls (VPC, security groups) on the Lambda functions?\n5. How are admin credentials currently managed (env var, Secrets Manager, hardcoded)?",
