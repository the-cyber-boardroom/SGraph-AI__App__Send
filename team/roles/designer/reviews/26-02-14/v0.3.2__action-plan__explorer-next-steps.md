# Designer Action Plan: Explorer Next Steps

**Version:** v0.3.2
**Date:** 14 February 2026
**Role:** Designer (Explorer Team)
**Brief reviewed:** [v0.3.2 daily brief](../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/14/v0.3.2__daily-brief__sgraph-send-14-feb-2026.md)

---

## Overview

The v0.3.2 daily brief assigns the Designer two P1 tasks and one P2 task:

| Priority | Task | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| **P1** | Design agency brief (logo, brand identity, website mockups) | Planning |
| **P1** | Design agency kickoff presentation | Planning |
| **P2** | Landing page "Why not WeTransfer?" positioning | Planning |

This is the Designer role's first review. There are no previous Designer reviews in the repo. The role is being activated to support the first external partner engagement.

---

## 1. Current UX State Assessment

Before briefing an external agency, we need a clear picture of what exists today.

### What Exists (v0.1.4)

The current user UI is a functional MVP built with vanilla JS Web Components. It ships as static HTML/CSS/JS with no framework dependencies.

**Pages:**
- **Upload page** (`index.html`) — token gate, file/text mode tabs, drag-and-drop upload, encryption progress, share link result with copy-to-clipboard
- **Download page** (`download.html`) — transfer info display, key input, auto-decrypt from URL hash, file save / text display, transparency panel

**Components (Web Components):**
- `<send-access-gate>` — token-gated entry, early access sign-up form (LaunchList)
- `<send-upload>` — file drag-and-drop, text input, encrypt-and-upload flow, result display with combined/separate key sharing
- `<send-download>` — URL parsing, API fetch, decrypt-and-save/display, download history (localStorage)
- `<send-transparency>` — "what we stored" / "what we did NOT store" privacy disclosure

**Admin UI** (separate package, `sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__admin`):
- `<admin-shell>` — navigation shell with panel switching
- `<token-manager>` — token CRUD
- `<analytics-dashboard>` — request count monitoring
- `<system-info>` — system health/info

**Design system:**
- Single CSS file (`common.css`) with CSS custom properties (design tokens)
- Colour palette: blue primary (`#2563eb`), light grey background (`#f4f5f7`), white surfaces
- System font stack (`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif`)
- Responsive breakpoint at 480px
- Card-based layout, max-width 640px
- No logo, no brand mark, no visual identity beyond the blue + grey palette
- No theme switching capability yet

**Internationalisation:**
- i18n system active with 4 locales: English, Portuguese (BR), Portuguese (PT), Klingon
- 75+ translatable strings per locale
- Locale selector in top-right corner
- Content decoupled from HTML via `data-i18n` attributes and JSON locale files

### What Is Missing

1. **No logo** — the product is identified only by the text "SGraph Send" in a system font
2. **No brand identity** — colours are developer defaults (blue primary), no personality
3. **No visual hierarchy** on landing** — no hero section, no "why use this?" messaging, no trust signals
4. **No differentiation from WeTransfer** — user feedback confirms the positioning gap
5. **No theme system** — single light theme only, no dark mode, no accessibility themes
6. **No favicon** — browser tab shows default icon
7. **No illustrations or visual language** — pure utility, no emotional design
8. **No onboarding flow** — first-time users see a token gate with no context about what the product does

### Screenshots Needed

The agency will need visual documentation of the current state. The Designer should capture or arrange capture of:
- Upload page (token gate state)
- Upload page (authenticated, idle state)
- Upload page (file selected, ready to encrypt)
- Upload page (encryption/upload progress)
- Upload page (result with share link)
- Download page (transfer info + key input)
- Download page (auto-decrypted text result)
- Download page (file download complete + transparency panel)
- Admin console (token manager, analytics, system info)
- Mobile responsive view of upload and download

These can be captured using Playwright (already in the test stack) or manual screenshots.

---

## 2. Design Agency Brief Plan (P1)

The brief is the primary deliverable. It must give the agency everything they need to produce a comprehensive design system, not just a single design.

### Proposed Structure

**File:** `team/roles/designer/reviews/26-02-14/v0.3.2__design-agency-brief.md`

#### Section 1: Project Context

- What SGraph Send is (zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing)
- How it works (browser-side encryption with AES-256-GCM, server never sees plaintext)
- The privacy proposition (server stores encrypted ciphertext only, no file names, no keys, IP addresses hashed)
- The agentic team structure (17 AI agent roles coordinated by a human project lead)
- Why this matters for the agency (the team that reviews their work is structured, responsive, and has deep context)

**Source material:**
- [Specs index](../../../../../library/docs/specs/README.md)
- [Architect's system landscape map](../../../cartographer/v0.1.2/v0.1.2__system-landscape-map-revised.md)
- [Wardley Maps brief](../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/14/v0.3.2__briefs__wardley-maps-in-sgraph-project.md)

#### Section 2: Current UX State

- Screenshots of all current pages and states (upload, download, admin)
- User flow diagram: open page > token gate > select file > encrypt > copy link > (recipient) open link > decrypt > download
- Technology context: vanilla JS Web Components, CSS custom properties, i18n system
- What works well: the flow is functional, the privacy transparency panel is a differentiator
- What does not work: no visual identity, no trust signals, no differentiation, no onboarding

#### Section 3: Logo Requirements

The logo must work across multiple contexts with strict constraints:

| Variant | Requirement |
|---------|------------|
| **Full colour** | Primary brand mark, used on white/light backgrounds |
| **Black and white** | For monochrome contexts (print, fax, stamps) |
| **High contrast** | For accessibility themes (WCAG AAA, minimum 7:1 contrast ratio) |
| **Visually-impaired-friendly** | Simple silhouette, recognisable at low resolution or with screen magnification |
| **Favicon (16x16, 32x32)** | Recognisable at tiny sizes, distinct in a browser tab |
| **Mobile app icon (512x512)** | For PWA / future mobile scenarios |
| **Large format** | Presentations, signage, landing page hero |
| **Animated variant** | Optional — for loading states or micro-interactions |

The logo should communicate: security, simplicity, trust, and the concept of "sending something safely." It should NOT rely on padlock cliches or generic cloud icons.

The agency should deliver vector formats (SVG) for all variants, plus optimised PNG/WebP at standard sizes.

#### Section 4: Brand Identity Requirements

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|------------|
| **Primary colour palette** | Must work across Aurora, Glacier, and Ember themes (see Section 6) |
| **Semantic colours** | Success, error, warning, info — must work on all theme backgrounds |
| **Typography** | Primary typeface (headings), secondary typeface (body), monospace (code/keys). Must support Latin, Cyrillic, CJK character sets for multilingual use. Prefer open-source / web-safe fonts to avoid licensing friction. |
| **Spacing system** | 4px or 8px base grid, consistent scale |
| **Border radius** | Current is 8px — confirm or revise |
| **Shadow system** | Elevation levels for cards, modals, dropdowns |
| **Icon set** | Style guidelines for custom icons or recommendation of an open-source icon library |
| **Illustration style** | Guidelines for any illustrative elements (onboarding, empty states, error states) |
| **Voice and tone** | Visual personality — is SGraph Send serious/professional, friendly/approachable, technical/precise, or some combination? |

#### Section 5: Website Mockup Requirements

The agency should produce mockups for the following screens/flows:

**User-facing:**

1. **Landing / first impression** — a user arrives at `send.sgraph.ai` for the first time. What do they see? How is the "why not WeTransfer?" question answered in the first 10 seconds? Trust signals, value proposition, call to action.

2. **Upload flow** — the complete journey from selecting a file through encryption to receiving the share link. Must communicate progress, security, and simplicity.

3. **Download flow** — a recipient opens the link. What do they see? How is trust established before they paste the decryption key? The auto-decrypt (key in URL) flow and the manual key entry flow.

4. **Transparency panel** — the "what we stored" disclosure. This is a differentiator and should be designed as a first-class UI element, not an afterthought.

5. **Text mode** — sending encrypted text (not just files). How is this presented alongside file mode?

6. **Token gate / onboarding** — the beta access experience. Currently a bare input field. Should explain what SGraph Send is and why the user should care.

7. **Early access sign-up** — currently a LaunchList form. Should be integrated into the design language.

**Admin-facing:**

8. **Admin console** — token management, analytics dashboard, system health. Professional, data-dense, functional.

**Cross-cutting:**

9. **Mobile responsive** — all of the above, adapted for mobile viewport (down to 320px width).

10. **Error states** — what happens when something goes wrong? Token invalid, transfer not found, decryption failed, network error.

11. **Loading states** — encryption progress, upload progress, download/decrypt progress. These are moments where the user is waiting and trust needs to be maintained.

12. **Empty states** — no transfers yet, no analytics data yet. How do these communicate "get started" rather than "nothing here"?

#### Section 6: Multi-Theme Constraints

This is the most significant design constraint and must be communicated clearly.

SGraph Send supports multiple colour themes. The agency's design must work across all of them. The themes are not an afterthought — they are a core feature.

**Named themes (from project brief):**

| Theme | Description | Emotional register |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Aurora** | Default. Light background, vibrant accents. | Fresh, modern, approachable |
| **Glacier** | Cool-toned, minimal, high clarity. | Professional, calm, precise |
| **Ember** | Warm-toned, darker accents. | Confident, bold, energetic |

**Accessibility themes:**

| Theme | Requirement |
|-------|------------|
| **Dark mode** | Full dark-background variant. Not just "invert colours" — a deliberate dark palette. |
| **High contrast** | WCAG AAA compliant (7:1 minimum contrast ratio). For visually impaired users. |
| **Colour-blind friendly** | Avoid relying on red/green distinction. Use patterns, shapes, or labels as secondary indicators. |

**Design system implication:** The agency's deliverables must define colours as **semantic tokens** (e.g., `--color-primary`, `--color-surface`, `--color-success`) that can be swapped per theme, not as absolute hex values baked into mockups.

The mockups should demonstrate the design in at least Aurora and one accessibility theme (high contrast or dark mode) to prove the system works.

#### Section 7: Multilingual Constraints

The product currently supports 4 languages and will expand. Design constraints:

1. **No text baked into images.** All text must be rendered by the browser from locale files. Any illustrative element must be purely visual.
2. **Layout must accommodate text expansion.** German and Portuguese text is typically 20-30% longer than English. CJK text is typically shorter but taller.
3. **Bidirectional text support.** Future languages may include RTL (Arabic, Hebrew). The layout system must not assume LTR.
4. **Locale-neutral visual language.** Icons, illustrations, and visual metaphors must be culturally neutral or explicitly adapted per locale.

#### Section 8: Design System Requirement

The agency is not producing "a design for SGraph Send." They are producing **a design system** — a set of reusable components, tokens, patterns, and guidelines that the development team (including AI agents) can apply consistently across the product.

Deliverables should include:
- A design token specification (colours, typography, spacing, shadows, radii — per theme)
- Component library documentation (buttons, inputs, cards, status messages, progress bars, etc.)
- Layout patterns (page structure, responsive grid, content containers)
- Interaction patterns (hover, focus, active, disabled states for all interactive elements)
- A sticker sheet / component inventory for developer handoff

The format should be compatible with Web Components implementation — the development team does not use React, Vue, or any framework. Components are vanilla HTML/CSS/JS custom elements.

#### Section 9: Logistics

**Agency:** Cruz & Cruz.

**File sharing:** Deliverables will be shared via SGraph Send itself. Cruz & Cruz becomes a real user and a source of feedback on the product. This serves double duty: the agency tests the product while using it, and any friction they experience is directly relevant user feedback.

**Deliverable formats:**
- Mockups: Figma (preferred) or equivalent with exportable assets
- Design tokens: JSON format compatible with CSS custom properties
- Icons/logos: SVG (vector), PNG/WebP at standard sizes (16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512px)
- Documentation: Markdown (preferred) or PDF
- Fonts: WOFF2 format for web delivery

**Review process:**
- Deliverables are reviewed by the Designer, Architect, Advocate, and Ambassador roles
- Feedback is structured and specific (not "I don't like it" but "this doesn't communicate trust because...")
- The agency has access to a project-aware Claude bot for Q&A (if the Architect's research on this completes in time — see [Architect next steps](../../../architect/reviews/26-02-14/v0.3.0__review__next-steps-from-wardley-briefs.md), item E6)

---

## 3. Kickoff Presentation Plan (P1)

The kickoff deck is the companion to the written brief. It is designed for a meeting (video call or in-person) where the agency is walked through the project for the first time.

### Proposed Structure

**File:** `team/roles/designer/reviews/26-02-14/v0.3.2__kickoff-presentation.md` (outline)
**Format:** Presentation deck (Google Slides, Keynote, or equivalent), exported as PDF for sharing via SGraph Send.

#### Slide Outline

| # | Slide | Content | Duration |
|---|-------|---------|----------|
| 1 | **Title** | "SGraph Send: Design Agency Kickoff" — date, participants | 30s |
| 2 | **The Product** | What SGraph Send does in one sentence. Visual diagram of the encryption flow (browser > encrypted upload > recipient > browser decryption). | 2 min |
| 3 | **The Problem** | Why this exists. File sharing is easy. Secure file sharing is not. The gap between "I can send a file" and "I can send a file that nobody else can read." | 2 min |
| 4 | **The Differentiator** | Zero-knowledge architecture. The server never sees your file. Compared to WeTransfer (server has plaintext), Dropbox (server has plaintext), email (server has plaintext). | 3 min |
| 5 | **The User Feedback** | "Why not just WeTransfer?" — this is the positioning gap we need the design to solve. Also: "This is really useful for big files" — the sweet spot. | 2 min |
| 6 | **Current State Demo** | Live walkthrough or recorded video of the upload-encrypt-share-download flow. Show what works, show what's rough. | 5 min |
| 7 | **What We Need** | Logo, brand identity, website mockups, design system. Not a single design — a system. Multi-theme, multilingual, accessible. | 3 min |
| 8 | **Theme System** | Aurora, Glacier, Ember. Dark mode, high contrast, colour-blind friendly. Visual examples of how the same page looks across themes. | 3 min |
| 9 | **The Team** | How the agentic team works. 17 roles, two teams (Explorer/Villager). The agency will interact with the Designer, Architect, Advocate, and Ambassador roles. Possibly via a Claude bot. | 2 min |
| 10 | **Logistics** | File sharing via SGraph Send. Deliverable formats. Review process. Timeline. | 2 min |
| 11 | **Questions** | Open floor. | 5 min |

**Total estimated duration:** 30 minutes + Q&A.

### Visual Assets Needed for the Deck

- Architecture diagram (simplified — browser encryption flow)
- Current UI screenshots (all states)
- Theme mockup examples (even rough ones — showing the same card in Aurora, Glacier, Ember, dark, high contrast)
- Competitor comparison (WeTransfer, Dropbox, OnionShare — visual positioning)

**Dependencies:**
- Architect for the architecture diagram
- Screenshots from current deployment or Playwright captures
- Theme rough mockups can be created by the Designer by varying the CSS custom properties in `common.css`

---

## 4. Landing Page "Why Not WeTransfer?" Plan (P2)

User feedback was clear: "Why are we reinventing WeTransfer?" The landing page must answer this in the first 10 seconds.

### Approach

The current landing page goes directly to the token gate. There is no "what is this?" moment. A first-time visitor sees a lock icon and a token input field. That communicates nothing about the product.

**Proposed landing page structure:**

1. **Hero section** — one-line value proposition + visual. Not "Zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing" (too technical). Something closer to "Send files that only the right person can open." Visual: a file going through a shield/tunnel/lock, with the server shown as unable to see inside.

2. **The comparison** — a simple visual comparison:
   - WeTransfer: your file sits on their server, readable by anyone with access.
   - SGraph Send: your file is encrypted before it leaves your browser. The server only sees encrypted noise.
   - This can be a side-by-side diagram or a before/after visual.

3. **Trust signals** — "We cannot read your files. Here's proof." Link to the transparency panel concept. Show what the server stores vs. what it does not store.

4. **How it works** — 3-step visual: (1) Select file, (2) Encrypted in your browser, (3) Share the link. The key stays with you.

5. **Call to action** — "Try it now" (if public) or "Request early access" (if beta-gated).

### Dependencies

- **Advocate** — for user personas and language that resonates with target users
- **Ambassador** — for competitive positioning (WeTransfer, Dropbox, OnionShare, Keybase, Tresorit)
- **Journalist** — for copy that is clear, compelling, and avoids jargon

### Note

This is P2 and can wait until after the agency brief and kickoff are delivered. However, the landing page structure should be included in the agency brief (Section 5, item 1) as one of the mockup requirements. The agency may produce a better solution than anything we rough out internally.

---

## 5. Dependencies

The Designer cannot produce these deliverables alone. The following roles need to provide input:

| Role | What the Designer Needs | Priority | Status |
|------|------------------------|----------|--------|
| **Architect** | Simplified architecture diagram (browser encryption flow, Lambda topology). Technical constraints for the agency brief (what the design must NOT do — e.g., no server-side rendering of user content). | P1 | Architect's [next-steps review](../../../architect/reviews/26-02-14/v0.3.0__review__next-steps-from-wardley-briefs.md) is available. Need a visual diagram extracted from it. |
| **Advocate** | User personas — primary persona is now the **Early Adopter** (friendly, WhatsApp-reachable, zero-to-expert security knowledge). Need Advocate to flesh out pain points, language, and comparison points for this persona. | P1 | Primary persona defined by project lead (15 Feb). Advocate review still needed to expand. |
| **Ambassador** | Competitive positioning — how does SGraph Send sit relative to WeTransfer, Dropbox, OnionShare, Tresorit? What is the one-line differentiator? | P1 | No Ambassador review found. Need to request. |
| **Journalist** | Copy for the agency brief introduction — explaining the product to an external audience in clear, non-technical language. | P2 | Can proceed without, but quality improves with Journalist input. |
| **Cartographer** | Wardley Map visualisation showing the design/brand component at Genesis stage. Useful context for the agency to understand their role in the project evolution. | P3 | [Wardley Maps brief](../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/14/v0.3.2__briefs__wardley-maps-in-sgraph-project.md) provides the raw data. Need a visual. |
| **DevOps** | Access to the deployed application for screenshots and demo recording. URL for the current deployment. | P1 | Deployment exists at send.sgraph.ai. |

---

## 6. Timeline

### Proposed Sequence

```
Day 1 (14 Feb — today)
  [x] Read brief, assess current state, produce this action plan
  [ ] Request inputs from Architect, Advocate, Ambassador
  [ ] Capture current UI screenshots (or arrange Playwright captures)
  [ ] Create rough theme mockups (vary CSS custom properties for Aurora/Glacier/Ember)

Day 2 (15 Feb)
  [ ] Draft design agency brief (Sections 1-5)
  [ ] Draft design agency brief (Sections 6-9)
  [ ] Integrate Architect, Advocate, Ambassador inputs as they arrive

Day 3 (16 Feb)
  [ ] Finalise design agency brief — internal review
  [ ] Draft kickoff presentation outline
  [ ] Create/source visual assets for the deck

Day 4 (17 Feb)
  [ ] Finalise kickoff presentation
  [ ] Share brief and deck via SGraph Send (dogfooding)
  [ ] Agency kickoff meeting

Day 5+ (post-kickoff)
  [ ] Begin P2: landing page "Why not WeTransfer?" rough design
  [ ] Process agency questions and feedback
  [ ] Iterate on brief as needed based on agency input
```

### Risks to Timeline

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Advocate/Ambassador inputs not available in time | Proceed with Designer's best assessment. Mark sections as "pending persona/positioning review" and update after. |
| No access to deployed application for screenshots | Use Playwright to render pages locally. The test stack runs in-memory in ~100ms. |
| Agency timeline faster/slower than expected | The brief is self-contained. It can be delivered whenever the agency is ready to receive it. |
| Theme mockups require design skill the AI agent lacks | Produce CSS custom property variations only (colour swaps). The agency produces the real visual design. |

## 8. Resolved Questions (15 Feb 2026)

All seven open questions have been answered by the project lead. Decisions recorded below.

| # | Question | Decision |
|---|----------|----------|
| 1 | **Agency identity** | The agency is **Cruz & Cruz**. The brief is for them specifically. |
| 2 | **Budget/scope** | Covered outside this project — proceed with the comprehensive brief as planned. |
| 3 | **Timeline** | Days, not weeks. The agency is expected to turn around quickly. |
| 4 | **Theme names** | **Confirmed.** Aurora, Glacier, Ember are final. |
| 5 | **Product name** | **Confirmed.** "SGraph Send" is the final product name. |
| 6 | **Target audience priority** | **New persona: "Early Adopter"** (see below). Not enterprise, not general consumer — a specific individual we can reach directly. |
| 7 | **Existing brand guidelines** | No formal brand guidelines exist yet. Share what we have so far — especially the 3 confirmed themes and the accessibility modes. The agency can build from there. |

### Primary Persona: Early Adopter

This is the priority persona for the first design pass. The mockups and landing page should be designed for this person.

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Label** | Early Adopter |
| **Relationship** | Friendly, reachable directly via WhatsApp |
| **Tech savvy** | Reasonably computer savvy (not a developer, but comfortable with technology) |
| **Security knowledge** | Full range — from "none" to "expert". The design must work for both ends. |
| **Purpose of engagement** | Get feedback on platform usability; validate that observability and logging are working correctly |
| **Communication channel** | Direct (WhatsApp), not anonymous or at-scale |
| **Key design implication** | The UI must be clear enough for someone with zero security knowledge, while not patronising someone with expert knowledge. Error messages, transparency panels, and trust signals must work across this spectrum. |
| **Key engineering implication** | Every interaction must be observable — the team needs to see what the user did, where they got stuck, what succeeded, what failed. This is not just UX polish, it's infrastructure validation. |

**Impact on the brief:** This persona replaces the generic "individual users vs. enterprise" framing. The agency brief (Section 5) should describe mockups through the lens of this Early Adopter — someone who is friendly, reachable, and whose feedback loop is direct and fast. The design should optimise for "I sent this to my friend and they could use it without asking me questions."
