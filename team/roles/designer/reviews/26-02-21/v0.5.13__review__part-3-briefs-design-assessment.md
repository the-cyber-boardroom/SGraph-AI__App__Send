## Key Design Observations

### Data Room UX

The briefs include ASCII wireframes for all major screens:
- Entry page with key input and "Remember this key" checkbox
- File browser distinguishing persistent (GitHub) vs ephemeral (uploaded) files with TTL display
- Directory with personas showing verification level indicators
- Message thread UI with attachments
- Custom branding (logo, colours from config)

**Design system need**: the data room UI must be theme-able per customer. Branding comes from `theme.json` in the GitHub repo (colours, fonts). The design system must support this customisation without breaking layout.

### Agent Chat UI

Three main components:
1. Agent selector dropdown (19 roles)
2. Provider selector with status indicators (API key configured, service reachable, etc.)
3. Chat area with context viewer panel

The "View loaded context" expandable panel is important for transparency — users can see exactly what the agent knows.

### Team Site

The meeting room metaphor (grid of agent cards) is strong. Each card needs:
- Role name and icon
- Short description
- [Chat] action
- Current focus indicator

The LLM provider selection for public visitors needs careful UX: Chrome AI (free) vs bring-your-own-key vs free preview tier. This is a conversion funnel decision.

## Action Items

1. Create design tokens for theme-able data room branding
2. Design the provider selection flow for public visitors (Chrome AI default)
3. Refine the agent card grid layout for the team site
4. Design the file visualizer UI (PDF, markdown, images in sandboxed iframes)
