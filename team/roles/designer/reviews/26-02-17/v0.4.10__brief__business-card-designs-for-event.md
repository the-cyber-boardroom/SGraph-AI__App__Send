# v0.4.10 -- Business Card Design Brief: SG/Send Beta Invite Cards

**Version:** v0.4.10
**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Roles:** Designer (lead), Sherpa (user journey), Ambassador (messaging)
**Type:** Design brief + deliverables
**Urgency:** HIGH -- event tomorrow evening (18 Feb), cards need to print today
**Card size:** 85 x 55 mm (standard European business card)

---

## Context

Dinis is attending an evening event on 18 February with potential SG/Send users. He needs physical cards to hand out that give recipients everything they need to try the product: the URL, a value proposition, and an access code.

This brief defines three design concepts, each produced in three formats:
1. **HTML** -- printable in any browser, exact dimensions, editable tokens
2. **SVG** -- scalable, professional print-ready, editable in any vector tool
3. **LLM image prompts** -- for generating polished visual versions via ChatGPT/DALL-E, Midjourney, etc.

## Key Information on Every Card

From the Villager brief (16 Feb) and Ambassador messaging:

| Element | Content | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Brand** | SG/Send | The slash is the hero element (D045) |
| **URL** | send.sgraph.ai | Primary URL |
| **Tagline** | Varies by design (see below) | One line, max ~60 chars |
| **Token area** | `{TOKEN}` placeholder | Blank for batch printing, handwritten or stamped per card |
| **QR code** | Links to `https://send.sgraph.ai` | Optional: can include `?token={TOKEN}` |
| **What it is** | Zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing | Must be clear to non-technical audience |

---

## Sherpa Perspective: The User Journey From Card to Product

The card is the first touchpoint. The recipient's journey:

1. **Receives card** at an event (conversation with Dinis)
2. **Reads it later** (maybe that evening, maybe next day)
3. **Scans QR code or types URL** into their phone/laptop browser
4. **Enters the access token** from the card
5. **Tries the product** -- uploads a file, sees the encryption, shares it

**Friction points the card must solve:**
- **"What is this?"** -- the card must explain the product in one sentence
- **"How do I use it?"** -- URL + token must be visually obvious
- **"Why should I care?"** -- the value proposition must resonate in 3 seconds
- **"Will I remember?"** -- the card must be worth keeping, not discarding

**Sherpa recommendation:** The token should be handwritten or stamped, not pre-printed. This creates a personal touch ("Dinis wrote this for me") and allows different tokens per conversation. The card should have a clearly marked blank area for this.

## Ambassador Perspective: Messaging Hierarchy

From the Ambassador's competitive analysis and User A's validation:

**Primary message (3-second read):** Zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing. No app needed. No account needed.

**User A's quote (the killer validation):** "I can't tell you how many times I've needed something like this. If you use Signal, Proton, or whatever else, the other party needs the same tech."

**Differentiator to emphasise:** The recipient doesn't need to install anything, create an account, or use a specific app. They just need a browser and the key.

**Ambassador recommendation:** Lead with what makes SG/Send different, not what it does. Everyone knows what file sharing is. The unique proposition is: **the server can't read your files, and the recipient doesn't need anything but a browser.**

---

## Design A: "The Minimal"

**Concept:** Clean, typographic, black on white. Maximum information density with zero visual noise. The kind of card a security-conscious person would design.

**Front:**
```
SG/Send

Zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing
Your files are encrypted in your browser.
The server can never read them.

send.sgraph.ai
```

**Back:**
```
HOW TO USE

1. Go to send.sgraph.ai
2. Enter your access code (below)
3. Drop a file -- it encrypts in your browser
4. Share the link + key via separate channels

ACCESS CODE
______________________________

[QR CODE]        No app. No account.
                 Just a browser.
```

**Design notes:** Monospace or clean sans-serif. Black text on white card. Generous whitespace. The access code area is a blank line for handwriting. QR code bottom-left. The back is the functional side; the front is the brand side.

---

## Design B: "The Slash"

**Concept:** Brand-forward. The "/" from SG/Send becomes a large diagonal graphic element that divides the card into two zones. Bold, modern, memorable.

**Front:**
```
        SG
    ━━━━/━━━━
      Send

  Zero-knowledge
  encrypted sharing
```

**Back:**
```
  send.sgraph.ai        [QR]

  Your access code:
  ┌─────────────────┐
  │                 │
  └─────────────────┘

  The server can't read your files.
  No app needed. No account needed.
```

**Design notes:** The slash is oversized, running corner-to-corner as a design element. Two-colour: black + one accent (deep blue #1a365d or teal #0d9488). The slash creates a dynamic diagonal composition. The access code box is a defined rectangle for writing.

---

## Design C: "The Quote"

**Concept:** Social proof-led. User A's quote as the centrepiece. Let a real user's words do the selling.

**Front:**
```
"I can't tell you how many
times I've needed something
like this."
              -- Beta user, security professional

  SG/Send
  send.sgraph.ai
```

**Back:**
```
  ZERO-KNOWLEDGE FILE SHARING

  Your files are encrypted in your
  browser before they leave your device.
  The server stores only encrypted bytes
  it cannot read.

  No app. No sign-up. Just a browser.

  YOUR ACCESS CODE:
  ______________________________

  [QR CODE]
```

**Design notes:** The quote in a larger or italic typeface. Attribution is anonymised but credible ("security professional"). The back provides the explanation. This design works well for an audience that responds to peer validation.

---

## Design D: "The Two-Sided Minimal"

**Concept:** Ultra-clean. Front is purely brand. Back is purely functional. Inspired by premium product packaging -- nothing extraneous.

**Front:**
```
           SG/Send

  Zero-knowledge encrypted
       file sharing

      send.sgraph.ai
```

**Back:**
```
  Scan to try it:

  [LARGE QR CODE centred]

  Access code: ________________

  Files encrypted in your browser.
  Server never sees plaintext.
```

**Design notes:** The front is centred, balanced, elegant. The back is dominated by a large QR code (makes scanning easy in low light at an event). Minimal text on back. The QR code does the heavy lifting.

## Output Formats

### HTML Files
Location: `sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__user/assets/cards/html/`

Each design is a self-contained HTML file with:
- Exact 85x55mm dimensions via CSS `@page` and `mm` units
- Print-ready (File > Print from browser)
- Editable token field (type directly into the page before printing)
- Both front and back on one page (fold or print double-sided)
- A4 sheet variant with 10 cards per page and cut lines

### SVG Files
Location: `sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__user/assets/cards/svg/`

Each design as a standalone SVG:
- Exact 85x55mm viewBox
- Editable text elements
- Print-ready at any resolution
- Separate front and back SVGs

### LLM Image Prompts
Location: `sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__user/assets/cards/prompts/`

For each design, a detailed prompt that can be pasted into ChatGPT/DALL-E, Midjourney, or similar tools to generate a polished visual mockup. The prompts specify dimensions, colours, typography style, and layout.

---

## Printing Notes

**For home printing (tonight):**
- Print the A4 sheet variant (10 cards per page)
- Use heavy paper/card stock if available (250gsm+)
- Cut along the dotted guides
- Handwrite the access token on each card

**For professional printing (future):**
- Use the SVG files
- 350gsm card stock, matte or soft-touch finish
- The token area is intentionally blank for handwriting or stamping

---

## QR Code Generation

The QR code should encode: `https://send.sgraph.ai`

Optionally with token: `https://send.sgraph.ai/?token={TOKEN}`

For the handwritten-token workflow, the QR encodes just the base URL. The user types the token after scanning.

**Note for Dev:** The QR codes in the HTML/SVG files use a placeholder. For actual printing, generate QR codes using any online tool or the `qrcode` Python library.
