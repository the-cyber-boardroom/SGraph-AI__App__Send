# Design Agency Brief: Cruz & Cruz — Addendum A

**Version:** v0.3.7
**Date:** 15 February 2026
**From:** Designer (SGraph Send team)
**To:** Cruz & Cruz — Design Agency
**Supplements:** `v0.3.3__brief__cruz-and-cruz-design-agency.md` (original brief)

---

## Purpose

This addendum adds a **naming exercise** to the scope of work defined in the original brief. It was triggered by your feedback during the kickoff review — specifically, the observation that "graph" doesn't communicate intuitively to end users in a file-sharing context. We'd like you to explore this formally as part of the brand identity work.

---

## A1. The Naming Challenge

The current product name is **SGraph Send**. The parent brand is **SGraph AI**, with a planned product family (`SGraph Send`, `SGraph Image`, `SGraph Text`, `SGraph Billing`).

As outlined in §3 of the original brief, the "S" in SGraph carries multiple meanings (Secure, Semantic, Simple, Send, Share), and "Graph" connects to our underlying technology platform. The name was chosen for technical accuracy and namespace uniqueness.

However, your kickoff feedback highlighted what we've suspected: **"graph" creates friction**. It's abstract, it's technical, and it doesn't connect to what the product *does* for users. For a product whose design goal is to make encryption feel effortless (not scary), the name shouldn't require explanation.

We're not committed to changing the name — there are good strategic reasons to keep it. But we want to see what alternatives look like, properly explored, before we decide.

---

## A2. What We're Asking For

### A naming exploration covering three tiers:

**Tier 1 — Shorthand for the current name**

The full name "SGraph Send" may not need to change if we find a strong shorthand that works as the everyday brand. We've been exploring **SG/Send** internally — the forward slash as a visual separator, with "SG" as the brand prefix and the product word after the slash.

We'd like you to evaluate this direction and propose alternatives in the same spirit: ways to abbreviate or reframe "SGraph Send" without replacing it entirely.

Things to explore:
- `SG/Send` — does the slash work typographically? As a logo? At favicon scale?
- Other abbreviation patterns — `S.Send`, `S:Send`, `S>Send`, or something we haven't considered
- How the shorthand extends to the product family — does the pattern hold for `SG/Image`, `SG/Text`?
- How the parent brand works — `SG/` as a standalone mark?

**Tier 2 — Alternative names (keeping "Send")**

If "SGraph" were replaced entirely, what could the product be called while keeping "Send" as the action word? The constraint: the name must work across the product family (replacing "Send" with "Image", "Text", etc.).

We're not looking for hundreds of options — **3 to 5 strong candidates** with rationale for each. For each candidate, show:
- The product name (e.g., `[Brand] Send`)
- The family extension (e.g., `[Brand] Image`, `[Brand] Text`)
- A one-line rationale
- Domain availability considerations (we currently own `sgraph.ai` and `sgraph.com`)
- How it would look as a typographic mark

**Tier 3 — Alternative names (complete freedom)**

If you could name this product anything — no constraints from the current name — what would you call it? Same format: 3 to 5 candidates, each with family extension, rationale, and typographic treatment.

The only hard constraints:
- Must communicate security or privacy without being intimidating (no "Vault", "Fortress", "Shield")
- Must feel modern and approachable (not enterprise jargon)
- Must work internationally (avoid words with negative connotations in major languages)
- Must have a viable domain path (either a clean `.com`/`.ai` or a subdomain pattern)

---

## A3. Context for the Exercise

### Why we might keep "SGraph"

- The semantic graph vision justifies "graph" once SGraph Text ships — users will literally see graph visualisations of their documents
- "SGraph" is unique — zero SEO competition, no trademark conflicts
- We own both `sgraph.ai` and `sgraph.com`
- Renaming later is harder than renaming now, but renaming prematurely loses a name that may earn itself

### Why we might change it

- The product needs to feel instantly understandable to non-technical users
- Our target personas include everyday users, not just developers
- "Graph" is a barrier to the "effortless encryption" positioning
- First impressions matter — if the name needs explaining, we've already lost a beat

### What we value in a name

| Quality | Why |
|---------|-----|
| **Immediately understood** | The user should grasp the product category in under 2 seconds |
| **Feels safe, not scary** | Security products often sound intimidating — we want the opposite |
| **Works as a verb** | "I'll [name] it to you" — usable in conversation |
| **Distinctive** | Not generic, not easily confused with competitors |
| **Scalable** | Works for a product family, not just one product |
| **Typographically interesting** | Gives you something to work with for the logo |

## A4. Deliverable

Add the following to the deliverables listed in §8 of the original brief:

| # | Deliverable | Description |
|---|------------|-------------|
| 6 | **Naming exploration** | Tier 1 (shorthand options, 3–5), Tier 2 (alternative names keeping "Send", 3–5), Tier 3 (complete freedom, 3–5). Each option with: name, family extension, one-line rationale, typographic treatment, domain considerations. |

### Format

A single presentation or document with all three tiers. Each candidate name should include a rough typographic treatment — not a finished logo, just enough to show how the name *looks*, not just how it reads. We respond best to visual options rather than word lists.

### Timing

This can run in parallel with the logo exploration in Phase 1. In fact, the naming exercise should **inform** the logo work — if a name candidate is significantly stronger than the current name, we want to know before the logo direction is locked.

---

## A5. What This Doesn't Change

Everything in the original brief remains in scope and unchanged. This addendum adds a deliverable; it doesn't modify existing ones. Specifically:

- The logo exploration (original brief §8, deliverable 1) should proceed with "SGraph Send" and "SG/Send" as the working names
- If the naming exercise surfaces a strong alternative, we'll discuss before Phase 2 — no need to wait for naming to be resolved before starting logo concepts
- The design system, mockups, and theme work are name-agnostic — they can proceed regardless

---

## A6. Our Promise

We won't ask you to name the product and then ignore it. If you propose something strong, we'll take it seriously. If we ultimately keep "SGraph", we'll explain why — and we'll likely adopt whatever shorthand or typographic treatment you develop. Either way, the naming exercise directly feeds the logo and brand identity work.
