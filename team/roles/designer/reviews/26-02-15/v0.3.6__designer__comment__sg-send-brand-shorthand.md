# SGraph Send v0.3.5 — Designer Comment: "SG/Send" as Brand Shorthand

**Version:** v0.3.6  
**Date:** 15 February 2026  
**From:** Designer  
**To:** All roles — for discussion
**Triggered by:** CC-F001 (Cruz & Cruz uncertainty about the word "graph")
**Purpose:** Explore "SG/Send" as a simplified way to refer to SGraph Send, and its potential as a logo direction.

> For Cruz & Cruz feedback see `v0.3.5__designer__cruz-and-cruz-feedback-raw.md`. For brand family context see `v0.3.3__brief__cruz-and-cruz-design-agency.md` §3. For the Designer role document see [Designer](v0.3.5__designer.md).

## 1. The Idea

Use **SG/Send** as the everyday shorthand for "SGraph Send" — in conversation, in UI chrome, and potentially as the logo mark itself. The full name "SGraph Send" remains the formal product name. The domain stays `send.sgraph.ai`.

The forward slash is the key design element: it acts as a visual separator, a nod to URL paths, and a distinctive typographic mark.

---

## 2. Why This Works

### 2a. It Solves the "Graph" Problem Without Removing It

Cruz & Cruz flagged uncertainty about "graph" (CC-F001). Users and designers don't immediately connect "graph" to file sharing. But removing it would break the product family naming.

"SG/Send" keeps the SGraph DNA through the "SG" prefix while foregrounding the action word "Send" — which is immediately understood by everyone. Users see "Send". The technically curious see "SG" and can discover that it stands for SGraph. Nobody needs to process "graph" in a file-sharing context.

### 2b. It Scales Across the Product Family

The pattern extends naturally:

| Product | Full Name | Shorthand | Domain |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| File sharing | SGraph Send | **SG/Send** | send.sgraph.ai |
| Image processing | SGraph Image | **SG/Image** | image.sgraph.ai |
| Text generation | SGraph Text | **SG/Text** | text.sgraph.ai |
| Billing | SGraph Billing | **SG/Billing** | billing.sgraph.ai |
| Parent brand | SGraph AI | **SG/** | sgraph.ai |

The parent brand becomes **SG/** — the slash with nothing after it, implying "SG/anything". This is unusual enough to be memorable and creates a visual system: the SG prefix is the brand anchor, the slash is the brand mark, and the word after the slash is the product.

### 2c. The Slash Has Multiple Resonances

The `/` character carries useful associations:

| Association | Why It Works |
|-------------|-------------|
| **URL paths** | `send.sgraph.ai` — the product literally lives at a path. The slash feels native to the web. |
| **Division / separation** | Echoes the zero-knowledge architecture — your data is separated from our servers. |
| **Forward motion** | A forward slash leans right — it implies direction, progress, sending. |
| **Terminal / CLI** | Appeals to the Tech-Savvy Developer persona. Feels like a command. |
| **Conciseness** | Two characters + a word. No wasted syllables. |

### 2d. It's Speakable

"SG Send" is two syllables plus one word. Clean in conversation: "Just use SG Send." "I'll SG Send it to you." The slash is silent when spoken but present when written — similar to how "w/" is written but "with" is spoken.

---

## 3. Logo Exploration

### 3a. Typographic Mark

The strongest logo direction is purely typographic — no icon needed. The slash itself is the mark.

```
SG/Send
```

Design variables to explore:

| Variable | Options |
|----------|---------|
| **Slash weight** | Same weight as text / heavier (acts as divider) / lighter (subtle) |
| **Slash colour** | Accent colour (teal from current palette) / gradient / same as text |
| **Slash angle** | Standard (/) / steeper / custom angle |
| **Typography** | Monospace (technical) / geometric sans (modern) / custom letterforms |
| **SG treatment** | Same weight as "Send" / lighter (prefix feels secondary) / bolder (brand anchor) |
| **Case** | SG/Send (mixed) / sg/send (lowercase) / SG/SEND (uppercase) |

### 3b. Mark Variants

The brief to Cruz & Cruz already requested multiple logo variants (CC-F014 in the original brief). Here's how SG/Send maps to each:

| Variant | Execution |
|---------|-----------|
| **Full lockup** | `SG/Send` — complete typographic mark |
| **Icon / mark** | `SG/` — just the prefix and slash, works at small sizes |
| **Monogram** | `S/` or `/S` — minimal, favicon-ready |
| **Favicon (16×16)** | The slash alone, or `S/` in a tight square |
| **Product family** | `SG/Send`, `SG/Image`, `SG/Text` — consistent system |
| **Parent brand** | `SG/` — the slash trailing, implying extensibility |

### 3c. Favicon Advantage

Most logos struggle at 16×16. A typographic mark built around a slash has an advantage: the slash is a single stroke that remains legible at any size. Even at favicon scale, `S/` or just `/` with the right weight would be recognisable.

### 3d. The Slash as Visual System

Beyond the logo, the slash could become a broader visual element:

- **Section dividers** in the UI — angled lines echoing the slash
- **Progress indicators** — the slash as a moving element during upload/download (connects to CC-F004)
- **Background patterns** — subtle repeated slashes as texture
- **Navigation** — breadcrumb-style: `SG / Send / Upload`

---

## 4. Domain Compatibility

The shorthand works with the existing domain structure:

| Context | What Users See |
|---------|---------------|
| Browser address bar | `send.sgraph.ai` |
| Logo on page | `SG/Send` |
| Conversation | "Use SG Send" |
| Marketing | "SG/Send — encrypted file sharing" |
| Link text | "Send files with SG/Send" |

There's no conflict — the logo says `SG/Send`, the domain says `send.sgraph.ai`, and both make sense independently. The subdomain pattern (`send.sgraph.ai`) actually reinforces the SG/ pattern: the domain structure mirrors the brand structure.

If `sgraph.com` is also available, `send.sgraph.com` works identically. Both `.ai` and `.com` domains are compatible.

---

## 5. Potential Concerns

### 5a. Does the Slash Cause Technical Problems?

In URLs, filenames, and some systems, `/` is a reserved character. This matters for:

| Context | Issue? | Mitigation |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| URLs | No — it's a brand name, not a URL component | N/A |
| Filenames | Possible — `SG/Send` can't be a filename on most OS | Use `SG-Send` or `SGSend` for filenames |
| Social media handles | Possible — `/` not allowed in handles | Use `SGSend` or `SG.Send` for handles |
| Hashtags | Yes — `#SG/Send` doesn't work | Use `#SGSend` |
| Search/SEO | Minor — users might search "SG Send" without slash | Both forms should be indexed |

These are manageable. The slash is a *visual* brand element, not a literal one. In contexts where `/` isn't supported, `SGSend` works as the fallback.

### 5b. Does "SG" Mean Anything Else?

| "SG" usage | Context | Risk |
|-----------|---------|------|
| Singapore (country code) | ISO 3166 | Low — different context entirely |
| Stargate | Entertainment | None |
| Solicitor General | Legal | None |
| SG (various companies) | Various | Low — the `/Send` suffix disambiguates |

No meaningful conflict. "SG" alone is generic; "SG/" or "SG/Send" is distinctive.

### 5c. Will Users Understand That SG = SGraph?

Probably not immediately, and that's fine. Most users don't need to know that SG stands for SGraph — "SG/Send" works as a standalone name. The connection to SGraph becomes relevant when users encounter the product family or the parent brand, at which point the pattern (`SG/Send`, `SG/Image`, `SG/Text`) makes the relationship self-evident.

---

## 6. Comparison With Alternatives

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **SGraph Send** (current) | Full name, clear lineage | "Graph" confuses non-technical users (CC-F001) |
| **SG/Send** (proposed) | Clean, scalable, distinctive mark | Slash has technical constraints in some contexts |
| **SG Send** (no slash) | Simple, no special characters | Loses the distinctive visual element; "SG Send" is generic |
| **S/Send** (shorter) | Very minimal | Too close to "s/end" (sed command — confusing for developers) |
| **sgraph.send** (dot) | Domain-like | Looks like an actual domain, confusing |
| **.send** (prefix) | Trendy | Doesn't carry the SG brand |

SG/Send is the strongest option. It's distinctive enough to trademark, simple enough to remember, and systematic enough to scale.

---

## 7. Recommendation

**Propose "SG/Send" to Cruz & Cruz as a brand direction** alongside the full "SGraph Send" name. Ask them to explore:

1. Typographic treatments of `SG/Send` as the primary mark
2. The `SG/` prefix as the parent brand mark
3. The slash as a visual system element (dividers, progress indicators, background patterns)
4. Favicon treatments of `S/` or the slash alone
5. The full family: `SG/Send`, `SG/Image`, `SG/Text`

This doesn't replace the "SGraph Send" name — it layers a usable shorthand on top. The formal name is still SGraph Send. The brand mark is SG/Send. The spoken name is "SG Send". All three coexist.

#### Proposed Decision

**D051: "SG/Send" adopted as brand shorthand and primary logo direction.** Full name "SGraph Send" retained for formal contexts. "SG/" prefix establishes product family visual system. Cruz & Cruz to explore typographic mark treatments.

## Document Lineage

This comment document was triggered by CC-F001 (Cruz & Cruz uncertainty about "graph") and a subsequent idea to use "SG/Send" as a simplified brand reference. It builds on the brand family structure defined in the original agency brief (`v0.3.3__brief__cruz-and-cruz-design-agency.md` §3) and the kickoff presentation (slides 8, 14).
