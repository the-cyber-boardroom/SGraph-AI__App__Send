# Brief: Kickoff Presentation for Cruz & Cruz

**Version:** v0.3.3
**Date:** 15 February 2026
**From:** Designer (SGraph Send team)
**To:** Designer, Architect, Advocate, Ambassador — for collaborative creation
**Purpose:** Create a visual kickoff presentation that walks Cruz & Cruz through the project

---

## 1. What This Presentation Is For

Cruz & Cruz is our first external design agency partner. They need a **visual, engaging walkthrough** of the project — not a document dump. This presentation is the kickoff deck for our first meeting with them.

**Audience:** Designers and project leads at Cruz & Cruz who have no prior context on SGraph Send.

**Goal:** After this presentation, Cruz & Cruz should understand:
- What we're building and why it matters
- Who uses it and what they care about
- What we need from them (logo, brand identity, design system, mockups)
- How we'll work together
- Why this is an exciting project to work on

**Tone:** Professional but energetic. This should feel like an invitation to join something meaningful, not a requirements document reading.

## 2. Presentation Structure

### Slide Deck Outline

The presentation should follow this arc: **Why → What → Who → How → What We Need → Let's Go.**

---

### Section A: The Problem (3-4 slides)

**Slide 1 — Title**
- "SGraph Send — Design Partnership Kickoff"
- Cruz & Cruz logo + SGraph (placeholder mark or text-only for now)
- Date

**Slide 2 — The Problem We Solve**
- Visual: split screen or before/after comparison
- Left: "How people share sensitive files today" — email attachments, WeTransfer, Slack, Google Drive
- Right: "What can go wrong" — data breaches, server-side access, ads and tracking, "the service can read your files"
- Key stat if available: number of data breaches involving file sharing, or a notable example
- Message: **"Every file sharing service today can read your files."**

**Slide 3 — The WeTransfer Comparison**
- Side-by-side comparison: WeTransfer vs SGraph Send
- Visual architecture diagram (simple, not technical):
  - WeTransfer: Your file → their server (they can read it) → recipient
  - SGraph Send: Your file → encrypted in your browser → encrypted blob on server (they can't read it) → recipient decrypts in their browser
- Message: **"We're like WeTransfer, except we literally cannot read your files."**

**Slide 4 — Why This Matters Now**
- Privacy regulations increasing (GDPR, HIPAA)
- Remote work = more file sharing across boundaries
- AI tools processing sensitive documents = new risk surface
- Zero-trust architecture is becoming the standard
- Message: **"Privacy-first file sharing isn't a niche — it's the future."**

---

### Section B: What We've Built (4-5 slides)

**Slide 5 — The Product: SGraph Send**
- Product screenshot or recording of the current MVP (even if rough — show it's real)
- URL: send.sgraph.ai
- One-liner: **"Encrypted file sharing. Zero knowledge. Zero fuss."**

**Slide 6 — How It Works (Visual Flow)**
- A clean, visual diagram of the transfer flow:
  1. Sender drags file → browser encrypts → uploads encrypted blob
  2. Sender gets download link + decryption key
  3. Sender shares link (email) and key (WhatsApp) via separate channels
  4. Receiver opens link → enters key → browser decrypts → file downloaded
- Highlight the key innovation: **"The decryption key never touches our servers."**

**Slide 7 — The Transparency Panel**
- Screenshot or mockup of the transparency panel
- "Here's everything we know about you: your IP address, the timestamp, the file size. That's it."
- Highlight what's NOT stored: file name, file content, decryption key
- Message: **"We don't just promise privacy — we prove it."**

**Slide 8 — The Product Family**
- SGraph-AI portfolio: Send, Image, Text, Billing
- Subdomain structure: send.sgraph.ai, image.sgraph.ai, etc.
- The "S" meanings: Secure, Semantic, Simple, Send, Share
- Message: **"SGraph Send is the first product in a privacy-first platform."**

**Slide 9 — Technology Stack (Brief)**
- Not a deep dive — just enough for designers to understand the constraints
- Zero framework dependencies (vanilla JS, Web Components)
- CSS custom properties for theming (single class change switches themes)
- i18n from day one (all text from translation files, no text in images)
- Client-side encryption (Web Crypto API)
- Message: **"The tech is built for design flexibility from the ground up."**

---

### Section C: Who Uses It (3 slides)

**Slide 10 — User Personas (Overview)**
- Four persona cards with name, role, and key need:
  1. **Privacy-Conscious Professional** — "I need to send contracts securely without thinking about it"
  2. **Tech-Savvy Developer** — "I want transparent, open-source tools I can verify"
  3. **Everyday User** — "I just want to send a big file without ads or sign-ups"
  4. **Enterprise Admin** — "I need visibility into who's using the service"

**Slide 11 — The Key Insight**
- User feedback quote: **"Why are we reinventing WeTransfer?"**
- This is the challenge: the file-sharing utility is immediately clear, but the **differentiation** isn't landing yet
- The design must answer "why not WeTransfer?" in the **first 10 seconds** of the page
- Message: **"Our biggest design challenge: make encryption feel effortless, not scary."**

**Slide 12 — The Big File Sweet Spot**
- User feedback: this becomes really useful for large file transfers (1GB+)
- Pain points by file size:
  - Small (< 30MB): easy via email, Slack — low pain
  - Medium (30MB-1GB): annoying but WeTransfer/Dropbox work
  - Large (1GB+): genuinely painful — limits, failures, no retry
- SGraph Send uses S3 direct upload — no meaningful size limit
- Message: **"The bigger the file, the more the product shines."**

---

### Section D: What We Need (4-5 slides)

**Slide 13 — The Brief Summary**
- Overview of deliverables:
  1. Logo (multi-variant)
  2. Brand identity (colours, typography, visual language)
  3. Website mockups (5 key screens)
  4. Design system (components, tokens, themes)
  5. Multi-theme definitions (5 themes)
- Reference: full written brief provided separately

**Slide 14 — The Logo Challenge**
- Must work from 16x16 favicon to conference presentation
- Must evoke security without being intimidating (no padlocks, no shields)
- Must feel modern, clean, approachable
- Must communicate movement/transfer
- Must work across the product family (SGraph Send, SGraph Image, etc.)
- Show competitor logos for reference: WeTransfer, SendSafely, OnionShare, Signal, Tresorit

**Slide 15 — The Five Themes**
- Visual representation of the three branded themes:
  - **Aurora** — clean, modern default (balanced, professional)
  - **Glacier** — cool, trust-evoking (blues, whites — security positioning)
  - **Ember** — warm, approachable (warmer palette — ease-of-use positioning)
- Plus two accessibility themes:
  - **Dark Mode** — full dark variant
  - **High Contrast** — WCAG AAA, colour-blind friendly
- Message: **"We need a design system, not a single design."**

**Slide 16 — The Five Key Screens**
- Thumbnail wireframes or descriptions of each screen:
  1. Landing page — "What is this?" first impression
  2. Upload flow — encryption in action
  3. Upload complete — link + key + transparency
  4. Download page — receiver experience (also a brand landing page)
  5. Admin console — token management + stats
- Message: **"Each screen tells a different part of the trust story."**

**Slide 17 — Competitive Positioning (Visual)**
- Feature comparison matrix (simplified from the written brief)
- Position SGraph Send in the sweet spot: WeTransfer's beauty + SendSafely's security
- Message: **"Design is our competitive advantage. Security is table stakes."**

---

### Section E: How We Work (2-3 slides)

**Slide 18 — Working Together**
- File sharing: we'll use SGraph Send itself (you become a real user)
- Deliverable formats: Figma preferred, SVG for logos, JSON/CSS for tokens
- Review process: concepts → feedback → refined → mockups → system → handoff
- Our team: Dinis (decisions), Designer (coordination), Architect (tech), Advocate (users), Ambassador (market)
- The AI assistant: you can ask our project-aware bot questions anytime

**Slide 19 — What The Agentic Team Looks Like**
- Brief explanation: this project is built by a multi-agent team (17 roles)
- Each role produces specific outputs
- The design work feeds into Developer, QA, and DevOps roles
- Not a traditional handoff — the design system becomes live code immediately
- Message: **"Your design system becomes code the same week you deliver it."**

**Slide 20 — Timeline & Next Steps**
- Phase 1: Initial concepts (logo + visual direction) — [date TBD]
- Phase 2: Selected direction developed — [date TBD]
- Phase 3: Full mockups — [date TBD]
- Phase 4: Design system + tokens — [date TBD]
- Phase 5: Handoff + implementation support — [date TBD]
- Immediate next step: review the written brief, send questions, schedule concept review

### Section F: Close (1-2 slides)

**Slide 21 — Why This Matters**
- We're building privacy infrastructure that makes encryption invisible
- The design is what makes the difference between "security tool" and "product people love"
- This is an opportunity to define the visual identity of a new product family
- Message: **"Help us make privacy beautiful."**

**Slide 22 — Thank You + Contact**
- Thank you, Cruz & Cruz
- Contact information
- Links: send.sgraph.ai, project repository (if appropriate to share)
- QR code to the product (optional)

## 3. Presentation Format

| Aspect | Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Tool** | Google Slides, Keynote, or Figma presentation (whatever Cruz & Cruz prefers to receive) |
| **Aspect ratio** | 16:9 widescreen |
| **Duration** | 20-25 minutes presentation + 15-20 minutes Q&A |
| **Style** | Minimal text per slide. One idea per slide. Visual-first. |
| **Typography** | Use a clean sans-serif for now (Inter, DM Sans, or similar) — this is pre-brand |
| **Colours** | Use a neutral, professional palette for the deck itself — don't pre-decide the brand colours |
| **Screenshots** | Include real screenshots of the current MVP where possible — shows the product is real |

---

## 4. Visual Assets to Prepare

Before building the deck, gather or create these assets:

| Asset | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Current MVP screenshots | Take from send.sgraph.ai or dev environment | Upload flow, download page, admin console, transparency panel |
| Transfer flow diagram | Create (simplified) | Sender → encrypt → upload → link+key → receiver → decrypt |
| Architecture comparison | Create | WeTransfer (plaintext on server) vs SGraph Send (encrypted blob only) |
| Competitor logos | Public sources | WeTransfer, SendSafely, OnionShare, Signal — for competitive slide |
| Persona illustrations | Stock or placeholder | Four personas as described |
| Theme mood boards | Create or curate | Colour swatches for Aurora, Glacier, Ember |
| Product family diagram | Create | sgraph.ai portfolio tree |

---

## 5. Key Messages to Reinforce Throughout

These messages should be woven through the entire presentation:

1. **"We literally cannot read your files"** — the zero-knowledge value proposition
2. **"Make encryption feel effortless, not scary"** — the core design challenge
3. **"A design system, not a single design"** — multi-theme from day one
4. **"Design is our competitive advantage"** — the technology is strong; the design is what makes people choose us
5. **"The download page is a landing page"** — every receiver is a potential new sender
6. **"Help us make privacy beautiful"** — the inspiring close

## 7. Relationship to Written Brief

This presentation is a **companion** to the written brief (`v0.3.3__brief__cruz-and-cruz-design-agency.md`). The relationship:

- **Presentation** = visual walkthrough for the kickoff meeting (20-25 min)
- **Written brief** = comprehensive reference document they take away and consult
- **Don't duplicate** — the presentation should reference the brief ("full details in the written brief") rather than repeating everything
- **The presentation sells the vision; the brief provides the specifics**

---

*This brief defines the structure and content of the Cruz & Cruz kickoff presentation. The Designer role owns creation, with support from Architect, Advocate, and Ambassador as specified. Target: ready for the first meeting with Cruz & Cruz.*
