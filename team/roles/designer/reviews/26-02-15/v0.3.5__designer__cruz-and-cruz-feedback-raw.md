**Version:** v0.3.5  
**Date:** 15 February 2026  
**From:** Dinis Cruz (verbal debrief, transcribed)  
**Context:** First reactions from Cruz & Cruz design team after reviewing the kickoff presentation (`sgraph-send-kickoff-cruz-and-cruz.pdf`) and written brief (`v0.3.3__brief__cruz-and-cruz-design-agency.md`)

> For the kickoff presentation spec see `v0.3.3__brief__kickoff-presentation-for-cruz-and-cruz.md`. For the written brief see `v0.3.3__brief__cruz-and-cruz-design-agency.md`. For the Designer's analysis of this feedback see `v0.3.5__designer__cruz-and-cruz-feedback-analysis.md`.

## Feedback Items

### CC-F001 — Uncertainty About the Word "Graph"

Cruz & Cruz expressed uncertainty about the word "graph" in the brand name "SGraph". Their concern is that it doesn't communicate clearly to end users — it feels technical and abstract. The word doesn't immediately connect to file sharing, privacy, or security.

**Status:** Noted but parked. The "graph" name is intentional and forward-looking — it references the semantic graph capabilities planned for the SGraph product family (e.g., semantic text graph views of documents). This is not a naming conversation to have now. The design work should proceed with "SGraph Send" as the confirmed product name.

### CC-F002 — "What Is a Blob?"

When the presentation described SGraph Send as storing an "encrypted blob" on the server (slide 3: The Architecture Difference), the designer asked: "What is a blob?" The word is developer jargon that doesn't translate to a design or end-user context. It created momentary confusion rather than building understanding.

The term appears in the written brief as well ("encrypted blobs — useless without the decryption key").

---

### CC-F003 — Interest in the Word "Savvy"

The designer responded positively to the word "savvy" (from the persona "Tech-Savvy Developer" on slide 10). They found it interesting as a potential naming or brand language element — suggesting it could work in messaging, taglines, or feature naming.

**Status:** Noted as a creative signal. Not actionable as a naming change.

---

### CC-F004 — Progress Moments as Trust Education Space

**This is the headline idea from the feedback session.**

The presentation included a slide showing all of SGraph Send's differentiators and trust signals. The designer asked: "Do we need to show all of this to the user at the same time?" Dinis's initial reaction was no — the UI should be simple, focused on sending files, not cluttered with information.

The designer then proposed: **use the upload and download wait times to progressively show this information.** During the moments when the user is staring at a progress indicator — during encryption, upload, and download — the screen real estate can be used to educate the user about what's happening to their data in real time.

Examples of what could be shown during these moments:

- "Right now, we're encrypting your file in your browser..."
- "Your decryption key stays with you — it never touches our server..."
- "Here's what our server will store: encrypted data, file size, timestamp. That's it."
- Links to deeper explanatory pages for users who want to learn more

The concept reframes the design problem from *where* to put trust information (spatial) to *when* to show it (temporal). The UI stays clean because information is delivered in sequence during natural wait states, not packed onto a single page.

### CC-F005 — Corporate Messaging Extension

Building on CC-F004, Dinis extended the idea further: in a B2B or enterprise context, the wait-time space could also display **messages from the token owner** — the organisation or team that provisioned the access token.

Use cases:

- A security team sharing files internally could display security policy reminders during upload/download
- A compliance team could show data handling guidance
- An organisation could brand the experience with their own messaging

This means the person who controls the token (the buyer/admin) could eventually configure messages that appear in the upload/download progress space. It's not an ad — it's contextual messaging from the service provider to their users.

**Implication:** The progress/wait-time component needs to be designed with a **pluggable content slot** from the start, not hardcoded text. The architecture should support this extensibility even if the feature isn't built immediately.

---

### CC-F006 — Cultural Colour Research

Cruz & Cruz responded enthusiastically to the multi-theme concept (slide 15: Five Themes, One Design System). They raised the point that **colours carry different meanings in different cultures**, and this should inform theme design — particularly if SGraph Send targets privacy-aware markets globally.

They also raised the question: **which markets are most privacy-aware?** This would help prioritise which cultural colour associations to research first.

---

### CC-F007 — Theme Rationale as Discoverable Content

Connected to CC-F006, the designer liked the idea of **explaining why each theme was designed the way it was** — the colour choices, the cultural considerations, the accessibility rationale. This could be a link from the theme picker to a dedicated page.

Dinis extended this further: the explanation page could also **invite user feedback** ("Did we get this right for your culture/region?"). This creates an organic engagement loop — users from different markets provide feedback on cultural appropriateness, which improves the product and generates community interaction.

This was described as a "nice, viral, organic way of getting users" — low-cost engagement that also produces useful design research.

## Next Steps

Cruz & Cruz is proceeding with the design work based on the brief and presentation. These feedback items need to be processed by the Designer role and routed to appropriate team roles for action.
