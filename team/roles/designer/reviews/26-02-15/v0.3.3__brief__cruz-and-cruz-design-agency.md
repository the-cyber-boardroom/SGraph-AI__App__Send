# Design Agency Brief: Cruz & Cruz

**Version:** v0.3.3
**Date:** 15 February 2026
**From:** Designer (SGraph Send team)
**To:** Cruz & Cruz — Design Agency
**Supported by:** Architect, Advocate, Ambassador

## 1. Welcome

Thank you for partnering with us. This brief provides everything you need to understand what we're building, who it's for, and what we need from you. We've designed this document to be thorough — take it as a reference, not something you need to memorise. We're available for questions at any time.

---

## 2. What Is SGraph Send?

**SGraph Send** is a **zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing service** at [send.sgraph.ai](https://send.sgraph.ai).

The simplest way to describe it: **it's like WeTransfer, but your files are encrypted in your browser before they ever leave your device.** Our servers never see your content. Even if someone broke into our infrastructure, they'd find nothing but encrypted blobs — useless without the decryption key, which only the sender has.

### How It Works (30-Second Version)

1. **Sender** opens the page, drags a file onto it, clicks "Encrypt & Upload"
2. The file is **encrypted in the browser** using AES-256-GCM (military-grade encryption)
3. The encrypted blob is uploaded to our servers — **we never see the contents**
4. The sender gets two things: a **download link** and a **decryption key**
5. The sender shares these via **separate channels** (e.g. link by email, key by WhatsApp)
6. **Receiver** opens the link, enters the key, and downloads the decrypted file — all in the browser

The key architectural insight: **the server is deliberately blind.** It stores encrypted data, serves it when asked, and has no ability to read it. This is "zero-knowledge" — we literally know nothing about what's been shared.

### Why Not Just Use WeTransfer?

This is the first question every user asks. The answer:

- **WeTransfer can read your files.** They store plaintext on their servers. An employee, a hacker, or a legal request could expose your content.
- **SGraph Send cannot read your files.** Encryption happens before upload. The decryption key never touches our servers. Even under legal compulsion, we have nothing to hand over.
- **We show you everything we capture.** A transparency panel on every page shows exactly what data we have about you — your IP address, the timestamp, the file size. And that's it. No file names. No content. No tracking.

For everyday files, WeTransfer is fine. For anything sensitive — contracts, financial data, medical records, credentials, personal photos — the difference matters.

## 3. The SGraph Brand Family

SGraph Send is the **first product** in the **SGraph-AI product family**:

```
sgraph.ai                    — portfolio home
├── send.sgraph.ai           — encrypted file sharing (this product)
├── image.sgraph.ai          — image processing (planned)
├── text.sgraph.ai           — semantic text generation (planned)
└── billing.sgraph.ai        — usage-based billing (planned)
```

### The Name

**"SGraph"** — the "S" is intentionally multi-valent:

| Meaning | Relevance |
|---------|-----------|
| **Secure** | Zero-knowledge encryption, privacy-first |
| **Semantic** | Knowledge graphs, LLM-driven analysis |
| **Simple** | Minimal, focused, no bloat |
| **Send** | File transfer and sharing |
| **Share** | Collaboration and distribution |

The "Graph" connects to the underlying technology platform (MGraph-AI infrastructure). The combination gives us a unique, uncontested namespace — no SEO competition, no trademark conflicts.

### Brand Values

Every product under `sgraph.ai` shares these values:

| Value | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Zero knowledge** | We cannot see your data. Period. |
| **Radical transparency** | We show you everything we know about you |
| **Ephemeral by default** | Data doesn't linger. Use it and it's gone. |
| **Deploy anywhere** | Open source, self-hostable, no lock-in |
| **Simple over complex** | Core stays minimal. Every feature is a plugin. |
| **Culturally aware** | Multilingual, multi-theme, locally relevant |
| **Cost transparent** | You should know what things cost |

These values are not marketing — they're architectural decisions embedded in the code. **The brand and the product must be the same thing.** The design should communicate these values visually, without needing to explain them with words.

---

## 4. Current State

### What Exists Today

We have a **working end-to-end MVP**. A user can:
1. Open the page
2. Log in with an access token
3. Drag and drop a file
4. Click encrypt
5. Copy the download link
6. Open a new window, paste the link, and download the file

It works. The encryption works. The token system works. The backend works. But the design is purely functional — developer-quality UI with no brand identity, no visual personality, and no trust communication.

### What's Missing

- **Brand identity** — no logo, no defined colours, no typography, no visual language
- **Trust communication** — users don't immediately understand why this is different from WeTransfer
- **First-impression moment** — the landing page doesn't explain what the product is or why they should care
- **Visual design system** — we have CSS variables but no designed themes
- **Accessibility** — no dark mode, no high contrast, no colour-blind considerations

### Technical Foundation

The frontend is built with **vanilla JavaScript and Web Components** — no framework (React, Vue, etc.). This is intentional. The design system needs to work with:

- **CSS custom properties (variables)** for theming — switching a theme is a single CSS class change
- **Web Components** for UI elements — encapsulated, reusable
- **i18n support** — all text comes from translation files (English, Portuguese, more to come)
- **No text baked into images** — all content must be decoupled from design assets

---

## 5. What We Need From You

### 5.1 Logo

We need a logo that works across all scenarios:

| Variant | Use Case | Requirements |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Full colour** | Landing page hero, marketing materials | Primary version |
| **Black and white** | Documents, invoices, monochrome contexts | Must be recognisable without colour |
| **Single colour** | Embossing, engraving, limited palettes | Works in any single colour |
| **High contrast** | Accessibility themes, dark backgrounds | Clear against both light and dark |
| **Icon/mark only** | Favicon (16x16, 32x32), mobile app icon, social profile | Must be recognisable at very small sizes |
| **Full lockup** | Presentations, headers, "SGraph Send" text + mark | Horizontal and stacked variants |
| **Monogram** | Watermarks, subtle branding | The "S" or "SG" as a standalone element |

**Design constraints:**
- Must evoke **security without being intimidating** — no padlocks, no shields, no fortress imagery. Those are fear-based; we want trust-based.
- Must feel **modern, clean, and approachable** — this is a tool for everyone, not just security professionals
- Must communicate **movement or transfer** — this is about sending things
- Must work across the product family — the logo system should accommodate "SGraph Image", "SGraph Text" etc. in the future
- The "Graph" element is optional but interesting — if there's a way to subtly reference graph/node/connection concepts, that adds depth

### 5.2 Brand Identity

| Element | What We Need |
|---------|-------------|
| **Colour palette** | Primary, secondary, accent, and semantic colours (success, error, warning, info). Must work across light, dark, and high-contrast backgrounds. |
| **Typography** | Heading typeface, body typeface, monospace typeface (for keys/codes). Must be web-safe or available via Google Fonts / self-hosted. |
| **Visual language** | Illustration style, icon style, photography direction (if any), use of whitespace, border treatments, shadow conventions. |
| **Tone of voice** | Formal vs casual? Technical vs accessible? Serious vs friendly? We lean toward: **clear, direct, trustworthy, slightly warm.** |
| **Motion/animation** | Subtle transitions, loading states, success/failure animations. What's the visual rhythm? |

### 5.3 Website Mockups

We need mockups for five key screens, each telling a different part of the story:

#### Screen 1: Landing Page — "What Is This?"

This is the most important screen. A first-time visitor lands here and needs to understand:
- **What** this is (file sharing)
- **Why** it's different (zero-knowledge encryption)
- **How** to start (drag a file, enter a token)
- **Why they should trust it** (transparency, open source, no tracking)

The "why not just WeTransfer?" objection must be answered visually in the first 10 seconds — without the user needing to read a paragraph. Think: a simple diagram, a visual comparison, or a single powerful statement.

**Current user feedback:** "What do I do? What is this for?" — the page doesn't explain itself well enough.

#### Screen 2: Upload Flow — Encryption in Action

The drag-and-drop → encrypt → upload flow. This is where trust is built through visible action:
- File selection (drag-and-drop zone)
- Encryption progress ("Encrypting in your browser...")
- Upload progress
- Success state with the two key outputs: download link + decryption key

The encryption step is the magic moment — make it feel real. The user should see and feel that something meaningful is happening to protect their file.

#### Screen 3: Upload Complete — Share Safely

After upload, the user sees:
- The download link (with copy button)
- The decryption key (with copy button)
- Guidance to share via separate channels
- The transparency panel (what we stored)
- Transfer status (downloads, expiry)

This is a dense screen. The hierarchy needs to guide the user through: copy link → copy key → share separately → done.

#### Screen 4: Download Page — Receiver Experience

The receiver arrives via the download link:
- Explanation of what they're about to do
- Key input field
- Download + decrypt button
- Transparency panel (what we capture about them)
- "How it works" explanation

This page is also a **landing page for the brand** — every receiver is a potential new sender. The design should make them want to use this themselves.

#### Screen 5: Admin Console

Token management and usage analytics:
- Create/revoke/list access tokens
- Usage stats (transfers, storage, downloads)
- Per-token activity

This can be more utilitarian, but should still feel cohesive with the brand.

### 5.4 Design System (Not Just Screens)

We need a **design system**, not a set of static mockups. This means:

- **Component library** — buttons, inputs, cards, panels, modals, tooltips, alerts, copy-to-clipboard, progress bars, file drop zones
- **Spacing and grid** — consistent spatial relationships
- **Responsive breakpoints** — mobile-first, tablet, desktop
- **State system** — default, hover, active, disabled, loading, success, error
- **Colour tokens** — named design tokens that map to CSS custom properties

---

## 6. Multi-Theme System

This is critical. We are building for **multiple themes from day one**. The design must work across all variants.

### Three Branded Themes

| Theme | Personality | Colour Direction | Best For |
|-------|------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Aurora** | Clean, modern, confident | Default palette — balanced, professional | General use, first impression |
| **Glacier** | Cool, minimal, trust-evoking | Blues, whites, cool greys — leans into security | Security-conscious users, enterprise |
| **Ember** | Warm, approachable, inviting | Warmer palette — amber, terracotta, warm greys | Casual users, "easy to use" positioning |

### Two Accessibility Themes

| Theme | Purpose | Requirements |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Dark Mode** | Low-light environments, user preference | Full inversion with careful contrast ratios |
| **High Contrast** | Visual impairment, colour-blind users | WCAG AAA contrast ratios, no colour-only information |

### Implementation Approach

All themes are **CSS-variable-based**. Switching a theme is a single class change on `<body>`. Your deliverables should define the colour tokens for each theme:

```
--color-bg, --color-surface, --color-primary, --color-primary-hover,
--color-text, --color-text-secondary, --color-border,
--color-success, --color-error, --color-warning, --color-info
```

We need **full mockups in at least Aurora (default) and Glacier**, with colour token definitions for all five themes.

---

## 7. Accessibility Requirements

This is non-negotiable. The design must be accessible from the start:

| Requirement | Standard | Details |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| Colour contrast | WCAG 2.1 AA (AAA for high-contrast theme) | All text must meet minimum contrast ratios |
| Colour independence | No colour-only information | Status, errors, and states must be indicated by more than colour alone |
| Touch targets | 44x44px minimum | All interactive elements |
| Screen readers | ARIA labels and roles | Semantic HTML, proper heading hierarchy |
| Keyboard navigation | Full keyboard support | Tab order, focus indicators, keyboard shortcuts |
| Reduced motion | `prefers-reduced-motion` support | Animations must respect user preferences |
| Text scaling | Works at 200% zoom | Layout must not break |

---

## 8. Multilingual Considerations

The product supports multiple languages today (English, Portuguese) with more planned. Design implications:

- **Text expansion** — German and Portuguese text can be 30-40% longer than English. Layouts must accommodate this.
- **Right-to-left** — Arabic and Hebrew support is on the roadmap. The layout system should be RTL-ready (use logical properties: `margin-inline-start` not `margin-left`).
- **No text in images** — all text content comes from translation files. Design assets must be language-independent.
- **Cultural sensitivity** — colour meanings vary by culture (red = danger in the West, prosperity in China). The theme system helps here.

---

## 9. Competitive Context

### Where We Sit

| Feature | SGraph Send | WeTransfer | SendSafely | OnionShare |
|---------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Zero-knowledge encryption | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| Transparency panel | Yes | No | No | No |
| Self-hostable | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| No ads | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| Open source | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| Plugin architecture | Yes | No | No | No |
| CLI / SDK | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |
| Product family | Yes | No | No | No |

Our unique position: **the only product combining zero-knowledge encryption with radical transparency, a plugin ecosystem, and membership in a broader product family.**

### Design Positioning

- **WeTransfer** — beautiful but privacy-compromised. Their design is aspirational but their architecture is weak.
- **SendSafely** — secure but enterprise-ugly. Good technology, terrible user experience.
- **OnionShare** — maximum privacy but intimidating. Tor-only, technical users only.

**Our sweet spot: WeTransfer's approachability + SendSafely's security.** Beautiful, simple, trustworthy. The design should make privacy feel effortless, not scary.

## 10. User Personas

### Persona 1: Privacy-Conscious Professional

- Lawyer, journalist, consultant
- Sends sensitive documents regularly
- Currently uses email + "hope for the best"
- Needs: trust signals, professional appearance, clear security explanation
- Friction tolerance: low (if it's harder than email, they won't use it)

### Persona 2: Tech-Savvy Developer

- Shares build artifacts, credentials, API keys
- Comfortable with CLI tools
- Values: transparency, open source, no bloat
- Will read the source code to verify claims
- Needs: developer-friendly design, not "enterprise software" aesthetic

### Persona 3: Everyday User (Friends & Family)

- Shares photos, videos, large files
- Currently uses WhatsApp, WeTransfer, Google Drive
- Doesn't understand encryption and doesn't want to
- Needs: dead-simple UI, clear guidance, zero jargon
- The design must make encryption invisible — it "just works"

### Persona 4: Enterprise Admin

- Manages tokens, monitors usage
- Needs visibility into who's using the service and how much
- Values: dashboard, analytics, control
- Design can be more utilitarian for this persona

## 11. Logistics

### How We'll Work Together

**File sharing:** We'll use SGraph Send itself for sharing design files. This makes you a real user of the product and a source of direct feedback. We'll provide you with access tokens.

### Deliverable Format

| Deliverable | Format | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Logo | SVG (primary) + PNG exports at standard sizes | Vector source files (Figma, Illustrator, or Sketch) |
| Brand identity | PDF brand guidelines document | Colours (hex, RGB, HSL), typography specs, usage rules |
| Website mockups | Figma (preferred) or equivalent | Interactive prototypes welcome |
| Design tokens | JSON or CSS custom properties file | Must map directly to our CSS variable system |
| Icon set | SVG sprite or individual SVGs | Consistent style across all icons |
| Component library | Figma component library | With all states (default, hover, active, disabled, etc.) |

### Review Process

1. **Initial concepts** — 2-3 directions for logo and visual identity
2. **Feedback round** — we review, discuss, select direction
3. **Refined concepts** — selected direction developed further
4. **Mockups** — full page mockups in selected direction
5. **Design system** — component library and design tokens
6. **Handoff** — final assets, tokens, and documentation

### Key Contacts

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| **Dinis Cruz** (Project Lead) | Final decisions, brand direction, approvals |
| **Designer** (our team) | Day-to-day design coordination, feedback |
| **Architect** (our team) | Technical constraints, implementation questions |
| **Advocate** (our team) | User personas, usability feedback |
| **Ambassador** (our team) | Market positioning, competitive context |

### Questions?

You can also talk directly to our project-aware AI assistant, which has full context on the project — the briefs, the architecture, the user personas, the competitive landscape. It can answer factual questions about the project immediately. We'll set this up during the kickoff.

## 12. Summary: What Success Looks Like

After this engagement, we should have:

1. A **logo** that works everywhere — from 16x16 favicons to conference presentations
2. A **brand identity** that communicates trust, simplicity, and modern professionalism
3. **Website mockups** that make zero-knowledge encryption feel effortless and trustworthy
4. A **design system** with components, tokens, and themes that our developers can implement directly
5. **Five theme definitions** (Aurora, Glacier, Ember, Dark, High Contrast) as CSS custom property sets
6. A visual language that answers "why not WeTransfer?" without needing words

The design should make people **want** to use this product — not because they're scared of surveillance, but because it's the obvious, beautiful, simple choice.
