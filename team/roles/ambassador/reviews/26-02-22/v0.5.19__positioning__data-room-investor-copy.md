# Ambassador Positioning: Data Room — Investor Demo Copy

**version** v0.5.19
**date** 22 Feb 2026
**role** Ambassador
**team** Explorer
**type** Positioning — sales copy and differentiation for investor demos

---

## Purpose

Ready-to-use positioning copy for data room investor demos. Two investor groups, two pitch styles, one product truth. All claims are technically defensible (verified against Architect and AppSec documentation).

---

## The One-Liner

> **SG/Send: Secure data rooms your team owns. Zero-knowledge encryption. Costs nothing when idle.**

---

## The 30-Second Pitch

> We build secure data rooms. Files are encrypted in your browser before they ever reach our servers — we literally cannot read your data, even with full infrastructure access. Each data room is a GitHub repo you own: version-controlled, auditable, portable. The compute spins up on demand and shuts down when you're done. An idle data room costs pennies. An active one handles enterprise-grade document exchange at a fraction of what legacy providers charge.

---

## Positioning by Audience

### For Investor Group 1 (Technology-Led)

**They want:** PKI demo, Claude integration, architecture depth.

**Lead with:**

> The foundation is browser-side cryptography — AES-256-GCM for symmetric encryption, ECDH P-256 for key agreement, all via the Web Crypto API with non-extractable private keys. The server never touches plaintext. This isn't a planned feature — it's the architecture. It's been independently validated.
>
> On top of that, we've built PKI: recipient-addressed encryption where you send to a person, not a link. And Claude integration via CLI tool and MCP server — "Claude, send this NDA via SG/Send" works end-to-end.
>
> The data room is where these come together. PKI for access control. Browser encryption for document security. GitHub repo for auditability. Serverless compute for cost efficiency.

**Key slides / demo moments:**
1. Generate a key pair in the browser — show the Web Crypto calls in DevTools
2. Encrypt a document for a specific recipient — show the ECDH key agreement
3. "Claude, send this via SG/Send" — working end-to-end
4. Show their branded data room instance

### For Investor Group 2 (Product-Led)

**They want:** Their own working data room, with their documents in it.

**Lead with:**

> Here's your data room. We built it for this meeting. Your documents are in it. Try it.
>
> You open the link. You enter your key. You see your files. You can download, view, respond. Everything is encrypted — we can't see what you're sharing. When this deal closes, the data room shuts down. When the next deal starts, a new one spins up.
>
> Traditional data rooms cost thousands per month and lock you into a vendor. Ours costs under £50/month active, zero when idle. You own the infrastructure. It's a GitHub repo — auditable, version-controlled, yours.

**Key demo moments:**
1. Open their branded URL — show the professional presentation
2. Navigate the directory — show contacts, files, structure
3. Download and decrypt a document — show the zero-knowledge flow
4. Send a message back — show two-way encrypted communication
5. Show the cost: "This instance, right now, running in EU-West, costs £X/hour"

## Competitive Differentiation Matrix

### SG/Send vs Traditional Data Rooms

| Dimension | Legacy VDRs (Intralinks, Datasite) | Modern VDRs (Digify, iDeals) | SG/Send |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|---------|
| **Encryption** | Server-side (provider sees data) | Server-side (provider sees data) | **Client-side (we never see data)** |
| **Pricing** | £7,500–25,000+ per project | £140–460/month | **£49–999/month; zero when idle** |
| **Infrastructure ownership** | Vendor-hosted, vendor-controlled | Vendor-hosted | **Customer owns repo; self-host option** |
| **Setup time** | Days to weeks | Hours | **Minutes (automated)** |
| **Audit trail** | Proprietary logs | Proprietary logs | **Git history (immutable, open)** |
| **Verification** | Trust the vendor | Trust the vendor | **Open source (verify yourself)** |
| **Lock-in** | High — data in proprietary system | Medium — export possible | **Zero — it's a GitHub repo** |
| **Idle cost** | Full subscription continues | Full subscription continues | **Zero — serverless, scales to zero** |

### The Price Conversation

VDR market pricing in 2026:
- **Enterprise legacy** (Intralinks, Datasite): £7,500–25,000+ per project, often £50K–200K annually
- **Modern mid-market** (iDeals, Firmex): £460–1,250/month
- **Budget** (Digify, FORDATA): £140–350/month
- **SG/Send**: £49–999/month; zero when idle

SG/Send sits below the budget tier on price while exceeding the enterprise tier on security (zero-knowledge encryption, open source, self-hostable). This is the positioning: **enterprise security at startup pricing**.

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|---------|
| "We already use Intralinks/Datasite" | "You're paying £thousands/month for a system where the provider can read your files. We provide stronger encryption at a fraction of the cost. You can run SG/Send alongside your existing VDR — try it for one deal." |
| "Is browser encryption really secure?" | "We use AES-256-GCM via the Web Crypto API — the same cryptographic primitives used by Signal, WhatsApp, and your bank. Our implementation has been independently reviewed by a security professional with 25 years of experience. The code is open source — you can verify it." |
| "We need compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001)" | "Self-hosted SG/Send runs in YOUR infrastructure under YOUR compliance framework. The data room is a GitHub repo — full audit trail, version history, access control. Compliance certification for our managed offering is on the roadmap." |
| "What about large files (1GB+)?" | "Chunked upload with retry and checksum verification is on the roadmap. Current limit is [X]MB per transfer. For the investor demo use case (documents, spreadsheets, presentations), this is more than sufficient." |
| "Can we integrate with our existing tools?" | "SG/Send has a CLI tool (`sg_send`) and MCP server for LLM integration. API access means it integrates with any workflow. We're building this as a platform, not a closed tool." |
| "Who else is using this?" | "Two investor groups are evaluating it for deal document exchange. The product was validated at an industry dinner where multiple finance professionals expressed interest. One stranger on the tube described it as 'Signal for the web.'" |

## Proof Points

These are validated, defensible claims for use in investor conversations:

| Claim | Evidence |
|-------|---------|
| "Zero-knowledge — we never see your data" | Architecture: AES-256-GCM encryption in browser, key never sent to server. Verified by independent review. |
| "Open source" | Apache 2.0 licence, public repo at github.com/SGraph-AI/App-Send |
| "Independently reviewed" | 25-year security veteran: crypto described as "the correct implementation," UX as "foolproof — like Google search" |
| "Enterprise-grade encryption" | AES-256-GCM (NIST approved), ECDH P-256 (NIST approved), Web Crypto API (W3C standard) |
| "Costs nothing when idle" | Serverless architecture (Lambda + S3). No compute costs when not in use. |
| "Self-hostable" | 7 deployment targets: Lambda, Docker, GCP Cloud Run, Fargate, EC2, PyPI, CLI |
| "Full test coverage" | 111+ automated tests, no mocks, in-memory stack, full stack starts in ~100ms |
| "You own the infrastructure" | Data room is a GitHub repo. Customer controls the code, the data, the deployment. |

## Next Steps

| # | Action | Owner |
|---|--------|-------|
| 1 | Prepare branded data room for Investor Group 2 | Dev + DevOps |
| 2 | Create demo script with talking points for each investor group | Ambassador |
| 3 | Draft follow-up email template for post-demo | Ambassador + Journalist |
| 4 | Prepare pricing proposal (tiered: free tier, professional, enterprise) | Ambassador + Alchemist |
