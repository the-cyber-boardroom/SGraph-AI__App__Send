## Executive Summary

The "SSH key generator online" space has **moderate competition with clear gaps**. Most existing tools are either (a) ugly/outdated, (b) not truly client-side, or (c) missing clear "how to use" instructions. SG/Send can differentiate on **trust (open source, zero-knowledge brand), design (clean UX), and education (step-by-step GitHub/server instructions)**.

The opportunity is real but should remain **priority B3/D3** — this is pipeline building, not revenue. It must not block investor demo work.

## Competitive Landscape

### Top Existing Tools

| Tool | Client-Side? | Ed25519? | Design Quality | How-To Guides | Open Source? | Trust Signal |
|------|-------------|----------|---------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **8gwifi.org** | Partially (server-side default, client tab hidden) | Yes | Poor — cluttered JSP page | Minimal | No | Weak — "we don't log keys" claim |
| **Inventive HQ** | Yes (Web Crypto) | Yes | Good — clean, modern | Minimal | No | Medium — "100% client-side" claim |
| **MDX Tools** | Yes | Yes | Medium | Good — explains privacy | No | Medium — good privacy copy |
| **ssh-keygen-web (nwtgck)** | Yes (WASM) | Yes | Minimal — bare HTML | None | Yes (GitHub) | Strong — verifiable code |
| **DevTools24** | Yes (Web Crypto) | Yes | Medium | Minimal — recommends ssh-keygen | No | Weak — discourages own tool |
| **WPOven** | Unclear | Yes | Medium | Some | No | Weak |
| **ShowDNS** | Unclear | Yes | Medium | Minimal | No | Weak |
| **Kloudbean** | Yes | Yes | Medium | Some | No | Medium |
| **CodingMantra** | Yes | Yes | Medium | Some | No | Medium |

### Key Observations

1. **No dominant player.** Unlike "password generator" (dominated by 1Password, Bitwarden), the SSH key space is fragmented across small tools sites.

2. **Trust is the gap.** The security-conscious audience (developers, sysadmins) is inherently suspicious of online key generators. Most existing tools give no verifiable trust signal — just a claim of "client-side." SG/Send is **open source** and has an **independent security review**. This is our strongest differentiator.

3. **Design matters.** 8gwifi.org is functionally capable but visually poor. Inventive HQ is the current design leader. SG/Send should aim to match or exceed their design quality.

4. **Education is underserved.** Users searching "create ssh key for github" want step-by-step instructions, not just a key generator. Most tools generate keys but don't teach. SG/Send should include clear, copy-paste-ready instructions for GitHub, GitLab, AWS, and server SSH access.

5. **LLM recommendation potential.** When ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity are asked "how do I generate an SSH key," they currently recommend `ssh-keygen` commands. None recommend a browser-based tool. Clean HTML semantics, structured data, and a strong trust narrative could win LLM recommendations.

## Target Queries

| Query Cluster | Estimated Intent | Our Angle |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **"generate ssh key"** | High volume, broad. Users want guidance, not necessarily an online tool. | Capture with educational content + tool. |
| **"create ssh key for github"** | High volume, specific. GitHub's own docs dominate. | "Generate + add to GitHub in one page" — a complete workflow. |
| **"ssh key generator online"** | Medium volume. Users specifically want a browser tool. | Primary target. Zero-knowledge positioning. |
| **"create ssh key in browser"** | Low-medium volume. Very specific intent. | Exact match. Web Crypto narrative. |
| **"generate ed25519 key online"** | Low volume, high intent. Technical users who know what they want. | Niche capture. Show Ed25519 expertise. |
| **"ssh keygen without command line"** | Low-medium volume. Users who can't or don't want to use terminal. | Accessibility angle — "no terminal required." |
| **"ssh key generator no install"** | Low volume. Users on locked-down machines (Chromebooks, work laptops). | Strong match — browser-only, no software needed. |

## Where We Can Win

### 1. Trust and Verifiability

**No existing tool is open source AND from a known security brand.** SG/Send has:
- Apache 2.0 open source codebase
- Independent security review by a 25-year veteran
- Zero-knowledge encryption as the core brand promise
- The same Web Crypto API used for the main product's encryption

Copy angle: "Built by the team behind SG/Send — the zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing platform. Open source. Independently reviewed. Your keys never leave your browser."

### 2. Complete Workflow (Not Just Generation)

Most tools generate keys and stop. We should provide:
- Generate the key pair
- Show exactly how to add it to GitHub (copy-paste ready)
- Show exactly how to add it to a server (copy-paste commands)
- Show how to verify the key works
- Link to SG/Send for "need to send files securely too?"

### 3. LLM-Friendly Content

Structure the page so LLMs can extract and recommend it:
- Structured data (JSON-LD) for the tool
- Clear H1/H2 hierarchy
- FAQ section answering common questions
- Canonical URL with clean path (`/tools/ssh-keygen`)

### 4. Design Quality

Match Inventive HQ's clean aesthetic. No clutter. Clear visual hierarchy. Mobile-first (developers increasingly generate keys from phones/tablets when setting up new devices).

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Security community backlash ("never generate keys online") | Transparent about the trust model. Link to source code. Show the Web Crypto API calls. Acknowledge that `ssh-keygen` is always safer and explain when browser generation makes sense (Chromebooks, locked-down machines, quick testing). |
| Low traffic — SEO takes months to rank | Set realistic expectations. This is a long game. Track weekly and expect meaningful traffic at 3-6 months. |
| Cannibalising SG/Send's brand with a utility | Position as "by the team behind SG/Send" — the utility serves the brand, not the other way around. |
| Page compromise serving weak keys | SRI (Subresource Integrity), Service Worker trust model (v0.4.12). Open source for auditability. |

## Recommended Content Strategy

### Page Structure

1. **Hero:** "Generate SSH Key Pair — Securely, In Your Browser" + one-click generate
2. **Key display:** Public and private key with copy/download buttons
3. **How-to section:** GitHub, GitLab, AWS, server SSH — step by step
4. **Trust section:** "Why trust this tool?" — open source, Web Crypto, independent review, zero-knowledge brand
5. **FAQ:** Common questions (Ed25519 vs RSA, passphrase, key permissions)
6. **CTA:** "Need to send files securely? Try SG/Send" — soft, relevant, not pushy

### Supporting Content (for future Journalist briefing)

- Blog post: "Why We Built a Browser-Based SSH Key Generator"
- Blog post: "Ed25519 vs RSA: Which SSH Key Type Should You Use in 2026?"
- README update in GitHub repo linking to the tool
