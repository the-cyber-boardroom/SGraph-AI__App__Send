**type** Framework — measurement and metrics definition

## Purpose

This is the measurement framework for SG/Send's first marketing campaign: the SSH key generator utility page. Every campaign needs defined metrics before launch (Ambassador Quality Gate). This document defines what to measure, how, and what success looks like.

---

## Metrics Architecture

### Principle: Zero User Tracking

SG/Send is a zero-knowledge product. The marketing page must reflect this. No cookies. No user fingerprinting. No session tracking. No third-party analytics scripts.

What we CAN measure:
- Anonymous page view counts (server-side, no identifying data)
- Click events (client-side, aggregated, no user data)
- Search ranking position (external tool, no user interaction)
- Referral source domain (HTTP Referer header, aggregated)

What we WILL NOT measure:
- Individual user journeys
- User demographics
- Session duration (requires tracking)
- Return visits (requires cookies)

## Metrics Definition

### Tier 1: Reach (Are People Finding Us?)

| Metric | Definition | Collection Method | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Page views** | Total HTTP requests to `/tools/ssh-keygen` | Server-side counter (Lambda logs, aggregated daily) | Daily |
| **Search ranking** | Position for target queries in Google | Manual check or free rank tracker (e.g., SERPWatcher free tier) | Weekly |
| **Referral domains** | Which domains are sending traffic | HTTP Referer header, aggregated by domain (no full URLs) | Weekly |
| **Backlinks** | External sites linking to the page | Free backlink checker (Ahrefs free, Google Search Console) | Monthly |

### Tier 2: Engagement (Are People Using the Tool?)

| Metric | Definition | Collection Method | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Key generations** | Number of times "Generate" button clicked | Client-side counter, sent as anonymous aggregate to server | Daily |
| **Algorithm preference** | Which key type users select (Ed25519 / RSA / ECDSA) | Aggregate counts per algorithm, no user association | Weekly |
| **Copy/download actions** | Public key copied, private key downloaded | Aggregate counts per action type | Weekly |

### Tier 3: Conversion (Are People Discovering SG/Send?)

| Metric | Definition | Collection Method | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **CTA clicks** | Clicks on "Try SG/Send" link | Outbound link counter (client-side, aggregated) | Daily |
| **Referral to main site** | Visits to `send.sgraph.ai` with Referer = ssh-keygen page | Server-side, main site Lambda logs | Weekly |
| **SG/Send transfers from referrals** | Transfers initiated by users who came from the utility page | Server-side correlation (referer domain only, no user tracking) | Monthly |

### Tier 4: Amplification (Is It Spreading?)

| Metric | Definition | Collection Method | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Social mentions** | Mentions of the tool on Twitter/X, Reddit, HN, LinkedIn | Manual monitoring + Google Alerts | Weekly |
| **GitHub stars delta** | Change in repo stars following launch | GitHub API | Weekly |
| **LLM recommendations** | Whether ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity recommend our tool | Manual testing of prompts | Bi-weekly |

---

## Baselines and Targets

### Pre-Launch Baselines (to be recorded at launch)

| Metric | Current Baseline |
|--------|-----------------|
| Daily page views to send.sgraph.ai | TBD (record at launch) |
| GitHub stars | TBD (record at launch) |
| Google ranking for "ssh key generator online" | Not ranked |
| Google ranking for "generate ssh key in browser" | Not ranked |
| LLM recommendation for "generate ssh key" | Not recommended |

### 30-Day Targets (Post-Launch)

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Page views | 100+ total | Modest for a new page with no existing traffic. Success = any organic discovery. |
| Key generations | 50+ | ~50% of visitors use the tool (reasonable for a utility page). |
| CTA clicks to SG/Send | 10+ | ~10% of generators click through. This is the conversion signal. |
| Google ranking (target queries) | Top 50 for at least one query | SEO takes months. Top 50 at 30 days = positive trajectory. |

### 90-Day Targets (Revised at 30-Day Review)

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Page views | 500+/month | Growing organic traffic as SEO takes hold. |
| Google ranking | Top 20 for "ssh key generator online" | Realistic for a quality page with backlinks. |
| LLM recommendations | Mentioned by at least one major LLM | Structured data + clean content should get picked up. |
| Backlinks | 5+ external domains | From developer tool lists, blog posts, social shares. |

## Implementation: Anonymous Analytics

### Approach: Server-Side Counters

No third-party analytics. No JavaScript tracking libraries. Anonymous, server-side counters.

```
Event Flow:
1. Page loads → Lambda serves static HTML (counted as page view)
2. User clicks "Generate" → client JS sends POST /tools/ssh-keygen/events
   Body: { "event": "generate", "algorithm": "ed25519" }
   No user ID. No cookies. No IP logging (IP is hashed with daily salt per existing pattern).
3. User clicks "Try SG/Send" → client JS sends POST /tools/ssh-keygen/events
   Body: { "event": "cta_click" }
4. Lambda aggregates events into daily counters in Memory-FS
```

### Data Model

```json
{
  "date": "2026-02-22",
  "page_views": 47,
  "generations": {
    "ed25519": 28,
    "rsa_4096": 11,
    "ecdsa_p256": 3
  },
  "actions": {
    "copy_public": 35,
    "copy_private": 22,
    "download_public": 12,
    "download_private": 18
  },
  "cta_clicks": 5,
  "referrers": {
    "google.com": 22,
    "duckduckgo.com": 8,
    "direct": 12,
    "github.com": 5
  }
}
```

### DPO Review Required

Before implementing analytics:
- Confirm aggregated event counting is compatible with PECR (no cookies, no tracking)
- Confirm IP hash with daily salt meets data minimisation requirements
- Confirm Referer domain aggregation is acceptable (no full URLs stored)

## Reporting Cadence

| When | What | Who |
|------|------|-----|
| **Launch day** | Record all baselines. First page view count. | Ambassador |
| **Weekly (first 30 days)** | Page views, generations, rankings, social mentions | Ambassador |
| **30-day review** | Full metrics report. Assess against targets. Revise 90-day targets. | Ambassador + Conductor |
| **90-day review** | Campaign post-mortem. ROI assessment. Decision: continue, expand, or sunset. | Ambassador + Conductor |

---

## Success Criteria

**The campaign is a success if:**

1. The page ranks in Google's top 50 for at least one target query within 30 days
2. At least 10 users click through to the main SG/Send site within 30 days
3. The page is mentioned by at least one LLM when asked about SSH key generation within 90 days
4. No security incidents or reputational damage from the utility

**The campaign should be re-evaluated if:**

1. Zero organic traffic after 30 days (page not being discovered)
2. High bounce rate (users arrive but don't generate keys) — indicates UX or trust problem
3. Negative community feedback (e.g., "don't trust browser-based generators")
