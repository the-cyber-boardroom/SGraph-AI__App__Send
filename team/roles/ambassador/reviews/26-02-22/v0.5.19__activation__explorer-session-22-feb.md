## Context Since Last Session (21 Feb)

### What Changed

| Change | Impact on Ambassador |
|--------|---------------------|
| **v0.5.15 dev brief: PKI-keyed personal data vault** | New product surface. Storage keyed to public key hash. Extends "send to someone" into "save for yourself." Positioning implications: SG/Send is now a platform, not just a transfer tool. |
| **Villager perf fix (v0.5.13 debrief)** | Admin UI page load now 224ms. Performance is no longer a blocker for demos. Middleware__Analytics disabled — means we have no usage metrics until redesigned. |
| **Version now v0.5.19** | Significant progress since v0.5.13. Multiple PKI and architecture advances. |

### Outstanding Action Items (from 21 Feb review)

| # | Action Item | Status |
|---|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Research target SEO queries for SSH key utility | **This session** |
| 2 | Define measurement framework for first marketing campaign | **This session** |

## Current Ambassador Priority Table

## Strategic Assessment

### The Product Has Evolved

Between v0.5.13 (last Ambassador session) and v0.5.19, SG/Send has moved from "encrypted file transfer" to "encrypted workflow platform." The product surface now includes:

1. **File transfer** (working, deployed) — the original product
2. **Data rooms** (product brief ready) — the revenue product
3. **PKI key management** (working) — the trust infrastructure
4. **Personal data vault** (v0.5.15 brief) — the retention hook
5. **Browser pod** (architecture brief) — the client platform
6. **Agent meeting room** (team site brief) — the community/marketing surface

This is a **platform narrative**, not a single-product pitch. The Ambassador's positioning needs to reflect this evolution while keeping the "what it does in 10 seconds" message crisp.

### The 10-Second Pitch (Updated)

Previous: "SG/Send: encrypted file sharing. The server never sees your data."

Proposed update: "SG/Send: secure data rooms your team owns. Zero-knowledge encryption. Infrastructure that costs nothing when idle."

The shift: from **utility** (send a file) to **workspace** (collaborate securely).

### Two Investor Groups — Two Different Pitches

| Group | What They Want | Our Pitch |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **Group 1** (v0.4.12) | PKI demo, Claude integration, architecture depth | Technology-led: "Here's the crypto, here's the AI integration, here's the architecture." |
| **Group 2** (v0.5.10) | Their own data room, working, with their documents | Product-led: "Here's YOUR data room. Your documents are in it. Try it." |

Group 2 is the stronger sales opportunity because we're selling the product BY USING the product. The demo IS the deliverable.

## Session Plan

This session will produce:

1. **SEO research for SSH key utility** — competitive landscape, target queries, gap analysis
2. **Measurement framework** — what to track, how, and what success looks like
3. **Data room positioning copy** — for investor demos
4. **Team site content strategy** — which agents, what content, how to structure
