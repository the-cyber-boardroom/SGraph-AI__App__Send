## Purpose

Content strategy for `team.send.sgraph.ai` — the public agent meeting room. This site is simultaneously a daily tool for the human, a marketing asset, and an open-source community hub. This document defines what content goes where, which agents to highlight, and how to structure the visitor experience.

---

## Three Audiences, One Site

| Audience | What They Want | Entry Point | Conversion Goal |
|----------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Potential customers** (investors, finance, legal) | Understand the product, security model, pricing | Ambassador, AppSec, Architect | Book a demo, try SG/Send |
| **Developers / open-source contributors** | Understand the architecture, find where to contribute | Developer, Architect, DevOps | Star the repo, submit a PR |
| **The human (Dinis)** | Talk to agents, get status updates, coordinate work | Any agent | Daily productivity tool |

---

## Agent Grid: Recommended Layout

### Tier 1: Hero Row (Most Valuable for External Visitors)

These four agents should be visually prominent — larger cards, first row.

| Agent | One-Line Description | Why Hero |
|-------|---------------------|----------|
| **Architect** | "System design, encryption, and infrastructure" | The architecture IS the product. Visitors who understand the crypto become believers. |
| **AppSec** | "Security model, threat analysis, and trust" | For a zero-knowledge product, security credibility is the sale. |
| **Ambassador** | "Product positioning, pricing, and market fit" | The business-facing agent. Answers "why SG/Send?" and "how much?" |
| **Developer** | "Code, builds, APIs, and contribution guide" | The entry point for open-source contributors. |

### Tier 2: Supporting Row

| Agent | One-Line Description | Primary Audience |
|-------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Sherpa** | "Getting started, onboarding, and first steps" | New users who need guidance |
| **DevOps** | "Deployment, infrastructure, and operations" | Technical evaluators, self-hosting prospects |
| **Journalist** | "News, updates, and what's changed" | Anyone wanting the latest |
| **Conductor** | "Priorities, roadmap, and what's next" | Product evaluators, contributors |

### Tier 3: Full Grid (All 19 Agents)

All remaining agents visible in a compact grid below the hero and supporting rows:

Librarian, Historian, Cartographer, Designer, Advocate, GRC, CISO, DPO, Alchemist, QA, Accountant

These serve specific queries ("what's the compliance posture?" → GRC/DPO, "what's the brand direction?" → Designer) but are not primary entry points.

---

## Content Per Agent

Each agent page needs three layers of content:

### Layer 1: Static Context (Loaded from context.md)

Pre-written by the Librarian, stored in GitHub Pages, fetched at runtime.

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Role summary** | 2-3 sentences. What this agent does. |
| **Current focus** | What the agent is working on right now (updated with each version). |
| **Recent work** | Bullet list of the last 3-5 deliverables with version numbers. |
| **Key documents** | Links to the most important reviews/specs this agent has produced. |

### Layer 2: Conversation (LLM-Powered)

The visitor asks questions, the agent answers using its role knowledge + project context.

**System prompt structure for each agent:**
```
You are the {role} for SG/Send, a zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing
and data room platform.

Your role: {role description from ROLE.md}
Current version: {version}
Current focus: {from context.md}

You have access to:
- Your role definition (ROLE.md)
- Recent reviews and deliverables
- Project architecture and specs
- Current priorities and roadmap

Answer questions honestly. If you don't know something, say so.
If the question is outside your role, suggest which agent to talk to.
```

### Layer 3: Featured Conversations (Curated by Journalist)

Pre-curated example conversations that demonstrate the agent's capabilities:

| Agent | Featured Conversation |
|-------|----------------------|
| Architect | "Explain the zero-knowledge encryption model" |
| AppSec | "What's the threat model for a compromised server?" |
| Ambassador | "How does SG/Send compare to Intralinks?" |
| Developer | "I want to contribute — where do I start?" |
| Sherpa | "How do I send my first encrypted file?" |

These serve as:
- Demo content for visitors who don't want to chat
- SEO-friendly content (indexable, keyword-rich)
- Quality examples showing how the agents think

## SEO and Discoverability

### Target Queries for Team Site

| Query | Target Page | Strategy |
|-------|------------|----------|
| "sg/send security" | AppSec agent page | Featured conversation about the threat model |
| "zero-knowledge file sharing architecture" | Architect agent page | Technical deep-dive content |
| "contribute to sg/send" | Developer agent page | Open-source contributor guide |
| "ai agent team workflow" | Home page or Conductor page | The agentic workflow as a content piece |
| "secure data room comparison" | Ambassador agent page | Competitive positioning content |

### LLM Discoverability

The team site itself is a demonstration of agentic workflow. When LLMs are asked about "AI agent teams" or "running AI agents in production," the site should be discoverable.

Structure for LLM-friendliness:
- Clean semantic HTML (H1 = agent name, H2 = sections)
- JSON-LD structured data for each agent (Person/SoftwareApplication schema)
- sitemap.xml listing all agent pages
- robots.txt allowing full crawl

---

## Shareable Links Strategy

The primary Ambassador use case is sharing specific agent links:

| Context | Link | Use Case |
|---------|------|----------|
| Investor meeting prep | `team.send.sgraph.ai/appsec` | "Read about our security model before the meeting" |
| Conference networking | `team.send.sgraph.ai/architect` | "Talk to our Architect about the encryption" |
| Open source outreach | `team.send.sgraph.ai/developer` | "Want to contribute? Talk to our Dev agent" |
| Support | `team.send.sgraph.ai/sherpa` | "Need help getting started? Talk to our Sherpa" |
| Business enquiries | `team.send.sgraph.ai/ambassador` | "Questions about pricing or partnerships?" |

Each shareable link should:
- Work immediately (no login, no setup)
- Show the agent's context and recent work before requiring interaction
- Have Open Graph tags for social media preview (agent name, role, SG/Send branding)

---

## Metrics for Team Site

| Metric | Target (30-day) | Collection |
|--------|-----------------|------------|
| Unique agent pages visited | Track which agents get the most traffic | Server-side counters |
| Conversations started | How many visitors actually chat | Client-side aggregate counter |
| Most-asked questions | What are visitors asking about? | Aggregate topic classification (no raw questions stored) |
| Referral to SG/Send main site | Clicks on "Try SG/Send" | Outbound link counter |
| GitHub stars delta post-launch | Impact on repo popularity | GitHub API |

## Integration with Ambassador Workflows

### Conference Prep Workflow

1. Before a conference, Ambassador reviews which agents to highlight
2. Journalist prepares featured conversations relevant to the audience
3. Ambassador creates a custom landing page or "conference mode" with curated agent order
4. Post-conference, track which agent links were shared and follow up

### Investor Demo Workflow

1. Before investor meeting, prepare agent context with latest relevant deliverables
2. During demo, live-chat with Architect and AppSec to demonstrate depth
3. Share `team.send.sgraph.ai/ambassador` link in follow-up email
4. Track whether investors return to the site

### Open Source Growth Workflow

1. Developer agent context updated with current "help wanted" items
2. Ambassador submits to developer community sites (Hacker News, Dev.to, r/programming)
3. Journalist writes "Meet our 19 AI Agents" blog post
4. Track contributor onboarding via Developer agent conversations
