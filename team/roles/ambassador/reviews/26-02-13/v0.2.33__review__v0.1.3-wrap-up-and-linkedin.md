# v0.2.33 -- Ambassador Review: v0.1.3 Wrap-Up and LinkedIn Strategy

**Version:** v0.2.33
**Date:** 13 February 2026
**Role:** Ambassador
**Context:** Response to [v0.1.3 Session Wrap-Up Debrief](../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/debriefs/02/13/v0.2.33__debrief__v0.1.3-wrap-up.md)
**First review:** This is the Ambassador's inaugural document for SGraph Send.

---

## Executive Summary

The v0.1.3 session shipped three UI versions, removed Google Analytics, established a zero-cookie policy, delivered i18n in four languages (including Klingon), and culminated in a LinkedIn post that is SGraph Send's first public product showcase. This review analyses the external positioning implications, evaluates the LinkedIn post strategy, and sets out a growth plan for the coming weeks.

The central finding: SGraph Send now has a genuinely differentiated market position -- zero cookies, zero knowledge, zero tracking, multilingual from day one -- and the LinkedIn Klingon post is an effective opening move to make that position visible. The task now is to build a sustained external narrative, not just a single viral moment.

---

## 1. LinkedIn Post Strategy

### 1.1 The Post

> "Anybody here speaks Klingon? The latest MVP of the SGraph Send service is now available in: English, Portugues (Brasil), Portugues (Portugal), tlhIngan Hol"

Post URL: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7428147910451638272/

Accompanied by screenshots showing the product UI in all four languages with the flag-based language selector.

### 1.2 Competitive Positioning Analysis

**What this post communicates versus competitors:**

| Signal | What It Says | Competitor Comparison |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Klingon as a language option** | "Our i18n architecture is so robust it handles constructed languages. If it works for Klingon, it works for any real language." | WeTransfer, Dropbox Transfer, and every major competitor have no multilingual support or limited localisation. None would ship Klingon. |
| **Portuguese (Brasil) AND Portuguese (Portugal)** | "We handle regional variants, not just languages. We respect linguistic identity." | Most services that offer Portuguese offer one variant. Offering both signals attention to detail and genuine international readiness. |
| **Screenshots of real product** | "This is not a mockup. This is live." | Many startups at MVP stage show mockups or renders. Showing the actual product in four languages demonstrates velocity and seriousness. |
| **Playful tone** | "We are serious about security but not humourless about it." | The encrypted file sharing space is dominated by grim, paranoid messaging. A product that can joke about Klingon while delivering AES-256-GCM encryption stands out. |
| **"MVP" label used openly** | "We are building in public and inviting you to watch." | Signals authenticity. The audience is being invited into the journey, not sold a finished product. |

**Net positioning effect:** SGraph Send appears technically competent (real i18n, regional variants), culturally aware (Brazilian vs. European Portuguese), approachable (Klingon humour), and transparent (MVP label, real screenshots). This is a strong first impression for a privacy product -- it establishes trust through openness rather than through severity.

### 1.3 Community Engagement Strategy -- Leveraging Klingon

The Klingon angle is not a gimmick. It is a deliberate community engagement vector with several properties:

**Conversation starter.** Klingon is inherently shareable. People comment, tag friends, and share posts about Klingon. The post is designed to generate engagement through novelty, not through asking for it. This is organic reach at its best.

**Proof of architecture.** For technical audiences, Klingon proves that the i18n system is genuinely language-agnostic. If your architecture handles a language with no native speakers and a non-Latin script philosophy, it handles everything. This is a more convincing demonstration than saying "we support 12 languages" -- because anyone can claim that, but shipping Klingon proves the system works at a structural level.

**Community identification.** The Klingon-speaking community (Klingon Language Institute, trekkies, constructed-language enthusiasts) is a tight-knit, vocal, and digitally active group. They share products that take their language seriously. A Klingon translation of a real product is rare enough to be noteworthy within that community.

**Engagement tactics for follow-up:**

1. **Respond to every comment on the LinkedIn post.** Especially comments from people tagging friends or asking about Klingon. Each response extends the post's algorithmic reach.
2. **If anyone provides a Klingon correction, incorporate it publicly.** "Thanks for the correction -- we've updated the translation. Community-driven localisation in action." This turns a correction into a story about open collaboration.
3. **Cross-post the Klingon angle to Reddit** -- r/startrek, r/conlangs, r/klingon. These communities are the natural amplifiers. Keep the tone authentic: "We built a zero-knowledge file sharing service and added Klingon because our i18n architecture supports any language."
4. **Tag or message the Klingon Language Institute** (kli.org). If they notice and share, the reach multiplies into a community that talks to journalists and podcasters.

### 1.4 Follow-Up Campaign Recommendations

The LinkedIn Klingon post is the opening volley. The next 4-6 weeks should tell a sequence of stories, each building on the last. The principle: **each post should be independently interesting, but together they build a narrative of a product being built in public with integrity.**

**Post #2 (within 3-5 days): "The Zero-Cookie Story"**

> "We removed Google Analytics from SGraph Send. Not because we found a better analytics tool -- but because third-party tracking has no place in a zero-knowledge product. Our site now uses zero cookies. No banner. No consent popup. No tracking. You can verify it yourself: open dev tools, check cookies. Empty."

Why this works: It follows the Klingon post's energy (surprising, concrete, verifiable) but shifts to the privacy narrative. Anyone who engaged with the Klingon post now sees the substance behind the personality.

**Post #3 (week 2): "The IFD Story" -- Building in Public**

> "We shipped three UI versions this week. Each one is still live at its own URL. We never overwrite. We never lose a working version. It's called Iterative Flow Development -- every change creates a new version, every previous version is preserved. Here's v0.1.0 through v0.1.3 side by side."

Why this works: Developers and product managers care about methodology. IFD is unusual and interesting. Showing four live URLs with four different versions of the same product is visually compelling and practically verifiable.

**Post #4 (week 2-3): "The Agentic Team Story"**

> "This product was designed by a team of 12 AI agents, each with a defined role -- architect, security reviewer, quality engineer, journalist, user advocate. 22 responses to two daily briefs. Real architectural decisions. Real code shipped. Here's how an agentic team builds a real product."

Why this works: The AI-building-products narrative is trending but rarely backed by concrete evidence. SGraph Send has the receipts: 22 role responses, 20 decisions, 4,573 lines of code, 3 shipped versions, all in one session. This is not "AI generated some code" -- it is "an AI team operated like a real engineering organisation."

**Post #5 (week 3-4): "The First User Story"**

> "Our first user tested SGraph Send and said: 'This is quite useful, this is cool.' They also got stuck on three things. Here's what we fixed in 48 hours."

Why this works: Authenticity. Sharing real user feedback (positive and negative) and the speed of response builds credibility. It also demonstrates the build-in-public philosophy.

**Post #6 (week 4+): "Human-Friendly Tokens"**

> "We're inviting communities to SGraph Send with tokens like 'security-meetup' and 'privacy-advocates' -- not GUIDs. Your community gets 1,000 encrypted transfers. No account needed. No cookies. Just a memorable token and a link."

Why this works: It transitions from awareness to acquisition. The token system becomes the bridge between content marketing and user growth.

### 1.5 Partnership Opportunities

The Klingon post and the broader privacy positioning open several partnership channels:

| Partner Type | Opportunity | Approach |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Klingon Language Institute** (kli.org) | Cross-promotion. They promote products that take Klingon seriously. | Send them a community token ("klingon-institute"). Ask if they would review the translation accuracy. |
| **Constructed language communities** (Esperanto, Toki Pona, Lojban) | Community tokens for each language community, with an invitation to contribute translations. | "We built an i18n architecture that supports any language. Want to add yours?" |
| **Privacy advocacy organisations** (EFF, Privacy International, noyb) | Our zero-cookie, zero-knowledge, zero-tracking posture aligns directly with their mission. | Share the product with their communications teams. Not asking for endorsement -- asking for feedback. "We built this. Does it meet your bar?" |
| **Developer communities** (Hacker News, dev.to, IndieHackers) | The IFD methodology, the agentic team structure, and the zero-dependency frontend are all stories developers care about. | Technical blog posts, not marketing. "Here's how we built multilingual support with zero framework dependencies." |
| **Accessibility advocates** | High-contrast and dark mode themes (planned in v0.1.4+) plus multilingual support position us as accessibility-conscious. | Once themes ship, reach out to accessibility-focused communities and reviewers. |
| **InfoSec community** | Zero-knowledge encryption, no server-side plaintext, hash-fragment key distribution -- these are architecturally interesting claims that security researchers enjoy verifying. | Publish the security architecture publicly. Invite review. "Here's how we do it. Tell us if we're wrong." |

## 2. Market Differentiation Update

### 2.1 The Triple-Zero Position

The v0.1.3 session establishes a market position that no competitor currently occupies:

**Zero cookies + Zero knowledge + Multilingual = The Privacy-First Global File Sharing Service**

This is not an incremental improvement over competitors. It is a category position. Let me map it:

| Dimension | SGraph Send | WeTransfer | Dropbox Transfer | Tresorit Send |
|-----------|------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Cookies | Zero | Yes (GA, marketing, session) | Yes (extensive) | Yes (session, analytics) |
| Server sees plaintext | No | Yes | Yes | No (E2E) |
| Third-party tracking | None | Google Analytics + others | Google Analytics + others | Limited |
| Multilingual UI | 4 languages (day 1) | Limited localisation | Limited localisation | ~10 languages |
| Cookie banner | None needed | Required | Required | Required |
| Account required | No | No (free tier) | Yes | Yes |
| Open verification | Yes (dev tools) | No | No | Partial (audit reports) |

**The unique claim:** "SGraph Send is the only encrypted file sharing service with zero cookies, zero third-party tracking, zero server-side plaintext, and multilingual support -- and you can verify every one of those claims in your browser's developer tools."

No other product can make all four claims simultaneously. Tresorit comes closest (E2E encryption) but still uses cookies and requires accounts. Firefox Send had the right architecture but was discontinued. SGraph Send occupies the position Firefox Send vacated, with improvements.

**Caveat:** The competitive comparison table from the Journalist's review (Section 2) requires fact-checking before external publication. The structure is correct; the specific claims about each competitor's cookie and tracking behaviour must be verified. I recommend a focused research session to confirm each cell before we publish any competitive comparison externally.

### 2.2 The IFD Story for Developer Audiences

The Iterative Flow Development methodology is a genuine differentiator for developer-audience storytelling. Here is why:

**The problem IFD solves is universal.** Every developer has experienced: "We shipped a UI update and broke the previous version." IFD makes this impossible. Every version lives at its own URL. Rollback is instant. Previous versions are never touched.

**The implementation is verifiable.** Anyone can visit v0.1.0, v0.1.1, v0.1.2, and v0.1.3 -- all live, all independently accessible. This is not a methodology described in a blog post; it is a methodology demonstrated in a running product.

**The zero-dependency angle is compelling.** Vanilla JS, Web Components, no React, no Vue, no build step. In an ecosystem drowning in framework churn, a product built with browser-native technologies is contrarian and interesting. Developers who are tired of framework fatigue will find this refreshing.

**The developer audience content strategy:**

1. **Technical blog post:** "How we built multilingual support for 4 languages with zero framework dependencies." Walk through the i18n.js implementation, the JSON locale files, the event-driven component re-rendering. Show the actual code. Developers respect specificity.
2. **Conference talk pitch:** "Iterative Flow Development: Never Break a Working UI Again." Target frontend conferences and meetups. The concept is general enough to apply beyond SGraph Send but specific enough to be a real case study.
3. **Open-source the i18n module.** If the i18n approach is truly framework-agnostic and dependency-free, it has standalone value. Open-sourcing it creates a developer touch point: "Made by the team behind SGraph Send."

### 2.3 The Agentic Team Story

**22 AI role responses building a real product. Is this worth telling?**

Yes. Unequivocally yes. But the story must be told carefully.

**Why it is worth telling:**

- The AI-as-team narrative is trending but mostly theoretical. SGraph Send has concrete evidence: 10 defined roles, 22 responses to 2 daily briefs, 20 architectural decisions logged, 3 UI versions shipped, 4,573 lines of code written, 7 bugs fixed, 13 friction points identified -- all in a single session.
- The structure is novel. This is not "I used ChatGPT to write some code." This is an agentic team with defined roles, responsibilities, handoffs, and deliverables, operating like a real engineering organisation with a human project lead providing briefs and making decisions.
- The deliverables are public (or can be made public). The role reviews, decision logs, debrief documents -- these are auditable evidence of how the team operates.

**How to tell it without alienating:**

- **Lead with the product, not the AI.** "We shipped three UI versions in four languages this week. Here's how." Then reveal the team structure. The product quality establishes credibility; the AI origin is the surprise.
- **Be specific, not hype-driven.** "22 role responses" is more credible than "AI-powered development." Numbers and artifacts are convincing; labels are not.
- **Acknowledge the human.** The human project lead writes the briefs, makes the decisions, ships the code, and does the final quality check. The agentic team is not replacing humans -- it is amplifying a human's capacity to build.
- **Target the right audiences.** The agentic team story resonates with: AI/ML practitioners, engineering leaders exploring AI-augmented workflows, startup founders who need to move fast with small teams, and journalists covering AI in practice.

**Risk:** Some audiences will dismiss the product if they learn it was "built by AI." Mitigate this by always leading with the product quality and the user experience. Let the agentic team story be a secondary narrative that enhances credibility rather than a primary claim that invites scepticism.

## 3. Community Growth Recommendations

### 3.1 Token-Based Community Seeding Strategy

The human-friendly token system (D028, D029) is not just access control infrastructure. It is community engagement infrastructure. Each token is a relationship with a community.

**Seeding plan -- Phase 1 (first 30 days):**

| Token | Community | Allocation | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|------------|---------|
| `klingon-institute` | Klingon Language Institute | 500 transfers | Thank them for the cultural moment. Ask for translation review. |
| `privacy-advocates` | Privacy-focused communities (EFF lists, privacy Reddit, Signal groups) | 1,000 transfers | Core target audience. Validate product-market fit. |
| `security-meetup` | InfoSec meetup organisers | 500 transfers | Earn credibility with technical security community. |
| `indie-hackers` | IndieHackers community | 500 transfers | Developer-entrepreneur audience. Likely to share and write about it. |
| `hacker-news` | Hacker News Show HN post | 1,000 transfers | High-visibility launch moment. Needs careful timing. |
| `dev-community` | dev.to readers | 500 transfers | Accompanies a technical blog post about IFD or i18n. |
| `friendlies-beta` | Personal network, waiting list | 200 transfers | Controlled beta with known users. Sherpa tracks their journeys. |

**Total Phase 1 allocation:** 4,200 transfers across 7 communities.

**Seeding plan -- Phase 2 (days 30-60):**

Analyse Phase 1 data:
- Which tokens had the highest usage rate?
- Which communities produced repeat senders (viral loop success)?
- Which communities generated feedback or bug reports (engaged users)?
- Which communities produced referrals (organic growth)?

Double down on the top performers. Retire underperforming tokens. Introduce new tokens for communities identified during Phase 1.

**Metrics to track per token:**

| Metric | What It Tells Us |
|--------|-----------------|
| Activation rate (token used / token distributed) | Is the community interested? |
| Transfers per activated user | Are users finding ongoing value? |
| Recipient-to-sender conversion | Is the viral loop working in this community? |
| Time to first transfer | How quickly do users understand the product? |
| Feedback volume | How engaged is this community? |

### 3.2 LinkedIn-to-Product Pipeline Design

The LinkedIn post creates awareness. The pipeline converts awareness into usage:

```
LinkedIn post (awareness)
    |
    v
Engagement (likes, comments, shares)
    |
    v
Profile visit / "Learn more" click
    |
    v
Landing page at send.sgraph.ai
    |
    v
"Try it" action (upload a file or send text)
    |
    v
First transfer completed (activation)
    |
    v
Recipient receives file (viral loop begins)
    |
    v
Recipient becomes sender (viral loop completes)
```

**Current gaps in this pipeline:**

1. **No link in the LinkedIn post body.** If the post does not include a direct link to send.sgraph.ai, the pipeline breaks at step 3. Ensure every LinkedIn post includes the product URL.
2. **Landing page does not explain itself well enough** (per first-user feedback in Brief #1). The pipeline leaks at step 4 if visitors do not understand what the product does within 10 seconds. The Journalist's landing page copy ("Send files. Simply. Securely.") needs to ship.
3. **No tracking of LinkedIn-sourced traffic.** With GA removed, we need the cache service analytics to identify traffic sources. A dedicated token for LinkedIn traffic (`linkedin-feb`) would let us measure this directly: how many LinkedIn viewers became users?
4. **The viral loop (steps 6-7) is the growth engine.** Every transfer creates a recipient. Every recipient is a potential sender. The Ambassador cares about the ratio: what percentage of recipients send their own file? This is the viral coefficient. If it exceeds 1.0, growth is self-sustaining.

**Recommendation:** Create a `linkedin` token for all LinkedIn-sourced traffic. Include the tokenised URL in every LinkedIn post. This gives us exact attribution: "The Klingon post generated X visits, Y transfers, Z new senders."

### 3.3 Target Community Prioritisation

Ranked by expected impact (combination of audience size, alignment with product values, and likelihood of viral amplification):

| Rank | Community | Why First |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **1** | **InfoSec / privacy practitioners** | Core audience. Highest product-market fit. They verify claims, and our claims are verifiable. A positive review from this community is the strongest trust signal. |
| **2** | **Developer communities** (HN, dev.to, IndieHackers) | Large, vocal, and technically curious. The IFD methodology, zero-dependency stack, and agentic team stories are all compelling to this audience. They also build products and may integrate or recommend SGraph Send. |
| **3** | **Privacy-conscious general users** (Reddit r/privacy, r/degoogle, privacy forums) | High intent. These users actively seek privacy-respecting alternatives. SGraph Send's zero-cookie claim is directly relevant to their decision criteria. |
| **4** | **Startup / AI communities** | The agentic team story resonates here. Founders are curious about AI-augmented development. The "22 role responses, 3 versions shipped" narrative is compelling proof of what small teams can achieve. |
| **5** | **Constructed language / niche communities** (Klingon, Esperanto, linguistic enthusiasts) | Small but vocal. High engagement rate. Excellent for early brand awareness and shareable content. Low cost, high novelty. |
| **6** | **Accessibility advocates** | Aligns with the planned theme system (high contrast, dark mode). Timing: engage after themes ship, not before. Accessibility communities value products that deliver, not products that promise. |
| **7** | **Enterprise security / compliance** | Longer sales cycle. Not the MVP target. But the zero-cookie, zero-knowledge, server-side-only posture is attractive for compliance-conscious organisations. Seed relationships now for later conversion. |

## 4. External Messaging Priority

### Top 5 Stories to Tell Externally Right Now

Ranked by a combination of timeliness, uniqueness, verifiability, and audience reach:

---

**#1: "Zero Cookies. Provably."**

- **Core message:** SGraph Send uses no cookies, no third-party tracking, no consent banners. You can verify it yourself in your browser's developer tools.
- **Why #1:** This is the single strongest differentiator. Every other file sharing service has a cookie banner. We do not. The absence is the message. And unlike most privacy claims, this one is verifiable by the user in 5 seconds.
- **Format:** LinkedIn post, landing page copy, privacy page.
- **Timing:** Next 3-5 days (while the Klingon post is still generating engagement).
- **Audience:** Privacy-conscious users, InfoSec practitioners, compliance professionals.

---

**#2: "Your Files Are Encrypted Before They Leave Your Browser"**

- **Core message:** Zero-knowledge encryption. The server stores ciphertext. The decryption key never touches the server. We literally cannot read your files.
- **Why #2:** This is the product's fundamental value proposition. "Zero cookies" is the hook; "zero knowledge" is the substance. Together they form an unassailable privacy position.
- **Format:** Explainer post (LinkedIn or blog), landing page "How It Works" section.
- **Timing:** Week 2 (after the zero-cookie post establishes the privacy narrative).
- **Audience:** Anyone who sends sensitive files -- journalists, lawyers, healthcare workers, financial professionals, anyone handling confidential information.

---

**#3: "Built by an Agentic AI Team -- Here's the Evidence"**

- **Core message:** 12 AI roles, 22 responses, 20 decisions, 3 UI versions, 4 languages, 4,573 lines of code -- in a single session. This is not "AI-generated code." This is an AI team operating like a real engineering organisation.
- **Why #3:** The AI narrative is timely and attention-grabbing. But the key differentiator is evidence. Most AI-building claims are vague. Ours comes with role reviews, decision logs, and shipped code. The specificity is the credibility.
- **Format:** Long-form LinkedIn post or blog post. Include links to actual deliverables if the repo is public.
- **Timing:** Week 2-3 (after the privacy narrative is established, so the AI story enhances rather than overshadows the product story).
- **Audience:** AI/ML practitioners, engineering leaders, startup founders, tech journalists.

---

**#4: "Multilingual from Day One -- Including Klingon"**

- **Core message:** The i18n architecture supports any language, including constructed ones. Four languages live at MVP. Regional variants (Brazilian vs. European Portuguese) handled correctly.
- **Why #4:** The Klingon post has already started this narrative. The follow-up should deepen it: explain the architecture, show the language files, invite community translations.
- **Format:** The LinkedIn post is already live. Follow up with a technical breakdown (dev.to or blog) and community outreach (Klingon Language Institute, Esperanto communities).
- **Timing:** Ongoing (the Klingon post is already in market; amplify and deepen).
- **Audience:** Developer communities, language enthusiasts, international users.

---

**#5: "We Replaced Google Analytics Because It Violated Our Principles"**

- **Core message:** We wired up Google Analytics. Then we removed it. Third-party tracking has no place in a zero-knowledge product. We built our own server-side analytics instead.
- **Why #5:** The strategic reversal (D024) is a strong narrative. Most companies add tracking and never question it. We added it, evaluated it, and removed it -- on principle. The story of removing GA is more interesting than never having it, because it demonstrates active decision-making rather than passive omission.
- **Format:** LinkedIn post or blog post. Frame it as a decision story, not a feature announcement.
- **Timing:** Week 3-4 (after the replacement analytics via cache service are operational, so we can say "we replaced it with something better" rather than "we removed it and now have nothing").
- **Audience:** Privacy advocates, developers, product managers, anyone who has struggled with the GA-versus-privacy trade-off.

---

### Messaging Principles for All External Communication

1. **State facts. Provide evidence. Let the audience verify.** SGraph Send's claims are provably true. That is the differentiator. Never overstate. Never use language that cannot be verified.
2. **Lead with utility, follow with security.** The product sends files. The encryption is what makes it trustworthy. Do not lead with the encryption -- lead with "send a file, simply, securely."
3. **Be specific, not superlative.** "Zero cookies" is better than "the most private." "AES-256-GCM" is better than "military-grade encryption." "4 languages at MVP" is better than "global from day one."
4. **Show, do not tell.** Screenshots of real UI. URLs to real versions. Browser dev tools showing empty cookie jars. The proof is the marketing.
5. **Invite verification, not trust.** "You do not have to trust our privacy policy. Open dev tools. Check the cookies tab. It is empty." This is the single most powerful sentence in our external messaging.

---

## 6. Risk Register

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Competitive claims are inaccurate** | HIGH | Fact-check every competitor claim before any external comparison. Do not publish the competitive table until verified. |
| **"Built by AI" narrative backfires** | MEDIUM | Always lead with the product. The AI story is secondary. If audiences dismiss the product because of AI origin, the product story was not strong enough. |
| **Klingon perceived as unserious** | LOW | The technical explanation (i18n architecture proof) reframes Klingon as engineering demonstration. The LinkedIn post's tone is already correct -- playful but backed by substance. |
| **Zero-cookie claim invalidated** | HIGH | AppSec must verify before any external publication. If any component (CDN, error handler, framework) sets a cookie, the claim is false and must not be made. The 5 verification requests from the Journalist are critical. |
| **Viral coefficient below 1.0** | MEDIUM | Expected at MVP stage. The metric matters for trajectory, not for the absolute value today. Track it from day one so we can measure improvement. |
| **Token system delays block community seeding** | MEDIUM | Phase 1 seeding depends on human-friendly tokens (D028). If delayed, use manual token distribution and track externally until the system is live. |

---

## 7. Coordination Requests

| To | Request | Context |
|----|---------|---------|
| **AppSec** | Verify all 5 claims flagged by the Journalist (zero cookies, no fingerprinting, IP hashing, GA removal, empty localStorage). No external publication until verified. | [Journalist Brief #2 Response, Section 8](../../../../roles/journalist/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__response-to-daily-brief-2__13-feb.md) |
| **Journalist** | Collaborate on the next 5 LinkedIn posts (Section 1.4 above). Ambassador provides the strategy and positioning; Journalist writes the copy. | This is the primary Ambassador-Journalist collaboration |
| **Sherpa** | Share the friction log data (13 friction points) so the Ambassador can assess which frictions impact the viral loop most. Recipient flow friction is growth-critical. | [Sherpa First-Time User Journey Map](../../../../roles/sherpa/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__first-time-user-journey-map-and-friction-log.md) |
| **Dev** | Prioritise the `linkedin-feb` tracking token as a test case for the human-friendly token system. It gives us immediate attribution data for the LinkedIn campaign. | Depends on D028 implementation |
| **Conductor** | Align the "Zero Cookies" LinkedIn post timing with AppSec verification completion. The post cannot go live until the claim is confirmed. | Sequencing dependency |
| **Historian** | Provide the complete decision log (D001-D033) in a format suitable for external publication. The "agentic team" story needs concrete evidence. | Decisions are the proof artifacts |

## Summary

SGraph Send's v0.1.3 session delivered a genuinely differentiated market position. The LinkedIn Klingon post is a strong opening move. The immediate priority is to sustain the external narrative with a sequence of posts (zero cookies, zero knowledge, IFD methodology, agentic team, first user story) while building the token-based community seeding infrastructure in parallel.

The Ambassador's core thesis: **SGraph Send's strongest marketing asset is verifiability.** Every privacy claim can be checked by the user in their browser. No other competitor offers this. The external messaging should lead with that verifiability -- "do not trust us, verify us" -- because it converts sceptics into advocates more effectively than any marketing copy.

The Klingon got them to look. The zero-cookie story gets them to stay. The zero-knowledge encryption gets them to trust. The viral loop gets them to share.

That is the growth funnel. The Ambassador's job is to keep filling the top.
