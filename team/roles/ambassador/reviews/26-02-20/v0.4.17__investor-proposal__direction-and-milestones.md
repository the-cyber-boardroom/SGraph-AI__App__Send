## Why This Document

Following our conversation, we want to make sure we're building what you actually need — not what we assume you need. This document lays out our current direction and key milestones, from both a user experience and technology perspective.

**We'd like you to confirm:**
1. Does this match your expectations?
2. Are we missing anything critical?
3. Is the priority order right?

Your feedback before the meeting means we can focus the demo on what matters to you.

## What Works Today (v0.4.17)

SG/Send is live at [send.sgraph.ai](https://send.sgraph.ai). The core product works end-to-end:

1. **Sender** opens SG/Send in a browser — no app, no account
2. **Drops a file** or types a message
3. **Content is encrypted in the browser** (AES-256-GCM) before upload
4. **Sender gets a link and a decryption key** — shares them via separate channels
5. **Recipient** opens the link, enters the key, decrypts in their browser — no app, no account

**The server never sees your data.** Not during upload, not during storage, not during download. The encryption key never leaves the sender's device. Even with full access to our infrastructure, all anyone finds is encrypted bytes.

This isn't a planned feature — it's the current architecture. It has been independently validated by a senior security professional with 25 years of experience, who described the UX as *"foolproof — like Google search"* and the crypto as *"the correct implementation."*

## The Direction: Three Steps

### Step 1: Eliminate Key Exchange Friction (PKI)

**The problem you raised:** sharing the decryption key via a separate channel works, but adds friction. You want to say "send this to Alice" and have it just work.

**Our solution:** Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) — recipient-addressed encryption.

How it works:
- **Alice generates a key pair** in her browser (private key stays in the browser, never leaves)
- **Alice gets a short code** (e.g., `A7X9F2`) linked to her public key
- **You enter Alice's code** when sending → SG/Send encrypts with her public key
- **Alice opens the link** → her browser decrypts automatically using her private key
- **No key to share. No second channel. One link, one click.**

The server still never sees the plaintext or any private key. Zero-knowledge is preserved.

**Status:** Technical research complete. The browser's Web Crypto API supports everything natively (ECDH P-256 key agreement, AES-256-GCM encryption). No external libraries needed. >97% browser coverage.

### Step 2: LLM Integration — "Claude, Send This Securely"

**The workflow you described:** You're composing an NDA in Claude. You say "Claude, send this to [founder] via SG/Send." Claude encrypts, uploads, and sends the link. Done.

**Our approach:**

| Tool | What It Does | Who Can Use It |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **CLI tool (`sg_send`)** | Encrypt + upload from the command line | Any LLM with shell access (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Codex) |
| **MCP Server** | Expose SG/Send as a tool via the Model Context Protocol | Claude Desktop, Claude Code, any MCP client |

**Why this preserves security:** You're already trusting Claude with the document (you composed it there). We're not adding a new trust boundary — just automating the encryption and delivery. The SG/Send server still never sees plaintext.

**What we rejected:** OpenAI GPT Actions — they cannot perform client-side encryption, which would require sending plaintext to the server. That breaks the zero-knowledge model. We won't do it.

**Status:** Implementation plan complete. CLI tool is first (works with all LLMs immediately), MCP server wraps the same code.

### Step 3: Dedicated Instances — Your Own SG/Send

**What it means:** An SG/Send deployment running in its own infrastructure — your branding, your domain, your region, fully isolated from other customers.

Three deployment models:

| Model | What You Get | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Managed instance** | We host it, you use it. Custom domain (`yourfirm.send.sgraph.ai`), your logo. | Teams that want isolation without infrastructure management |
| **Self-hosted** | Deployed in YOUR AWS/GCP account. You own everything. We never touch it. | Maximum control. Data never leaves your environment. |
| **Ephemeral** | Spin up for a deal, tear down when it closes. Infrastructure as disposable as the messages. | Per-deal data rooms, time-limited projects |

**Infrastructure cost:** Serverless (Lambda + S3). An idle dedicated instance costs pennies/month. Under typical usage (10-50 transfers/day): estimated under £15/month. The margin on dedicated instances is very high.

**Status:** Deployment templates in progress. We plan to demo this at our next meeting — a live instance with your branding, running in your preferred region.

## Technology Choices — Why They Matter

| Choice | Why |
|--------|-----|
| **Browser encryption, not server** | Server compromise = zero privacy impact. This is the entire security model. |
| **Open source (Apache 2.0)** | Anyone can verify the crypto. For a zero-knowledge tool, a security reviewer told us: *"that's not optional."* |
| **No app required** | The recipient just needs a browser. No install, no account. This is why adoption is frictionless. |
| **Serverless (Lambda + S3)** | Scales to zero. No idle costs. New instances in minutes, not days. |
| **Vanilla JS, no frameworks** | No React, no build toolchain, no framework churn. The browser is the platform. |
| **7 deployment targets** | Lambda, Docker, GCP Cloud Run, Fargate, EC2, PyPI, CLI. Same codebase, any infrastructure. |

## The Market Position

**The gap we fill:**

| | Email | WeTransfer | Data Rooms (Intralinks) | SG/Send |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| End-to-end encrypted | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| Server can read files | Yes | Yes | Yes | **Never** |
| Recipient needs software | No | No | Yes (account) | **No** |
| Open source / verifiable | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| Self-hostable | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| Price | Free | £12-229/mo | £3,000-10,000/mo | **£49-999/mo** |

**In the reviewer's words:** *"Most existing solutions fail on multiple dimensions: uncomfortable to use, overkill for such a simple task, don't provide a zero-knowledge guarantee, or they're expensive. Usually a combination of all four."*

## What We'd Like From You

1. **Does this direction match your expectations?** Specifically: PKI first, then LLM integration, then dedicated instances — is that the right order for your use case?

2. **Which deployment model fits?** Managed instance, self-hosted in your AWS, or something else?

3. **What's your first use case?** Is it sending deal documents to portfolio companies? Sharing credentials? Something we haven't thought of?

4. **Would you use the Claude integration?** The "send this via SG/Send" workflow — is that part of your daily workflow, or a nice-to-have?

5. **What would make you a paying customer?** What's the minimum set of features, and what's the right price point?

---

## Next Steps

We'll send this to you before our meeting so you can review at your own pace. At the meeting, we'll show:

1. **PKI working in the browser** — generate keys, encrypt for a recipient, decrypt without key exchange
2. **Claude sending a document via SG/Send** — the workflow you described
3. **Your branded instance running live** — your logo, your domain, your region

If any of this doesn't match what you're looking for, tell us now. We'd rather adjust course before building than after.
