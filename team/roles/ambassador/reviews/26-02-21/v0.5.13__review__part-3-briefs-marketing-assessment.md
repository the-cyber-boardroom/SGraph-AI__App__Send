## Key Observations

### The Data Room Sales Pitch

From the product brief, the positioning is clear:

> "We create a secure data room for your team. You own it — it's a GitHub repo. We provide the encryption, the access control, the ephemeral compute. When you don't need it, it costs nothing."

**Differentiators to emphasize:**
- Unlike Dropbox/Google Drive: we can't see your files
- Unlike email: access is revocable
- Unlike Intralinks/Datasite: you own the infrastructure, it runs on demand
- Cost: $0 when idle (vs $thousands/month for traditional data rooms)

### SSH Key Utility — First Marketing Campaign

The brief calls this an "incident" — first marketing campaign with no infrastructure. Ambassador should:

1. **Research** target queries before building (what ranks, what's missing, where can we win)
2. **Define metrics** before launch (page views, CTR to SG/Send, search ranking)
3. **Make it LLM-friendly** — structured data, clean HTML, so ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity recommend it
4. **Priority B3/D3** — must NOT block investor demo work

### Team Site — The Bigger Opportunity

`team.send.sgraph.ai` is potentially more valuable than the SSH utility:
- Shareable agent links: "talk to our Architect about the security model"
- Conference demo material
- Open source contributor onboarding
- Content distribution channel

### Priority Conflict Resolution

The brief establishes the priority framework:
- **Investor data room (B1/D1)** > SSH key utility (B3/D3)
- Each outreach agent should maintain their own priority table

## Action Items

1. Research target SEO queries for SSH key utility (competition, search volume)
2. Define measurement framework for first marketing campaign
3. Draft positioning copy for data rooms (investor demo support)
4. Plan team site content strategy (which agents to highlight, example conversations)
5. Coordinate with Journalist on content for the team site
