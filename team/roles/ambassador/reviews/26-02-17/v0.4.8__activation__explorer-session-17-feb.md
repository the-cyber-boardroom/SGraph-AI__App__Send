## Context Since Last Activity

### What the Ambassador Last Produced (14 Feb)

The Ambassador's last output was the v0.3.2 Explorer action plan (32KB):
- Central thesis: "SGraph Send is not a WeTransfer alternative. It is a file-sharing service for people who cannot afford to trust the server."
- Competitive map: Firefox Send (discontinued — "the vacant throne"), Wormhole, OnionShare, standard cloud storage, enterprise platforms
- Messaging hierarchy: WHAT IT DOES / WHY IT'S DIFFERENT / WHY TO TRUST US
- Audience segmentation: privacy-aware professionals, journalists/activists, developers, enterprise, healthcare/legal
- Viral loop optimisation strategy

### Key Project Changes (v0.3.2 -> v0.4.8)

1. **Strategic pivot (D038):** SG/Send is now an "encrypted workflow platform", not just file transfer. This fundamentally changes the competitive positioning. SG/Send is no longer competing with WeTransfer/Wormhole — it's in a category of its own.

2. **Interactive encrypted data workflows:** JSON data with UI schemas, encrypted round-trips, dynamic interactive UIs rendered client-side. Three use cases: translation review, client-side translation as product, general-purpose encrypted workflows (approval, surveys, code review, data collection).

3. **Brand identity (D045):** "SG/Send" adopted as brand shorthand. Design guidelines and logo briefs produced. The slash is the hero element.

4. **Translator role + non-English market hypothesis:** There's likely a bigger market for secure file sharing in non-English-speaking countries (underserved, not saturated). Every language added = a market entered.

5. **Two-team operation:** Explorer and Villager briefs are now separate. The Villager team has beta programme tasks (marketing copy, invite cards) that overlap with Ambassador territory.

### Ambassador-Specific Impact

- **Competitive map needs update:** The pivot to "encrypted workflow platform" changes the competitive frame entirely. The Ambassador's Feb 14 competitive analysis was file-transfer-focused.
- **New positioning required:** The messaging hierarchy (WHAT IT DOES / WHY IT'S DIFFERENT / WHY TO TRUST US) needs to reflect the workflow platform vision.
- **Non-English market:** The Translator brief introduces a growth hypothesis that the Ambassador should own — market research into non-English-speaking countries for secure communication tools.
- **Viral loop evolution:** Interactive workflows create a richer viral loop than simple file transfer — every encrypted form/survey/approval is a product demo.

### Pending Tasks from v0.4.4 Debrief

| Priority | Task | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| LOW | No immediate Explorer action assigned | Per v0.4.4 debrief |
| Reference | Villager tasks: beta programme marketing copy, invite cards | Not Explorer scope |

**Note:** The v0.4.4 debrief listed the Ambassador as "should NOT be active" for Explorer. The human stakeholder is now explicitly activating this role.
