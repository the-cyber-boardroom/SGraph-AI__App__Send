**Type:** Comprehensive response -- brief catalogue, messaging assessment, gap analysis, consolidated matrix, next steps
**Previous review:** [v0.4.8 Activation](../26-02-17/v0.4.8__activation__explorer-session-17-feb.md)
**Previous action plan:** [v0.3.2 Explorer Next Steps](../26-02-14/v0.3.2__action-plan__explorer-next-steps.md)

## Executive Summary

Five briefs were prepared for the Ambassador role on 17 February 2026 but never catalogued or responded to. This document processes all five, assesses their readiness for external use, integrates validation data from the industry dinner (18 Feb) and partner ecosystem brief (18 Feb), maps User A's quote across all materials, identifies gaps, produces a consolidated messaging matrix, and recommends next steps.

**Overall assessment:** The investor materials (today/coming-soon/future-vision) are strong and nearly ready for external use. The accountants vertical is well-targeted and the strongest single-audience document in the set. The agentic team briefing is compelling but needs positioning adjustments before it faces investor audiences. The industry dinner validated core messaging and produced a new tagline candidate ("Signal for the web") that should be tested across all materials.

**Key finding:** We now have three validated framings for SG/Send from real users:
1. User A (security reviewer): "I can't tell you how many times I've needed something like this" -- the unmet-need framing
2. User A (follow-up): "the other party needs the same tech, which is not always the case" -- the asymmetry framing
3. Tube stranger (industry dinner): "So this is like Signal for the web, right?" -- the analogy framing

All three point to the same differentiator: **the recipient does not need to install anything, create an account, or use a specific app.** This is now validated by three independent users across two different contexts (remote security review, in-person encounter). The messaging materials should lead with this.

## Part 2: Assessment of Investor Messaging Materials

### Overall Structure Assessment

The three-document structure (Today / Coming Soon / Future Vision) is excellent. It follows a proven investor communication pattern:

1. **Today** = credibility ("we have a working product, try it now")
2. **Coming Soon** = momentum ("we're building fast, here's what's next")
3. **Future Vision** = ambition ("here's where this goes, and it's big")

This progression takes the reader from "does this work?" to "should I care?" to "could this be transformative?" -- which is exactly the investor journey.

### Document 1: What Works Today -- Assessment

**Strengths:**
- The problem statement is authentic and well-targeted. Every investment professional will recognise the "email the term sheet" problem.
- The "Two Secrets, Two Channels" section is clear and accessible. The table format works well.
- Five use cases are concrete and specific. The "Simple Encrypted Data Room" use case (#4) is particularly strong because it shows how a basic feature can serve a sophisticated need.
- The "Portfolio Company Isolation" use case (#5) is strategically important -- it addresses a governance concern that is top-of-mind for any firm managing multiple investments.
- Deployment options and cost section are transparent and credible. The "$50/month for a dedicated instance" figure is powerful.
- The "No contracts. No minimum commitment." closing is excellent for early-stage engagement.

**Needs refining:**
- **Missing: User A's quote.** This document does not include any user validation. Adding "As one of our beta users put it: 'I can't tell you how many times I've needed something like this'" would add significant credibility. A real user saying this is worth more than any marketing copy.
- **Missing: the asymmetry argument.** The core differentiator ("the other party needs the same tech, which is not always the case") is not stated explicitly anywhere. The document says "no software to install" and "no accounts to create" but does not frame it as the key advantage over Signal, Proton, or other E2E tools. It should. This is what makes SG/Send different from every competitor, not just from email.
- **URL inconsistency.** The document references "send.sgraph.com" in some places and "send.sgraph.ai" in others. Standardise to `send.sgraph.ai`.
- **"Two Secrets, Two Channels" framing could be stronger.** The current explanation is accurate but neutral. It should lean into the fact that this is a deliberate security design, not a limitation. Something like: "This separation is the foundation of the security model. It means no single channel compromise can expose your data."
- **Missing: what happens to the data over time.** Investors will ask about data lifecycle. Add a sentence about retention, deletion, and the upcoming TTL feature.

**Readiness:** 85% ready for external use. Needs the user quote, the asymmetry argument, and URL standardisation.

### Document 2: What's Coming Next -- Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Clear distinction between "near-term release" and "professional services engagement" is honest and builds trust. No overpromising.
- The professional services table with timelines is excellent -- it gives investors a concrete way to engage.
- The three workflow examples (due diligence, board materials, portfolio reporting) are the strongest content in the document. They paint a complete picture of how the features compose into real workflows.
- The "Getting Started" section elegantly bridges from the Today document and encourages starting with what works now.

**Needs refining:**
- **Some features are described as "near-term" that are still in development.** The Ambassador needs to verify with the Architect and Developer which features are genuinely near-term (weeks) vs medium-term (months). Investor-facing documents must not overpromise timelines.
- **The "Enhanced Data Room" section is the longest but may be premature.** Structured data rooms, multi-room management, and key management integration are significant engineering work. The document positions them as "near-term development" which may set unrealistic expectations.
- **Missing: competitive context.** What alternatives do investors currently use for these workflows? Even a brief mention ("Today, most firms use Intralinks or Datasite for data rooms at $25K+ per deal") would frame the value proposition.
- **Missing: User A's quote.** Not directly applicable here, but a reference back to it ("Our beta users are already telling us they need these features") would strengthen the narrative.

**Readiness:** 75% ready. Needs timeline verification and competitive context. The "near-term" claims must be validated before sharing externally.

### Document 3: Future Vision -- Assessment

**Strengths:**
- The vision is genuinely ambitious and compelling. Automatic translation, semantic knowledge extraction, interactive encrypted workflows, and a governance dashboard -- this paints a picture of a platform, not just a file sharing tool.
- The "Complete Picture" workflow diagram at the end is the single most powerful visual in all three documents. It shows the entire investment lifecycle served by one platform.
- The transparency on roadmap timing is a strength, not a weakness. Investors appreciate knowing what is real vs aspirational.
- The competitive advantage section at the end is strong: "Most encrypted communication tools solve one piece of this puzzle."

**Needs refining:**
- **The semantic knowledge extraction section may be too speculative for some investor audiences.** Client-side LLM analysis via WASM is technically feasible but early-stage. For conservative investors, this could read as science fiction. Consider marking it more clearly as "research" vs "in development."
- **The WebRTC section is thin.** It would benefit from a concrete use case for investors (e.g., "During a live due diligence call, share documents directly between browsers without any server involvement").
- **Missing: how this competes with incumbent platforms.** The vision document should name the incumbents it displaces (Intralinks, Datasite, Citrix ShareFile for data rooms; Bloomberg Vault for encrypted comms in finance). This grounds the vision in market reality.
- **The "Secrets Manager as a Service" section may confuse non-technical investors.** Consider reframing as "Key Management" with a simpler explanation of why it matters.

**Readiness:** 70% ready. This is a strong vision document but needs careful audience-calibration. For technically sophisticated investors (VCs, angel investors with tech backgrounds), it is ready now. For traditional finance audiences, some sections need simplification.

## Part 3: Assessment of the Accountants Vertical

### Overall Assessment

**This is the strongest single-audience document in the entire set.** It is better targeted, more concrete, and more actionable than the investor documents.

**Why it works:**
1. **The problem statement is specific and universal.** Every accountant will recognise "client emails you a photo of their passport." This is not a theoretical risk -- it happens every day in every practice.
2. **The "What Your Client Sees" section is the key differentiator.** No account creation. No app installation. No portal login. Just a link and a key. This directly addresses the biggest barrier to adoption for accountancy: client friction.
3. **The regulatory alignment table is excellent.** GDPR, AML/KYC, ICAEW/ACCA, professional indemnity, HMRC -- these are the exact frameworks accountants think in. Mapping SG/Send to these frameworks makes the product feel like a compliance solution, not just a security tool.
4. **The cost comparison is powerful.** "Compare this to: a client portal subscription ($50-$200/month), a secure email add-on ($5-$15/user/month), or the cost of a data breach" -- this frames SG/Send as radically cheaper than alternatives while being more secure.
5. **The use cases are ordered by frequency and pain.** Tax returns (most common) first, contracts (least common) last. This is good information architecture.

### What Needs Refining

- **Missing: User A's quote.** Adapt it for the accountant context: "As one user told us: 'I can't tell you how many times I've needed something like this. If you use Signal, Proton, or whatever else, the other party needs the same tech, which is not always the case.' For accountants, this is the key point -- your clients don't need to install anything."
- **Missing: a named competitor comparison.** The document mentions "client portals" generically but does not name specific competitors (Senta, Karbon, TaxCalc client portal, Xero Practice Manager). Naming them would sharpen the positioning.
- **The "Document Signing" row in the coming-next table is risky.** Document signing is a major feature with its own competitive landscape (DocuSign, Adobe Sign, Signable). Mentioning "research in progress" is fine, but the document should not imply this is imminent.
- **Missing: a case study or scenario walkthrough.** The five use cases are good but abstract. A concrete scenario -- "Sarah is a sole practitioner in Manchester with 120 clients. Here's how her week changes with SG/Send..." -- would make the document more compelling.
- **The "What's Coming Next" table mixes near-term features with speculative ones.** Expiring links and one-time download are genuinely near-term. Document signing and client authentication are much further out. The table should distinguish between these more clearly.
- **Missing: "Signal for the web" framing.** The tube stranger's tagline works perfectly for the accountant audience: "Think of it as Signal for the web -- end-to-end encrypted, but your client just needs a browser." Test this.

### Readiness

**90% ready for external use.** This document can be shared with accountancy firms today with minor edits. The regulatory alignment table alone makes it worth sharing. Add the user quote, tighten the "coming next" timeline indicators, and it is ready.

## Part 4: Assessment of the Agentic Team Briefing

### Overall Assessment

This is a compelling, well-structured document that tells a genuinely interesting story. The question is not whether it is good -- it is -- but whether it is suitable for external audiences and, if so, which ones.

### Audience Suitability

| Audience | Suitability | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Technology investors / VCs** | HIGH | They understand AI, they understand the productivity multiplier, they will be impressed by the "one human, 18 roles, 75+ documents in 5 days" metric. This is exactly the kind of proof point that excites tech investors. |
| **Traditional finance investors** | MEDIUM | They may not understand the technical details but will be impressed by the productivity story. Needs a simpler framing: "One person producing the output of a 10-person team." |
| **Potential partners** | HIGH | Partners evaluating SG/Send will want to know how the product is built and maintained. This document demonstrates that the team (even though it is one person + AI) can produce at scale. |
| **Technology conferences / thought leadership** | VERY HIGH | This is a conference talk, a blog series, and a LinkedIn content machine all in one document. The "state of agentic AI in February 2026" framing is timely and newsworthy. |
| **Potential hires** | HIGH | Anyone considering joining the project would want to understand how the team works. This document is honest about what works and what is hard. |
| **General public** | LOW | Too detailed, too technical, too inside-baseball. Needs a 500-word summary version for general audiences. |

### Positioning Adjustments Needed

1. **Separate the "how we work" story from the "what we build" story.** Currently the document mixes SG/Send product description with agentic workflow methodology. For external audiences, these should be separate narratives that reference each other. An investor cares about the product first, the methodology second. A conference audience cares about the methodology first, the product second.

2. **The "what we've learned" section is the most externally valuable content.** "The file system as communication channel eliminates coordination overhead" and "Voice memos to structured briefs is a killer workflow" are insights that anyone building agentic systems would want to hear. Consider extracting this into a standalone thought leadership piece.

3. **The metrics need context.** "75+ markdown files" and "~950KB of structured content" are impressive to people who understand documentation-driven development. For others, translate to outcomes: "18 complete role specifications, 6 investor and customer pitch documents, a full security incident response, and a live product with real users -- produced by one person with AI assistance in 5 days."

4. **The "human is the bottleneck" section should be reframed for investors.** Currently it reads as a limitation. Reframe as a quality control feature: "Every output is reviewed by the project lead before it enters the system. This is not a bottleneck -- it is a quality gate. The AI accelerates production; the human ensures quality."

5. **Remove or soften the "what's hard" section for investor-facing versions.** The honesty is refreshing for technical audiences but may concern investors. The "context window limits require session management" and "agent-to-agent communication is indirect" points could be read as fundamental limitations rather than current constraints.

6. **Add the industry dinner validation.** Multiple people at the dinner were curious about the agentic team model. This is external validation that the story resonates. Include it.

### Readiness

**60% ready for external use as-is.** Needs audience-specific versions:
- **Investor version (2 pages):** Focus on productivity metrics, outcomes, and the quality gate model. Remove technical details about context windows and file system communication.
- **Conference version (full):** The current document is nearly ready. Add the industry dinner validation and strengthen the "what we've learned" section.
- **Blog series (5 parts):** Extract each section into a standalone piece. Part 1: The Setup. Part 2: The Two Teams. Part 3: Files Not Conversations. Part 4: What We've Learned. Part 5: The Bigger Picture.

## Part 5: User A's Quote -- Cross-Material Mapping

### The Quote

> "I can't tell you how many times I've needed something like this. I mean if you use Signal, Proton, or whatever else, the other party needs the same tech, which is not always the case, right?"

This quote captures two distinct messages:
1. **The unmet need:** "I've needed something like this" -- the market exists, the pain is real
2. **The asymmetry advantage:** "the other party needs the same tech" -- SG/Send's key differentiator

### Current Usage Across Materials

| Document | Uses the quote? | Uses the asymmetry argument? |
|---|---|---|
| Investor -- Today | No | Partially ("no software to install") but does not frame it as a competitive advantage over Signal/Proton |
| Investor -- Coming Soon | No | No |
| Investor -- Future Vision | No | No |
| Accountants | No | Yes ("the core principle: your client doesn't need to install anything") -- this is the strongest implicit use |
| Agentic Team Briefing | No | No |
| Daily Brief (17 Feb) | Yes -- quoted in full | Yes -- "The Ambassador should build messaging around this exact framing" |
| Industry Dinner Brief | No -- but adds "Signal for the web" framing | Indirectly -- the tube stranger's reaction validates the same insight |
| Partner Ecosystem Brief | No | No |

### Assessment

**The quote is severely underutilised.** It appears only in the daily brief (internal document). None of the five external-facing materials include it. The daily brief explicitly instructed the Ambassador to "build messaging around this exact framing" -- this has not been done yet.

### Recommended Integration

| Document | Where to Add | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Investor -- Today** | After the "How It Works" section, before Use Cases | "One of our early users put it simply: 'I can't tell you how many times I've needed something like this. If you use Signal, Proton, or whatever else, the other party needs the same tech.' With SG/Send, the recipient just needs a browser." |
| **Investor -- Coming Soon** | Opening paragraph, "Building on What Works" section | "Our users tell us the core workflow already solves a real problem. The features in this document make it more powerful, not more complicated." |
| **Investor -- Future Vision** | Opening or closing, depending on audience | "When a security professional tells you 'I've needed something like this' about your current product, and the roadmap takes that product from file sharing to an encrypted workflow platform -- that's the trajectory." |
| **Accountants** | After "What SG/Send Does" section | "As one user told us: 'If you use Signal, Proton, or whatever else, the other party needs the same tech, which is not always the case.' For accountants, this is the crucial point: your clients don't need to install anything, create any account, or learn any new tool. They click a link and enter a key." |
| **Agentic Team Briefing** | In the "What we've produced -- The Production Pipeline" section | "The product is not just technically complete -- it is validated by real users. A security professional who conducted a full code review said: 'I can't tell you how many times I've needed something like this.'" |

---

## Part 6: Industry Dinner -- Validation Data for Messaging

### Validation Data Points Extracted

| Data Point | Source | Messaging Implication |
|---|---|---|
| **"So this is like Signal for the web, right?"** | Tube stranger (AI/robotics professional) | New tagline candidate. Instantly understood by technical audiences. Test across materials. |
| **Business cards create engagement moments** | Dinner attendees (6 cards distributed) | Physical artefact distribution is a viable user acquisition channel. The Ambassador should formalise this. |
| **Agentic team model generates genuine interest** | Multiple dinner attendees | The "how we build" story is as compelling as the "what we build" story. Dual narrative strategy. |
| **Dropbox perceived as encrypted (it is not)** | Tube stranger | Perception gap = messaging opportunity. "Like Dropbox, but Dropbox can't see your files." |
| **The card-to-trial workflow works** | Tube stranger (tried the product on the tube) | Brief Designer created SVG, same-day printing, evening distribution, immediate trial. The pipeline is validated. |
| **"That's not very secure" (about reading documents in public)** | Tube stranger (unsolicited comment) | Security awareness exists in the general public. The market is receptive to the message. |
| **GitHub page has broken images** | Tube stranger (observed scrolling through) | Customer-facing surfaces need maintenance. GitHub README is a discovery channel. |

### "Signal for the Web" Assessment

**Should this become a primary tagline?**

| Consideration | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Accuracy** | High. SG/Send is end-to-end encrypted, simple to use, and does not require the recipient to install anything. The "for the web" part captures what Signal is not. |
| **Audience reach** | Technical: excellent. Signal is well-known in security/privacy circles. General: moderate. Many people have heard of Signal but do not use it. Non-technical: poor. Many people have never heard of Signal. |
| **Legal risk** | Low. "Signal for X" is a common informal comparison pattern, not a trademark infringement, as long as it is not presented as an official association. However, avoid using it in formal marketing materials without legal review. |
| **Competitive positioning** | Strong. It immediately positions SG/Send in the "encrypted communication" category while differentiating ("for the web = no app required"). |
| **Shelf life** | Medium. If Signal becomes less relevant or if they launch a web-only product, the comparison weakens. |

**Recommendation:** Use "Signal for the web" as an informal tagline for technical audiences (conference pitches, LinkedIn posts, developer community). Do not make it the primary brand tagline. Use it alongside the established messaging hierarchy:

- **Primary headline:** "Send files the server can't read." (from v0.3.2 action plan -- still the strongest)
- **Technical shorthand:** "Signal for the web." (new -- for security-aware audiences)
- **Business shorthand:** "Like Dropbox, but we can't see your files." (new -- from dinner feedback)
- **Accountant-specific:** "The secure way to share files. Your client just needs a browser." (from accountants document)

### Dropbox Comparison Messaging

The dinner produced a second organic comparison: "Like Dropbox, but Dropbox can't see your files." This is powerful because:
1. Everyone knows Dropbox
2. Most people assume Dropbox encrypts their files in a way that Dropbox cannot read them (it does not)
3. The correction ("Dropbox CAN see your files; SG/Send cannot") is a genuine education moment that creates engagement

**Research task (Ambassador + AppSec):** Verify and document the encryption models of Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud, and Box. Specifically: does the provider hold the keys? Can the provider read your files? This was already requested in the industry dinner brief but is now a formal Ambassador deliverable.

---

## Part 7: Partner Ecosystem -- Competitive Positioning Implications

### Key Insights from the Partner Ecosystem Brief

The partner ecosystem brief (18 Feb) fundamentally changes the competitive positioning:

| Insight | Impact on Messaging |
|---|---|
| **"We don't want to sell to large corporates directly"** | The investor pitch must reflect this. SG/Send is a technology platform, not a SaaS product. Revenue comes from professional services and partner ecosystem, not seat licences. |
| **Apache 2.0 licensing** | This is a major competitive differentiator. No other encrypted file sharing service offers this. The investor materials should lead with it: "Open source (Apache 2.0). Deploy in your environment. No licence fees. Ever." |
| **One-click deployment** | The deployment packaging strategy (PyPI, Docker Hub, CloudFormation, Terraform) makes SG/Send the easiest encrypted file sharing service to self-host. This is a competitive moat -- competitors like Tresorit and Bitwarden have self-hosted options but they are complex. |
| **"Partners are assets, not competitors"** | This is the commercial philosophy. The Ambassador should develop this into a "Partner Manifesto" document (already assigned in the brief). |
| **Creative Commons BY on all materials** | All Ambassador-produced materials (including the investor documents and accountants document) need the CC BY footer added. |

### Updated Competitive Positioning

The v0.3.2 action plan positioned SG/Send as "zero-trust file sharing." The partner ecosystem brief expands this to:

**Old position:** "File sharing where you don't have to trust the server."
**New position:** "Open-source, zero-knowledge encrypted communication. Deploy it yourself. We help if you want us to."

This is a stronger position because:
1. It encompasses more than file sharing (messages, workflows, data rooms)
2. "Open source" is verifiable and irrevocable -- it is the strongest trust signal possible
3. "Deploy it yourself" addresses the governance concern that every investor and corporate partner will raise
4. "We help if you want us to" positions professional services naturally

### Missing from Current Materials

The investor documents (Today/Coming Soon/Future Vision) were written before the partner ecosystem brief. They need updating to reflect:
- The Apache 2.0 licensing strategy
- The partner channel model (partners deploy for their customers)
- The one-click deployment vision (CloudFormation, Docker, etc.)
- The "technology is free, expertise costs money" commercial model

These are not minor additions -- they change the fundamental business model pitch. The investor documents currently read as a SaaS pitch ("use our deployment, or we set up a dedicated one for you"). They should read as a platform pitch ("the technology is open source; deploy it yourself, use our hosted version, or work with a partner").

## Part 8: Gap Analysis -- What Messaging Materials Are Still Missing

### Critical Gaps (P2)

| Gap | Description | Who Owns It | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| **One-page executive summary** | A single page that covers: what SG/Send is, why it matters, who it is for, how to try it. Suitable for emailing after a dinner conversation or attaching to a LinkedIn message. | Ambassador | Small |
| **Competitor encryption comparison** | Verified table showing Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud, Box encryption models. "Can the provider read your files?" for each. | Ambassador + AppSec | Medium |
| **Partner manifesto** | Standalone document for potential partners. Rules of engagement, what we offer, commercial model. Already assigned in the partner ecosystem brief but not yet produced. | Ambassador | Medium |
| **User A's quote integrated into all materials** | The quote is referenced but not yet embedded in any external-facing document. | Ambassador | Small |
| **CC BY footer on all existing materials** | Required per the partner ecosystem brief. None of the 5 for-ambassador documents have it. | Librarian + Ambassador | Small |
| **"Signal for the web" tagline testing plan** | Define how to test this tagline across different audiences. A/B test on landing page? LinkedIn post variants? Business card variants? | Ambassador + Designer | Small |

### Important Gaps (P3)

| Gap | Description | Who Owns It | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Updated competitive landscape** | The v0.3.2 competitive matrix is file-transfer focused. SG/Send has evolved to "encrypted workflow platform." The competitive frame needs updating to include data room competitors (Intralinks, Datasite), encrypted comms competitors (Wickr, Element/Matrix), and workflow competitors. | Ambassador | Medium |
| **Vertical-specific materials beyond accountants** | The accountants document proves the vertical approach works. Next verticals to address: legal (solicitors, barristers), healthcare (GP practices, NHS trusts), HR (recruitment agencies, employee data), and real estate (conveyancing, property transactions). | Ambassador + Sherpa | Large |
| **Non-English market research** | The Translator role brief hypothesised that non-English-speaking countries may be bigger markets for secure file sharing. The Ambassador should produce market sizing research for at least Portuguese, German, and Japanese markets. | Ambassador + Translator | Medium |
| **Cloud partner programme applications** | Research required for AWS APN, Google Cloud Partner, Azure Partner, and startup accelerator programmes. Assigned in partner ecosystem brief, not yet started. | Ambassador + Architect | Medium |

## Part 11: Key Decisions Needed from the Human

| Decision | Context | Ambassador Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **Should investor materials reflect the partner/open-source commercial model?** | The investor Today/Coming Soon/Future Vision documents were written before the partner ecosystem brief. They describe a SaaS-like model. The partner ecosystem brief describes a platform model. These are different business stories. | Yes. Update the investor materials. The open-source platform story is stronger and more differentiated. "Technology is free, expertise costs money" is a compelling investor pitch for this stage. |
| **Should "Signal for the web" be tested as a tagline?** | Organic user-generated framing. Strong for technical audiences. May not work for non-technical. | Yes, test it. Use it in LinkedIn posts and at the next event. Measure engagement vs the current "Send files the server can't read" messaging. Do not replace the primary headline yet. |
| **Should the agentic team story be told publicly?** | The briefing document is detailed and transparent. It reveals the team structure, the methodology, and what is hard. | Yes, but in a controlled way. Start with a LinkedIn post or conference talk, not the full 7,500-word document. Gauge the response. The story is genuinely compelling and differentiating. |
| **Which vertical after accountants?** | The accountants document is the template. Legal and healthcare are the obvious next choices. | Legal. Solicitors share the same pain points as accountants (client confidentiality, regulatory compliance, document exchange) and the regulatory framework (SRA, GDPR) maps well to SG/Send's features. |
| **Should we name competitors in external materials?** | The current documents avoid naming competitors. The Dropbox comparison from the dinner and the "what Dropbox can't do" framing are powerful but could draw attention. | Name Dropbox, WeTransfer, and Signal in informal channels (LinkedIn, conversations, business cards). Do not name them in formal investor documents. Formal documents should describe the problem ("most file sharing services encrypt at rest but hold the keys themselves") without naming names. |

## Closing Assessment

The five for-ambassador briefs represent a significant body of commercial messaging work. The investor trilogy (Today/Coming Soon/Future Vision) and the accountants vertical document are close to production-ready. The agentic team briefing is a unique asset that no competitor can replicate -- it is both a process document and a proof point.

The most important gap is not a missing document -- it is the absence of User A's quote in every external-facing material. This quote is the single most powerful piece of messaging the project has. A real user, unprompted, articulated the exact value proposition in their own words. Every document should reference it.

The industry dinner (18 Feb) and partner ecosystem brief (18 Feb) have added two new dimensions to the messaging: "Signal for the web" as a tagline, and "open source, deploy it yourself" as a commercial model. Both are stronger than what the original investor documents describe. The Ambassador's next priority is to integrate these dimensions into the existing materials and produce the missing pieces (one-page summary, partner manifesto, competitor encryption comparison).

The project now has more validated messaging than most startups achieve in their first year. The challenge is not generating messages -- it is selecting, testing, and refining them. The Ambassador recommends moving from "produce more materials" to "test what we have" in the next iteration.
