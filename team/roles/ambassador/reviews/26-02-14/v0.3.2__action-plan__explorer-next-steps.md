## Executive Summary

The MVP is live. Users understand what SGraph Send does -- they compare it to WeTransfer within seconds. That comparison is both a validation (the utility is clear) and a problem (the differentiation is not). This action plan addresses the Ambassador's two tasks from the daily brief:

1. **P1 -- Design agency kickoff:** what competitive and market positioning information the design agency needs
2. **P2 -- "Why not WeTransfer?":** competitive landscape analysis, one-line differentiators, and a market positioning strategy

The central thesis: **SGraph Send is not a WeTransfer alternative. It is a file-sharing service for people who cannot afford to trust the server.** That is a different market, with a different buyer, solving a different problem. The design agency needs to understand this distinction before they start designing.

---

## 1. Design Agency Kickoff: Positioning Input

The design agency brief (owned by Designer, supported by Architect, Advocate, and Ambassador) needs the following market positioning content from the Ambassador. This is what the agency must understand before designing a single pixel.

### 1.1 The Market Context

**What the agency must know:**

| Topic | Key Point |
|-------|-----------|
| **Category** | SGraph Send sits in the encrypted file sharing category, not the general file sharing category. This distinction drives every design decision. |
| **Primary comparison** | Users immediately compare to WeTransfer. The design must address this comparison head-on -- not by copying WeTransfer's aesthetic, but by visually communicating why SGraph Send is different. |
| **Trust is the product** | For a zero-knowledge service, the UI must communicate trustworthiness. Every visual element either builds trust or erodes it. There is no neutral ground. |
| **Verifiability is the differentiator** | SGraph Send's claims are provably true in the user's browser. The design must invite verification, not demand trust. "Open dev tools. Check cookies. Empty." is a design philosophy, not just a tagline. |
| **The vacant throne** | Firefox Send occupied this exact market position (browser-encrypted file sharing, no account required) and was discontinued in 2020. The market has been underserved since. SGraph Send is filling that vacancy with improvements. |

### 1.2 Competitive Positioning Brief for the Agency

The agency should receive a one-page competitive positioning summary containing:

1. **The competitive map** (Section 2 below) -- where SGraph Send sits relative to competitors
2. **The one-line differentiator** (Section 3 below) -- what to communicate in the first 10 seconds
3. **The three trust signals** that must be communicated visually:
   - **No cookies** -- no consent banner, no tracking, verifiable in dev tools
   - **No server-side plaintext** -- the server literally cannot read your files
   - **No account required** -- no registration, no email, no personal data collection
4. **The audience** -- who the design is for (see Section 5 for growth signals)
5. **What NOT to copy** -- do not copy WeTransfer's playful creative aesthetic. SGraph Send serves a different audience with different needs. The design should communicate competence and integrity, not creativity and whimsy.

### 1.3 Messaging Hierarchy for the Landing Page

The design agency needs to understand the message priority order:

```
Priority 1: WHAT IT DOES
"Send a file. The server never sees it."

Priority 2: WHY IT'S DIFFERENT
"Your file is encrypted in your browser before upload.
The decryption key never leaves your device."

Priority 3: WHY YOU SHOULD TRUST THIS CLAIM
"Verify it yourself. Open developer tools.
Zero cookies. Zero tracking. Zero server-side access."

Priority 4: HOW TO USE IT
[The upload/encrypt/share workflow]
```

The design must support this hierarchy. The most common mistake in security product design is leading with technical jargon (Priority 2/3) before the user understands what the product does (Priority 1).

### 1.4 Visual Trust Indicators the Agency Should Explore

| Indicator | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **"Zero Cookies" badge** | Visible on every page. Clickable. Links to verification instructions. |
| **Encryption status indicator** | Shows the user that encryption is happening in their browser, not on a server. |
| **Open-source / audit signals** | When available, display security audit results and open-source links. |
| **No consent banner** | The absence of a cookie banner IS the design statement. The agency should understand that the clean, banner-free experience is intentional and differentiating. |
| **Minimal data collection indicators** | Show what data is NOT collected (no email, no name, no IP stored in plaintext). |

---

## 2. Competitive Landscape

### 2.1 Feature Comparison Matrix

| Feature | SGraph Send | WeTransfer (Free) | WeTransfer (Pro/Ultimate) | Tresorit Send | OnionShare | Wormhole | Bitwarden Send | Internxt Send |
|---------|------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------|------------|----------|----------------|---------------|
| **End-to-end encryption** | Yes (AES-256-GCM, browser-side) | No (TLS + server-side AES-256) | No (same) | Yes (client-side E2E) | Yes (Tor-based) | Yes (AES-128-GCM, browser-side) | Yes (AES-256) | Yes (zero-knowledge) |
| **Server sees plaintext** | Never | Yes | Yes | Never | No server (P2P) | Never | Never | Never |
| **Zero-knowledge architecture** | Yes | No | No | Yes | N/A (P2P) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Account required (sender)** | No (token-based) | No | Yes | No (for basic) | No | No | Yes | No |
| **Account required (recipient)** | No | No | No | No | No | No | No | No |
| **Cookies** | Zero | Yes (functional + analytics + advertising) | Yes (extensive) | Yes (session + analytics) | N/A (desktop app) | Minimal | Yes (session) | Minimal |
| **Third-party tracking** | None | Google Analytics, advertising partners | Same | Limited | None | None | None | None |
| **Cookie consent banner** | None needed | Required | Required | Required | N/A | Not needed | Required | Minimal |
| **Free tier file size limit** | S3-backed (no practical limit*) | 3 GB per transfer | N/A | Limited | No limit (P2P) | 10 GB | 500 MB | 5 GB |
| **Paid tier max file size** | N/A (currently free) | Unlimited (Ultimate) | Unlimited | Enterprise-scale | N/A (free) | N/A (free) | 500 MB | 5 GB |
| **File expiry** | Configurable | 7 days (free), configurable (paid) | Configurable | Configurable | When sender closes app | 24 hours | Configurable | Configurable |
| **Password protection** | Planned | Pro/Ultimate only | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | No |
| **Multilingual UI** | Yes (4 languages at MVP) | Limited | Limited | ~10 languages | Limited | English only | ~40 languages | Limited |
| **Price (individual)** | Free (MVP) | Free / $6.99-$25/mo | $15-25/mo | From ~$8.33/mo | Free (open source) | Free | $10/year | Free (limited) |
| **Open source** | No (currently) | No | No | No | Yes (GPL) | Partial | Yes (core) | Yes |
| **Mobile apps** | No (web only) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No (web only) | Yes | Yes |

*SGraph Send's practical limit is currently the browser's memory for client-side encryption. Large file support (chunked upload, streaming encryption) is on the roadmap.

**Caveat:** As noted in the [previous Ambassador review](../26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md), all competitor claims require verification before external publication. This table is for internal strategy use.

### 2.2 Pricing Landscape

| Service | Free Tier | Entry Paid | Mid Tier | Enterprise |
|---------|-----------|------------|----------|------------|
| **WeTransfer** | 3 GB/transfer, 10 transfers/month | $6.99/mo (Starter) | $15/mo (Pro) | $25/mo (Ultimate) |
| **Tresorit** | Limited free tier | ~$8.33/mo | ~$14/mo | Custom |
| **Bitwarden Send** | Text only (free) | $10/year (Premium) | $3/user/mo (Teams) | $5/user/mo |
| **Wormhole** | Free (10 GB limit) | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **OnionShare** | Free (open source) | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| **Internxt Send** | Free (5 GB) | Bundled with storage plans | Various | Various |
| **SGraph Send** | Free (MVP) | TBD | TBD | TBD |

**Market gap identified:** There is no established service that offers zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing with no account required, no cookies, no file size limits, AND a polished consumer UX. Every competitor compromises on at least one of these dimensions:
- WeTransfer has the UX but no E2E encryption
- Tresorit has the encryption but requires accounts and cookies
- OnionShare has the security but requires desktop software and Tor
- Wormhole has browser-side encryption but a 10 GB limit and 24-hour expiry
- Bitwarden Send requires an account and has a 500 MB file limit

### 2.3 The Firefox Send Vacancy

Firefox Send was discontinued in September 2020 after being abused for malware distribution. It occupied the exact market position SGraph Send now targets:
- Browser-side encryption
- No account required
- Simple, clean UX
- Free

**What went wrong for Firefox Send:** Abuse -- malicious actors used the service to distribute malware via encrypted, expiring links that were difficult to scan. Mozilla chose to discontinue rather than invest in abuse prevention.

**What SGraph Send does differently:** The token/invitation system is an architectural answer to the abuse problem. Instead of open access (anyone can upload), SGraph Send requires a token. This creates accountability without requiring personal accounts -- a middle ground between "open to everyone" (Firefox Send's vulnerability) and "account required" (Tresorit's friction).

**The positioning opportunity:** "The spiritual successor to Firefox Send, built to last." This resonates with the significant population of users who mourned Firefox Send's demise and have been underserved since 2020.

### 2.4 Competitive Threats

| Threat | Severity | Assessment |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **WeTransfer adds E2E encryption** | MEDIUM | Possible but unlikely in the near term. WeTransfer was acquired by Bending Spoons (Jul 2024) and is focused on monetisation, not security architecture changes. E2E encryption would break their abuse scanning and advertising model. |
| **Tresorit launches a simpler free tier** | LOW | Tresorit is enterprise-focused. A consumer-friendly free tier would cannibalise their paid business. |
| **A new entrant copies our position** | MEDIUM | The Firefox Send vacancy has been open since 2020. If we do not establish ourselves, someone else will. Speed to market matters. |
| **Wormhole gains traction** | LOW | Wormhole has existed since 2021 without significant growth. The 24-hour expiry and limited UX constrain adoption. |
| **Internxt Send improves** | MEDIUM | Internxt is actively developing and claims post-quantum cryptography. Monitor closely. |

---

## 3. One-Line Differentiator

### 3.1 The Problem with "Secure File Sharing"

"Secure file sharing" is what every competitor claims. WeTransfer says it is secure (TLS + AES-256 at rest). Tresorit says it is secure (E2E encryption). Even email providers claim their attachments are secure. The word "secure" has no differentiating power because everyone uses it.

The differentiator is not that SGraph Send is secure. The differentiator is that **the server never sees the file**.

### 3.2 Proposed Positioning Statements

Ranked by the Ambassador's assessment of clarity, memorability, and truthfulness:

**Tier 1 -- Primary candidates (answer "Why not WeTransfer?" in under 10 seconds):**

| # | Statement | Strengths | Risks |
|---|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **1** | **"Send files the server can't read."** | Six words. Immediately clear. Differentiates from WeTransfer (whose server CAN read files). Technically precise. Invites the follow-up "how?" | Could be perceived as a negative claim. Needs visual support. |
| **2** | **"Your files. Your key. No one else."** | Emotional. Ownership-focused. Implies zero-knowledge without jargon. | Slightly vague. Needs a subline to explain the mechanism. |
| **3** | **"Encrypted in your browser. Not on our server."** | Explains the mechanism. Differentiates from server-side encryption (WeTransfer). Technical but accessible. | Longer. Less punchy. Better as a subline than a headline. |

**Tier 2 -- Supporting statements (for subheadings, explanatory copy):**

| # | Statement | Use |
|---|-----------|-----|
| **4** | "Zero cookies. Zero tracking. Zero knowledge." | Trust signal trio. Works as a visual badge or footer element. |
| **5** | "We literally cannot read your files. By design." | Explainer copy. Addresses scepticism directly. |
| **6** | "The server stores ciphertext. You hold the key." | Technical audience. Precise and verifiable. |
| **7** | "No account. No cookies. No compromise." | Barrier-to-entry messaging. Addresses friction concerns. |

**Tier 3 -- Contextual statements (for specific audiences):**

| # | Statement | Audience |
|---|-----------|----------|
| **8** | "What Firefox Send should have been." | Developers, privacy community. Nostalgia + improvement narrative. |
| **9** | "Send files too sensitive for WeTransfer." | Enterprise, legal, healthcare. Risk-aware professionals. |
| **10** | "Open your dev tools. Check our cookies. We'll wait." | Technical users. The verifiability challenge. |

### 3.3 Recommendation

**Primary headline:** "Send files the server can't read."
**Subline:** "Encrypted in your browser. The key never leaves your device."
**Trust badges:** "Zero cookies. Zero tracking. Zero knowledge."

This combination answers "Why not WeTransfer?" in three layers:
1. **Headline** (2 seconds): the core difference -- the server cannot access your files
2. **Subline** (5 seconds): how it works -- browser-side encryption, client-held key
3. **Trust badges** (10 seconds): the proof -- no cookies, no tracking, zero knowledge

The design agency should test these with visual prototypes. The Ambassador recommends A/B testing the top 3 headlines once the landing page supports analytics.

## 4. Market Positioning Strategy

### 4.1 Where Does SGraph Send Sit?

Three possible market positions were considered:

| Position | Description | Verdict |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **A. Security-first file sharing** | "The most secure way to send files." | Partially. But "most secure" is an arms race and invites challenge. OnionShare over Tor is arguably more secure (no server at all). |
| **B. Large-file specialist** | "Send files of any size, encrypted." | Aspirational. Not yet delivered (chunked upload needed). Will become true but is not the MVP's strongest position. |
| **C. Zero-trust file sharing** | "File sharing where you don't have to trust the server." | This is the sweet spot. It is technically precise, differentiating, and does not require superlatives. |

**Recommended position: C -- Zero-trust file sharing.**

The term "zero-trust" is increasingly understood outside of security circles due to enterprise IT adoption. It communicates the right idea: the system is designed so you do not need to trust the operator. This is fundamentally different from WeTransfer ("trust us, we encrypt at rest") and even from Tresorit ("trust us, we do E2E encryption but we also set cookies and require accounts").

### 4.2 The Positioning Map

```
                    HIGH SECURITY
                         |
          OnionShare     |     Tresorit Send
          (Tor-based,    |     (E2E, accounts,
           desktop app)  |      enterprise focus)
                         |
                    SGraph Send
                    (browser E2E,
                     zero cookies,
                     no account)
                         |
  LOW ───────────────────┼─────────────────── HIGH
  FRICTION               |                    FRICTION
                         |
          Wormhole       |     Bitwarden Send
          (browser E2E,  |     (account required,
           24hr limit)   |      500MB limit)
                         |
          WeTransfer     |     Dropbox Transfer
          (no E2E,       |     (account required,
           simple UX)    |      ecosystem lock-in)
                         |
                    LOW SECURITY
```

**SGraph Send's unique quadrant:** High security, low friction. No other established service occupies this position. WeTransfer has low friction but low security. Tresorit has high security but high friction. OnionShare has high security but extreme friction (requires Tor). SGraph Send aims for the top-left quadrant: maximum security with minimum friction.

### 4.3 Three-Phase Positioning Roadmap

| Phase | Timeframe | Position | Key Message |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Phase 1: Establish** | Now -- Q2 2026 | Zero-trust file sharing | "Send files the server can't read." Build awareness in privacy and developer communities. |
| **Phase 2: Expand** | Q2 -- Q4 2026 | Zero-trust + Large file specialist | "Send files of any size. The server still can't read them." Add chunked uploads, retry, checksums. The large file capability becomes a second differentiator. |
| **Phase 3: Enterprise** | 2027+ | Enterprise zero-trust file sharing | "Your compliance team will love us. Zero cookies means zero consent headaches." Target regulated industries (legal, healthcare, finance) where compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, etc. makes zero-cookie architecture a cost savings, not just a feature. |

### 4.4 The Unencrypted Mode Question

The daily brief raises whether an unencrypted mode should exist. From a positioning perspective:

**Risk:** Offering unencrypted mode dilutes the "zero-trust" position. "Sometimes encrypted" is weaker than "always encrypted."

**Mitigation:** If implemented, position it as "direct transfer" mode rather than "unencrypted" mode. The language matters. "Send without encryption" sounds like a downgrade. "Direct transfer for non-sensitive files" sounds like an option for power users.

**Recommendation:** Default must always be encrypted. If a non-encrypted option exists, it should be deeply buried in settings, never on the main flow, and never the first thing a new user sees. The design agency should not be briefed on this option yet -- it would confuse the positioning at a stage where clarity is essential.

---

## 5. Growth Signals

### 5.1 What User Feedback Tells Us

The v0.3.2 brief contains two critical growth signals:

**Signal 1: Instant category recognition.**
> "Why are we reinventing WeTransfer?"

This means the product's utility is immediately clear. Users understand in seconds what SGraph Send does. That is a prerequisite for growth -- if users do not understand the product, nothing else matters. This signal is positive.

**Signal 2: Unprompted large-file identification.**
> "This becomes really useful for big file transfers."

A user identified the large-file use case without being prompted. This is the strongest kind of product-market fit signal: the user sees a use case the team has not yet built for, because the architecture naturally supports it. Large-file transfer is where the real pain is (1 GB+), and most services either fail, have limits, or charge premium prices.

### 5.2 Product-Market Fit Direction

The signals point to three concentric audiences, each with increasing pain:

```
Audience 1 (smallest pain, largest population):
"I need to send a file" -- general file sharing
Competitors: WeTransfer, email, Slack, WhatsApp
SGraph Send's edge: encryption, no cookies, no account

Audience 2 (medium pain, medium population):
"I need to send a SENSITIVE file" -- encrypted file sharing
Competitors: Tresorit Send, Bitwarden Send
SGraph Send's edge: no account required, zero cookies, browser-side simplicity

Audience 3 (largest pain, smallest population):
"I need to send a LARGE sensitive file" -- encrypted large file transfer
Competitors: almost none (OnionShare requires Tor, Tresorit requires accounts)
SGraph Send's edge: S3 backend (theoretically unlimited), browser-side encryption
```

**Recommendation:** Position for Audience 2 now (the MVP serves them today), build for Audience 3 next (the architecture supports it), and let Audience 1 discover SGraph Send through the viral loop.

### 5.3 Viral Loop Health Assessment

The viral loop for SGraph Send is:

```
Sender uploads file --> Recipient gets link --> Recipient downloads file
                                                      |
                                          Recipient becomes sender?
```

**Current viral loop strengths:**
- No account required for recipients (zero barrier to entry)
- The download experience exposes the recipient to SGraph Send
- The encryption narrative creates word-of-mouth potential ("I just got an encrypted file transfer -- pretty cool")

**Current viral loop weaknesses:**
- No explicit "send your own file" prompt on the download page
- No incentive for recipients to become senders
- No read receipts to close the loop for senders
- The token system creates a barrier: recipients need a token to send

**Growth experiments to run (Explorer team territory):**
1. Add a subtle "Send your own encrypted file" CTA on the download success page
2. Test whether the download page explains SGraph Send well enough for recipients to understand and want to use it
3. Measure time-from-download-to-first-send for recipients who convert
4. Consider a "recipient token" that auto-provisions limited sending capability for file recipients

### 5.4 Community Token Strategy Update

Building on the [v0.2.33 community seeding plan](../26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md):

| Token | Community | Status | Priority |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| `design-agency` | Design agency partner | NEW -- first external partner | P1 |
| `linkedin-feb` | LinkedIn post traffic | From v0.2.33 plan | P1 |
| `privacy-advocates` | Privacy-focused communities | From v0.2.33 plan | P2 |
| `security-meetup` | InfoSec meetup organisers | From v0.2.33 plan | P2 |
| `firefox-send-refugees` | Former Firefox Send users | NEW -- target the underserved | P2 |
| `large-file-beta` | Users with large file transfer needs | NEW -- validate the growth signal | P2 |

The `design-agency` token is the highest priority because, as the daily brief notes, "the design agency becomes a real user and a source of feedback." This is the first external partner -- their experience will inform both the product and the positioning.

---

## 6. Communication Strategy: Explaining Zero-Knowledge to Non-Technical Users

### 6.1 The Problem

"Zero-knowledge encryption" is meaningless to 95% of the population. "AES-256-GCM" is meaningless to 99%. "Client-side encryption using the Web Crypto API" is meaningless to 99.9%. The security is real. The communication is broken.

### 6.2 The Analogy Framework

The most effective way to explain zero-knowledge encryption to non-technical users is through physical-world analogies. Three tested approaches:

**Analogy 1: The Locked Box**
> "Imagine putting your file in a locked box before handing it to a courier. The courier delivers the box, but they never have the key. They cannot open it. They cannot see what is inside. SGraph Send works the same way -- your file is locked (encrypted) in your browser before it is uploaded. We are the courier. We deliver the box. We never have the key."

**Strengths:** Simple, intuitive, accurate. Maps directly to the actual architecture.
**Use:** Landing page "How it works" section. Design agency should create a visual version.

**Analogy 2: The Sealed Envelope**
> "When you send a letter through the post office, the postal workers could technically open and read it. SGraph Send is different. It is like sending a letter in a sealed envelope that only you and the recipient can open. Not us. Not anyone else."

**Strengths:** Familiar metaphor. Emphasises the difference from normal services (post office = WeTransfer).
**Use:** Social media, elevator pitch.

**Analogy 3: The Verification Challenge**
> "We do not ask you to trust us. We ask you to verify. Open your browser's developer tools. Look at cookies -- there are none. Look at network requests -- the file is encrypted before it leaves your device. We built SGraph Send so you do not have to take our word for it."

**Strengths:** Appeals to sceptics. Transforms distrust into engagement.
**Use:** Technical audiences, security community, blog posts.

### 6.3 Words to Use and Words to Avoid

| Use | Avoid | Why |
|-----|-------|-----|
| "Encrypted in your browser" | "Client-side encryption" | "Browser" is understood; "client-side" is jargon |
| "The server can't read your files" | "Zero-knowledge architecture" | Outcome-focused, not mechanism-focused |
| "You hold the key" | "The decryption key never leaves the user's device" | Ownership language is empowering |
| "No cookies" | "Cookieless architecture" | Simple, concrete, verifiable |
| "No account needed" | "Frictionless authentication" | Describes the user's experience, not the engineering |
| "Verify it yourself" | "Trustless verification" | Invites action rather than using crypto jargon |
| "We're the courier, not the reader" | "We never decrypt server-side" | Analogy over mechanism |

### 6.4 Communication Channels and Message Mapping

| Channel | Audience | Message Focus | Format |
|---------|----------|--------------|--------|
| **Landing page** | All visitors | "Send files the server can't read." + locked box analogy | Visual, above the fold |
| **LinkedIn** | Professionals, network | Use case stories ("I needed to send a contract securely...") | Posts with screenshots |
| **Hacker News** | Developers, technical | Architecture explanation, IFD methodology, Firefox Send comparison | Show HN with technical detail |
| **Reddit (r/privacy, r/degoogle)** | Privacy enthusiasts | Zero-cookie claim, dev tools verification challenge | Text post with evidence |
| **InfoSec conferences/meetups** | Security professionals | Architecture review, threat model, invitation to audit | Presentation or whitepaper |
| **Design agency** | Creative professionals | "Secure file sharing for client deliverables" | Direct demo, partnership token |

## 8. Coordination Requests

| To | Request | Context |
|----|---------|---------|
| **Designer** | Include Sections 1, 3.3, and 6.2 of this document in the design agency brief. The positioning input, messaging hierarchy, and analogy framework are the Ambassador's contribution to the agency kickoff. | [Daily brief P1 task](../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/14/v0.3.2__daily-brief__sgraph-send-14-feb-2026.md) |
| **Journalist** | Collaborate on the one-line differentiator. Section 3.2 provides the strategic candidates; the Journalist should refine the copy. Also: draft the "Firefox Send successor" narrative as a blog post or LinkedIn post. | P2 task from daily brief |
| **Advocate** | Review the positioning from the user persona perspective. Does "Send files the server can't read" resonate with the identified personas? Does the locked box analogy land? | Persona validation |
| **Architect** | Confirm that the competitive claims in Section 2.1 are technically accurate from SGraph Send's side. Specifically: confirm that the server never sees plaintext, confirm zero cookies, confirm no third-party tracking. | Claims must be defensible before any external use |
| **AppSec** | Same verification as Architect, from the security perspective. The Ambassador will not publish any competitive comparison until AppSec confirms our own claims. | [Continuing from v0.2.33 request](../26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md) |
| **Dev** | Prioritise the `design-agency` token. The design agency is our first external partner and should be onboarded using our own product. | Agency becomes a real user |
| **Sherpa** | Coordinate on viral loop experiment design (Action #7). The Sherpa's friction log from first-user testing will inform where the download-to-sender conversion breaks. | Growth depends on the viral loop |

## 9. Risk Register Update

| Risk | Severity | Change from v0.2.33 | Mitigation |
|------|----------|---------------------|------------|
| **"Why not WeTransfer?" goes unanswered** | HIGH | NEW | This action plan. Positioning statements ready for testing. Agency briefed on differentiation. |
| **Design agency produces WeTransfer-like design** | HIGH | NEW | Provide clear positioning input (Section 1). Emphasise "do not copy WeTransfer" in the brief. |
| **Competitive claims inaccurate** | HIGH | Unchanged | Fact-check before external publication. Internal use only until verified. |
| **Large-file promise made before delivery** | MEDIUM | NEW | Do not position as a large-file service until chunked upload ships. Reference it as a roadmap item, not a current feature. |
| **Firefox Send comparison invites abuse concerns** | MEDIUM | NEW | Proactively address how the token system prevents the abuse that killed Firefox Send. |
| **Internxt Send emerges as direct competitor** | MEDIUM | NEW | Monitor their roadmap. They are the closest competitor in terms of positioning (free, encrypted, no account, browser-based). |

## Summary

The Ambassador's Explorer-team contribution for v0.3.2 centres on two deliverables:

1. **Design agency positioning input** (P1): Sections 1, 3.3, and 6.2 of this document provide the competitive context, messaging hierarchy, and communication strategy the design agency needs before designing.

2. **"Why not WeTransfer?" answer** (P2): The competitive landscape analysis (Section 2), one-line differentiators (Section 3), and market positioning strategy (Section 4) give the team a clear, defensible answer.

The recommended primary headline -- **"Send files the server can't read."** -- answers "Why not WeTransfer?" in six words. WeTransfer's server can read your files. SGraph Send's cannot. That is the difference. Everything else -- zero cookies, no account, browser-side encryption -- supports and proves that core claim.

The Explorer team's next step is to test this positioning with the design agency engagement and with landing page experiments. The Villager team should not touch positioning -- that remains Explorer territory until the messaging is validated.
