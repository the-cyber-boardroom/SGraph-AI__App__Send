## Context Since Last Activity

### What the Sherpa Last Produced (14 Feb)

The Sherpa's last output was the v0.3.2 Explorer action plan (30KB), covering six workstreams:
1. **Read receipts design** — detailed gap analysis (G-RR-01 through G-RR-05) quoting actual Python code from `Transfer__Service.py`, identifying specific gaps in `Middleware__Analytics`
2. Multi-file upload UX design
3. Design agency observation plan
4. Large file transfer UX
5. Admin workflow trail continuation
6. Carried-forward items from v0.3.0

### Key Project Changes (v0.3.2 -> v0.4.8)

1. **Strategic pivot (D038):** SG/Send is now an "encrypted workflow platform", not just file transfer. This creates entirely new user journeys for the Sherpa to map — recipients now interact with forms, approval interfaces, and review tools, not just download links.

2. **Interactive encrypted data workflows:** Three use cases:
   - Translation review: structured JSON with approve/edit/reject per string
   - Client-side translation as product: recipient gets content in their language
   - General-purpose encrypted workflows: document approval, surveys, code review

3. **UI component library:** 13 components defined for interactive workflows. Each component is a new UX surface area that the Sherpa needs to assess for user friction.

4. **Translator role + non-English market:** Non-English-speaking users are a target audience. This introduces new persona types (non-English speakers using encrypted workflows) that the Sherpa's persona-aware guidance must address.

5. **Two-team operation:** Explorer builds new features; Villager handles production. The Sherpa operates primarily on Explorer team — observing user behaviour on new features.

### Sherpa-Specific Impact

- **New user journeys to map:** Interactive encrypted workflows create a fundamentally different user journey: sender structures data → encrypts → sends → recipient decrypts → sees interactive UI → interacts → response encrypted → sent back. This is more complex than the current upload/download flow.
- **Friction prediction:** The concept of encrypted interactive workflows is unfamiliar territory for users. The "key management + split-channel concept" friction (from the original journey map) is now compounded by "interactive forms that appear from encrypted data" — a concept that may confuse or delight users.
- **Trail observation expansion:** New telemetry points needed for interactive workflow stages: schema rendering time, form interaction patterns, response submission, round-trip completion.
- **Read receipts gap analysis still relevant:** The G-RR-01 through G-RR-05 gaps identified in Feb 14 are still open and apply to the new workflow model too.

### Pending Tasks from v0.4.4 Debrief

| Priority | Task | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| LOW | No immediate action; will feed into Journalist when SA data available | Per v0.4.4 debrief |

**Note:** The v0.4.4 debrief listed the Sherpa as "should NOT be active" for Explorer. The human stakeholder is now explicitly activating this role.

## Ready For Task

The Sherpa is ready to receive task assignment from the human stakeholder. Current capabilities:

- **User journey mapping** — end-to-end flow analysis with friction points identified
- **Friction logging** — structured friction data (who, where, what, expected, actual, resolution)
- **Trail observation** — behavioural analysis from logs and telemetry
- **Onboarding design** — first-time user experience for new features
- **Side effect detection** — post-release behavioural change analysis
- **Friendlies programme** — beta user onboarding and guidance (jointly with Ambassador)
- **Persona-aware guidance** — adapted support for different user types
