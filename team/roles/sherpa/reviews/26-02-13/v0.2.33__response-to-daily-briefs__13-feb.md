## 1. Token Onboarding Trail Design

**Brief reference:** "Sherpa: this is a key onboarding moment -- the first time a waiting list user activates. Track the trail."

### The Moment

A person on the waiting list receives an email or message containing a URL with an embedded token. They click the link. This is the most consequential moment in our user funnel: a passive lead becomes an active user. Everything about this moment must be intentional.

### The Ideal Onboarding Flow

```
WAITING LIST USER RECEIVES TOKEN URL
    |
    v
STEP 1: User clicks the URL
    - URL format: send.sgraph.ai/?token=community-x (token in query string, not hash)
    - Server sees the token in the URL (Decision D019)
    - Trail event: token.activate (ip_hash, token_hash, referrer, timestamp)
    |
    v
STEP 2: Token validation
    - Server hashes the token string -> cache hash -> resolves to cache entry
    - Checks: is the token valid? Has it exceeded its usage limit?
    - If valid: increment usage count, record event, proceed
    - If invalid/exhausted: show a clear, guiding error (see below)
    - Trail event: token.validate (token_hash, valid, usage_count, usage_limit)
    |
    v
STEP 3: First impression (CRITICAL)
    - The user lands on the upload page with the token already activated
    - The access gate should NOT appear (the token was in the URL)
    - Instead, show a WELCOME state: "Welcome to SGraph Send"
    - Brief explanation: "You can now send encrypted files. Here's how:"
    - 3-step visual guide: (1) Choose a file or text, (2) We encrypt it, (3) Share the link
    - A clear "Try it now" call to action
    - Trail event: gate.token.auto_activate (ip_hash, token_hash, timestamp)
    |
    v
STEP 4: Guided first upload
    - The user selects a file or enters text
    - If this is a friendlies user, consider pre-populating text mode with a sample
    - Trail event: first_use.file_select or first_use.text_input
    |
    v
STEP 5: First share
    - After the upload completes, the sharing UI appears
    - For first-time users, add a contextual tooltip: "Copy this link and send it to your recipient"
    - Trail event: first_use.share (method: combined/link_only/email_copy/gmail)
    |
    v
STEP 6: Post-onboarding
    - Store the token in localStorage so the user does not need to re-enter it
    - On subsequent visits, skip the welcome state and go directly to upload
    - Trail event: returning_user.page_load (ip_hash, token_hash)
```

### Error States in the Token Flow

| Error | User sees | Trail event |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Token not found (hash does not resolve) | "This invitation link is not valid. If you received this from someone, please ask them to check the link." | `token.error.not_found` |
| Token exhausted (usage >= limit) | "This invitation has reached its usage limit. Sign up for the waiting list to get your own access." + LaunchList form | `token.error.exhausted` |
| Token expired (if we add time-based expiry) | "This invitation has expired. Sign up for the waiting list to get new access." + LaunchList form | `token.error.expired` |

### Key Design Principle

The token URL should work as a **self-contained onboarding experience**. The user should not need to know what a "token" is. They click a link, they land on a page that says "Welcome", they understand what to do, and they do it. The token is invisible infrastructure.

### Trail Data for Token Onboarding

| Metric | What it reveals |
|--------|----------------|
| Token activation rate | What % of distributed tokens get clicked? |
| Token-to-first-transfer rate | What % of activated tokens result in a completed transfer? |
| Time from activation to first transfer | How long does onboarding take? |
| Welcome page to first file select | Are users reading the welcome content or jumping straight in? |
| Token error rate | Are we distributing bad tokens? |
| Token exhaustion events | Which communities are using their allocation? |

## 2. Domain Preference Research Question

**Brief reference:** "Advocate + Sherpa: capture this as a persona/user research question"

### The Question

A real user immediately asked "why .ai?" -- indicating that the .ai TLD creates an expectation of AI functionality that SGraph Send does not provide. Both `sgraph.ai` and `sgraph.com` are available.

### Research Design

**Question set for friendlies programme feedback form:**

1. **"When you first saw `send.sgraph.ai`, what did you expect the service to do?"** (Open-ended. Captures whether .ai creates AI expectations.)

2. **"Which URL would you trust more for sending sensitive files?"**
   - `send.sgraph.ai`
   - `send.sgraph.com`
   - No difference
   (Single choice. Captures trust perception.)

3. **"Does the .ai in the URL make you think the service uses artificial intelligence?"**
   - Yes
   - No
   - Not sure
   (Single choice. Direct measure of AI expectation.)

4. **"Which URL is easier to remember?"**
   - `send.sgraph.ai`
   - `send.sgraph.com`
   - No difference
   (Single choice. Captures memorability.)

5. **"If this service stores no data about you and uses no AI features, does the .ai domain feel misleading?"**
   - Yes, it's misleading
   - A little, but it doesn't matter
   - No, it's fine
   (Single choice. Measures whether .ai creates a trust gap.)

### When to Ask

Include in the post-first-use feedback questionnaire for the friendlies programme. Do NOT ask before the user has completed their first transfer -- we want their answer to be informed by the actual experience, not just the URL.

### How to Track

Create a cache entry for each feedback response: `cache/feedback/{feedback_id}/domain_preference.json`. Aggregate by question for analysis.

### Sherpa's Preliminary Assessment

The .ai domain has a practical advantage: it is short, memorable, and visually clean (`send.sgraph.ai` reads naturally). The AI expectation is a real risk, but it may be addressable through clear product messaging on the landing page rather than a domain change. The research question will provide data to make this decision.

### Cross-references

- Advocate: persona definitions should include domain trust expectations
- Ambassador: market positioning implications
- Journalist: landing page copy should preemptively address "this is not an AI service" if the research confirms confusion

## 3. Event Data UX Review

**Brief reference:** "Sherpa: this is trail data made visible to the user -- review from a UX perspective"

### Context

The brief proposes exposing file event data in the UI: views, downloads, activity timestamps. This is both a utility feature (sender gets visibility) and a trust feature (transparency about what we track).

### UX Recommendations

#### What to Show

| Data Point | Show to Sender? | Show to Recipient? | UX Reasoning |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Total view count | Yes | No | Sender wants to know if the link was opened. Recipient does not need to know how many others viewed it. |
| Total download count | Yes | Yes (own count only) | Sender wants to know if the file was downloaded. Recipient sees "Downloaded 1 time" as confirmation their download was recorded. |
| Last activity timestamp | Yes | No | Sender wants to know the most recent activity. Useful for checking if recipient has acted. |
| Event timeline (detailed) | Yes (behind "Show details" toggle) | No | Power users may want the full timeline. Hide it behind a toggle to avoid overwhelming casual users. |
| IP hashes of accessors | NO | NO | Even hashed, IP information is not useful to end users and may create confusion or anxiety. This is for admin/sherpa analysis only. |
| Content type | Yes | Yes | Helps confirm "this is the right file" |
| File size | Yes | Yes | Helps confirm "this is the right file" |

#### How to Show It

**For the sender (post-upload screen):**

```
Your file has been encrypted and uploaded.

Share this link: [link]  [Copy link]

--- Activity ---
Views: 3
Downloads: 1
Last activity: 13 Feb 2026, 14:32 UTC

[Show detailed timeline]
```

The activity section should update periodically (poll every 30 seconds when the page is open) or use a "Refresh" button. Do NOT auto-refresh with animation -- it is distracting.

**For the recipient (download page):**

```
Encrypted file -- 2.4 MB
Uploaded 13 Feb 2026, 10:15 UTC
Downloaded 2 time(s)
```

This is already partially implemented in the current download component (`renderTransferInfo()` shows download count). The Sherpa recommends keeping this minimal for recipients.

#### What NOT to Show

1. **Do not show IP hashes to users.** They are meaningless to non-technical users and anxiety-inducing to privacy-conscious users.
2. **Do not show real-time "someone is viewing your file right now" notifications.** This crosses from transparency into surveillance-feeling territory.
3. **Do not show the detailed event timeline by default.** Put it behind a toggle. Most users only care about the summary (views, downloads, last activity).

#### Transparency Alignment

The event data display should be consistent with the transparency panel. The transparency panel says "Here is what we stored." The event data display says "Here is what happened." Both build trust through visibility.

**Recommended placement:** The event data should appear ABOVE the transparency panel on the sender's post-upload screen. The flow should be: success message, share link, activity summary, transparency panel. The event data answers "What happened to my file?" and the transparency panel answers "What do you know about me?"

### Cross-references

- DPO: confirm that showing download counts does not enable re-identification of recipients
- Dev + Designer: implement event data display following these UX guidelines
- Architect: confirm that the cache service event aggregation supports the proposed data points

## 4. Sharing Method Tracking Plan

**Brief reference:** "Sherpa: track which sharing method users prefer (copy text vs Gmail link)"

### What to Track

Once the email sharing options are implemented (Brief #1, P2), we need to measure which methods users choose:

| Sharing Method | Trail Event | When Logged |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Copy combined link | `share.method.copy_combined` | User clicks "Copy link" button |
| Copy text (email template) | `share.method.copy_text` | User clicks "Copy as text" button |
| Open in Gmail | `share.method.gmail_link` | User clicks "Open in Gmail" button |
| Copy link only (separate) | `share.method.copy_link_only` | User clicks "Copy" on link-only field |
| Copy key only (separate) | `share.method.copy_key` | User clicks "Copy" on decryption key field |

### Metrics to Derive

| Metric | Computation | What It Reveals |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Primary sharing method distribution | Count of each `share.method.*` event / total share events | Which method is most popular |
| Split-channel rate | `(copy_link_only + copy_key) / total share events` | % of users who choose higher security |
| Email vs clipboard rate | `(copy_text + gmail_link) / (copy_combined + copy_text + gmail_link)` | Whether users prefer integrated email or manual paste |
| Gmail vs generic email | `gmail_link / (copy_text + gmail_link)` | Gmail market share among our email-sharing users |
| No-share rate | `transfer.complete` events with no subsequent `share.method.*` | % of users who complete upload but never copy the link (concerning) |

### Segmentation

Track sharing method preference segmented by:

1. **Persona type:** First-time vs returning user (inferred from token activation vs returning_user events)
2. **Content type:** File vs text (users may share text differently than files)
3. **File size:** Small (<1MB) vs large (>1MB) -- larger files may warrant more formal sharing
4. **Device:** Mobile vs desktop (inferred from user-agent) -- mobile users may prefer different methods

### Implementation Note

The sharing method tracking requires client-side events to be communicated to the server. Since we have no client-side analytics (zero cookies, no GA), the tracking must happen via explicit API calls when the user clicks a sharing button. This is a deliberate user action, not passive tracking.

**Proposed approach:** When the user clicks any sharing button, the component fires a `POST /transfers/event/{transferId}` request with `{event_type: "share", method: "copy_combined"}`. This is logged as a trail event in the cache service.

### Cross-references

- Dev: implement the sharing method event recording
- Architect: confirm the event recording API endpoint design
- Ambassador: sharing method data feeds the viral loop analysis
- QA: each sharing method should be tested with synthetic users using different themes (per Brief #1)

## 5. No-Cookie Policy UX Implications

**Brief reference:** Brief #2 introduces the zero-cookie policy (Decision D025). The Sherpa assesses the UX implications.

### What It Means for Users

1. **No cookie banners.** This is a direct UX win. Users will not see a consent popup, a cookie wall, or a "manage preferences" button. The page loads clean.

2. **No persistent tracking.** Users cannot be tracked across sessions by the server. Each visit is independent (unless they have a token stored in localStorage).

3. **No "remember me" from the server side.** The server has no mechanism to recognize a returning user. If the user clears their localStorage (where the access token is stored), they must re-enter their token.

4. **Provable privacy claim.** The Sherpa can use this as a trust-building statement in onboarding: "This site uses no cookies. None. We can prove it." This is not just marketing -- it is a verifiable technical fact.

### UX Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Users expect persistent state but get none | LOW | The access gate stores the token in localStorage. For most users, the experience is indistinguishable from cookie-based auth. |
| Clearing browser data logs the user out | LOW | This is expected behaviour for privacy-conscious users. Add a note in the transparency panel: "Your access token is stored in your browser's local storage. Clearing browser data will remove it." |
| No session continuity across devices | MEDIUM | A user who signs up on their laptop cannot seamlessly continue on their phone. The token must be re-entered. This is a feature, not a bug, for a zero-knowledge service -- but it should be explained. |
| Analytics loss compared to GA | NONE (for users) | The user experience is strictly better without GA: faster page loads, no consent flows, no third-party scripts. The analytics loss is an internal concern, addressed by server-side analytics. |

### What the Sherpa Recommends

1. **Add "No cookies" to the landing page.** Make it a visible feature, not a hidden policy. Suggested placement: near the "zero-knowledge" explanation. Example: "No cookies. No tracking scripts. No consent banners. We don't need them because we don't track you."

2. **Update the transparency panel.** Add a row: "Cookies: None (this site uses no cookies)." This reinforces the claim at the point where users are reviewing what is stored.

3. **Explain localStorage usage clearly.** The transparency panel (or a linked "What we store locally" panel per Brief #2) should explain: "We store your access token and language preference in your browser's local storage. This data never leaves your device. You can clear it at any time."

4. **Test the no-cookie claim.** QA should verify that no cookies are set, from any source, on any page. This is a claim we make publicly and must be able to defend.

### Cross-references

- DPO: formal GA removal recommendation delivered (Decision D024)
- Journalist: "no cookies" copy for landing page and privacy policy
- AppSec: confirm no third-party scripts set cookies (including LaunchList widget)
- QA: cookie verification test (zero cookies on all pages)

## 6. Transparency Panel Guidance

**Brief reference:** Brief #2 proposes a local storage transparency panel. The Sherpa provides guidance on how to present this to users.

### The Principle: "Open the Hood"

The transparency panel exists to say: "Here is exactly what is inside. Nothing is hidden." This is a trust-building feature for privacy-conscious users. The Sherpa's job is to make this feel safe, not technical.

### Content States

The transparency panel should have different content depending on the context:

#### State 1: After Upload (Sender)

```
What we stored about this transfer
------------------------------------
Your IP address     [hashed value]
Upload time         13 Feb 2026, 10:15 UTC
File size           2.4 MB

What we did NOT store
------------------------------------
File name           NOT stored
File content        Encrypted (we cannot read it)
Decryption key      NOT stored (only you have it)

That's everything. Nothing else is captured.
```

**Sherpa guidance note:** This state is already implemented in `send-transparency.js` (v0.1.0). It is functional but needs two improvements: (a) internationalisation (Friction F011), and (b) a friendlier tone. "That's everything" is good. Consider adding: "Want to know more? [Link to privacy policy]."

#### State 2: After Download (Recipient)

```
What was stored about your download
------------------------------------
Download time       13 Feb 2026, 14:32 UTC
File size           2.4 MB

What was NOT stored
------------------------------------
File name           NOT stored
File content        Encrypted (only you could read it)
Decryption key      NOT stored (it was in your link)

That's everything. The sender cannot see who you are.
```

**Sherpa guidance note:** The final line ("The sender cannot see who you are") is critical for recipient trust. Recipients may worry that the sender is tracking them. Explicitly state that this is not possible.

#### State 3: Local Storage Panel (New -- from Brief #2)

```
What's stored in your browser
------------------------------------
Access token        beta-community-x
Language            English
Theme               Default (Aurora)

What's NOT stored locally
------------------------------------
Encryption keys     NOT cached (your choice)
File content        Never stored locally
Browsing history    Not tracked

[Clear all local data]  [Change preferences]
```

**Sherpa guidance note:** This panel should be accessible from a persistent UI element (a small "Storage" or "Privacy" link in the footer or header). It should NOT be a modal popup -- users should be able to access it at any time without interrupting their workflow.

#### State 4: Zero Local Storage Mode (Future -- Brief #2)

```
Zero storage mode is active
------------------------------------
Nothing is stored in your browser.
Every visit is completely fresh.
You will need to re-enter your access token each time.

[Switch to standard mode]
```

**Sherpa guidance note:** This mode is for maximum-privacy users. The Sherpa recommends NOT making this the default -- it adds friction (re-entering the token every time). But it should be available as an explicit choice in the local storage panel.

### User Guidance Flow

When a user first encounters the transparency panel, they need to understand three things:

1. **What the server knows** (upload time, file size, hashed IP -- not the file content, not the filename, not the key)
2. **What their browser stores** (access token, language, theme -- not encryption keys by default)
3. **What they can control** (clear local data, switch to zero-storage mode, choose whether to cache keys)

The Sherpa recommends a progressive disclosure approach:

- **Level 1 (default):** Show the per-transfer transparency panel after upload/download. This is already implemented.
- **Level 2 (on demand):** Show the local storage panel when the user clicks "What's stored in your browser?" link.
- **Level 3 (deep dive):** Link to the full privacy policy for users who want the complete picture.

### Internationalisation Requirements

All transparency panel strings must go through the i18n system. This includes:

- "What we stored about this transfer" and all field labels
- "NOT stored", "Encrypted (we cannot read it)", etc.
- "That's everything. Nothing else is captured."
- All strings in the local storage panel
- Error states and action buttons

Current gap: the `send-transparency.js` component (v0.1.0) has hardcoded English strings (Friction F011). This must be updated before the friendlies programme, since we anticipate Portuguese-speaking friendlies.

### Cross-references

- DPO: review transparency panel content for accuracy and compliance
- Designer: design the local storage panel UI
- Dev: implement the updated transparency panel with i18n support
- AppSec: 7 conditions for local key caching (Decision D030) must be reflected in the panel
- Journalist: write the final copy for all panel states

---

## 7. Sherpa's Overall Assessment

### What is working well

1. **The core flow works.** Upload, encrypt, share, download, decrypt -- the end-to-end pipeline is functional. The first real user confirmed this.
2. **Hash-fragment URLs are a major improvement.** The shift from two-part sharing (link + key separately) to a single combined URL dramatically reduces friction.
3. **The transparency panel is a differentiator.** No competitor shows users what the server stores. This builds trust with privacy-conscious users.
4. **The i18n foundation is in place.** v0.1.3 has a working translation system. All new content should go through it from day one.
5. **The no-cookie policy is a UX win.** Removing GA and consent banners makes the page cleaner and faster.

### What needs immediate attention

1. **The landing page does not explain itself.** This is the single highest-friction issue (F001). Every new user will hit this. The explanatory content must land before the friendlies programme begins.
2. **The download filename is "download".** This degrades every recipient's experience (F005). It is a solvable problem -- even a content-type-based extension would help.
3. **Trail observation infrastructure does not exist yet.** The Sherpa cannot observe trails until the cache service is implemented and trail events are being recorded. This is the gating item for all Sherpa analytics work.

### Readiness for friendlies programme

The product is **not ready** for unguided friendlies. The Sherpa can guide individual users through the flow manually (as the project lead did with the first user), but the product cannot stand on its own. Before the friendlies programme can launch at scale:

- Landing page must explain the service (F001)
- Token onboarding flow must work seamlessly (token URL -> welcome -> upload)
- Trail observation must be recording data
- Error messages must guide recovery (F009)

The Sherpa estimates that the friendlies programme can begin once the Dev's Phase 2 tasks are complete (hash-fragment URLs, i18n, landing page content, token system core).
