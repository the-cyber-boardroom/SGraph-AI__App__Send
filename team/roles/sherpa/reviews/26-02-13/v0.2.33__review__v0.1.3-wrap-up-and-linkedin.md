**Date:** 13 February 2026
**Role:** Sherpa
**Follows:** [First-Time User Journey Map & Friction Log](v0.2.33__first-time-user-journey-map-and-friction-log.md) | [Trail Observation Plan](v0.2.33__trail-observation-plan.md) | [Response to Daily Briefs](v0.2.33__response-to-daily-briefs__13-feb.md)

## 1. Friction Resolution Scorecard

The Sherpa identified 13 friction points during the first activation. Three UI versions shipped in this session (v0.1.1, v0.1.2, v0.1.3). Below is the before/after assessment for every friction point.

### Resolution Table

| ID | Friction Point | Severity | Stage | v0.1.1 | v0.1.2 | v0.1.3 | Current Status |
|----|---------------|----------|-------|--------|--------|--------|----------------|
| **F001** | No explanation of what the service does | HIGH | S1 (Land) | -- | -- | -- | **OPEN.** No onboarding content shipped. The landing page still has only the subtitle "Zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing." This remains the single highest-friction issue. Journalist copy exists but has not been integrated. |
| **F002** | Too many sharing steps (split-channel) | HIGH | S6 (Share) | **RESOLVED.** Hash-fragment URLs shipped (Decision D014). Combined link `#{transferId}/{key}` is now the primary sharing mechanism. Split-channel preserved as optional toggle. | Carried forward | Carried forward | **RESOLVED.** The core friction -- needing to copy link AND key separately -- is eliminated. Residual: no email/Gmail sharing buttons yet. |
| **F003** | Download link not drag-and-droppable | MEDIUM | S6 (Share) | -- | -- | -- | **OPEN.** The result link is still rendered as a `<span>`, not an `<a>` element. Quick fix not yet picked up. |
| **F004** | Domain confusion (.ai) | LOW | S1 (Land) | -- | -- | -- | **OPEN (by design).** This is a research question, not a bug. Sherpa designed a 5-question survey for the friendlies programme (see [Response to Daily Briefs, Section 2](v0.2.33__response-to-daily-briefs__13-feb.md)). No action needed until data is collected. |
| **F005** | Generic download filename ("download") | HIGH | R3 (Decrypt) | `a.download = 'download'` (unchanged) | `a.download = 'download'` (unchanged) | **RESOLVED.** SGMETA envelope now packages the original filename inside the encrypted payload. On decrypt, `extractMetadata()` recovers it and `saveFile()` uses `filename || 'download'` as fallback. The original filename is preserved without the server ever seeing it. Zero-knowledge model maintained. | **RESOLVED.** |
| **F006** | URL contains version path segments | MEDIUM | R1/R2 (Receive/Open Link) | URLs now use `v0.1.1` path | URLs use `v0.1.2` path | URLs use `v0.1.3` path | **OPEN.** URLs still contain `/send/v0/v0.1/v0.1.3/download.html#...` which looks technical. No URL rewrite or short-path redirect has been implemented. IFD versioning is the root cause and cannot be removed -- but a clean alias (`/d/{id}`) layered on top would solve the user-facing issue. |
| **F007** | No explanation of zero-knowledge concept | MEDIUM | S1, S4, R2 | -- | -- | -- | **OPEN.** Same root cause as F001. No educational content shipped. The only mention remains the drop zone hint: "Encrypted in your browser before upload." |
| **F008** | CTA on download page appears before download | MEDIUM | R2 (Open Link) | -- | -- | -- | **OPEN.** The "Want to send files too?" CTA is still rendered statically on page load. Has not been moved to post-download success state. |
| **F009** | No error recovery guidance | MEDIUM | S5, R3 | Hardcoded English error strings | Hardcoded English error strings | Error strings now go through i18n (`I18n.t()`), but the content is still functional, not guiding. "Transfer not found. The link may have expired." does not tell the user what to do next. | **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED.** i18n infrastructure is in place. The strings themselves still need rewriting to follow the "[What happened]. [Why]. [What to do]." pattern. |
| **F010** | Progress bar not real-time | LOW | S5 (Encrypt & Upload) | -- | -- | -- | **OPEN.** Progress still jumps between hardcoded percentages (0% -> 33% -> 66% -> 100%). Low priority -- small files are near-instant and large file support is not the current focus. |
| **F011** | Transparency panel not internationalised | LOW | S6, R4 | -- | -- | Transparency panel component (`send-transparency.js`) is still the v0.1.0 version with hardcoded English. The v0.1.3 components use i18n but inherit the same transparency component unchanged. | **OPEN.** The transparency strings are not in the i18n string tables (en.json, pt.json, pt-PT.json, tlh.json). This means a Portuguese-speaking user sees the main UI in Portuguese but the transparency panel in English. |
| **F012** | Access gate not internationalised | LOW | S2 (Authenticate) | -- | -- | Access gate component (`send-access-gate.js`) is still the v0.1.0 version with hardcoded English. | **OPEN.** Same issue as F011. Lower priority because the gate is transitional -- once token URLs work seamlessly, the gate becomes invisible for most users. |
| **F013** | Test files section on production page | LOW | S4 (Select Content) | Present | Present | Present, now with i18n strings (`test_files.title`, `test_files.description`) | **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED.** The test files section is now translatable, but it is still visible on the production page for all users. Has not been reframed as "Try it out" or hidden behind a flag. |

### Scorecard Summary

| Status | Count | IDs |
|--------|-------|-----|
| **RESOLVED** | 2 | F002, F005 |
| **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED** | 2 | F009, F013 |
| **OPEN** | 7 | F001, F003, F006, F007, F008, F010, F011 |
| **OPEN (by design / research pending)** | 2 | F004, F012 |

### Assessment

Two of the three HIGH-severity friction points are resolved:
- **F002** (split-channel sharing) is fully resolved by hash-fragment URLs.
- **F005** (generic download filename) is fully resolved by the SGMETA envelope.

The remaining HIGH-severity friction point -- **F001** (no explanation of what the service does) -- is the biggest gap. It was identified as priority #1 in the original friction log and remains the #1 priority now. Every new user who arrives at `send.sgraph.ai` will hit this friction point.

The MEDIUM-severity points (F003, F006, F007, F008, F009) are all still open. Of these, F009 is partially addressed by i18n infrastructure -- the strings can now be translated, but they still need content improvement.

The v0.1.3 session was highly productive: it shipped foundational capabilities (hash-fragment URLs, text mode, i18n, SGMETA) that are prerequisites for resolving the remaining friction points. The infrastructure is in place; now it needs content.

## 2. LinkedIn Post as Trail Signal

### The Post

Dinis Cruz posted on LinkedIn on 13 February 2026:

> "Anybody here speaks Klingon? The latest MVP of the SGraph Send service is now available in: English, Portugues (Brasil), Portugues (Portugal), tlhIngan Hol"

Post URL: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7428147910451638272/

This is the first public social media announcement of SGraph Send with product screenshots. It features the v0.1.3 UI with the flag-based language selector visible.

### User Journey Insights from LinkedIn Engagement

LinkedIn engagement produces observable signals that map to the top of the user acquisition funnel. The Sherpa can extract the following insights:

| Signal | What It Reveals | How to Measure |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Impressions** | Reach -- how many people saw the post in their feed | LinkedIn analytics (post author dashboard) |
| **Reactions (likes, etc.)** | Interest -- the post resonated enough for an action | LinkedIn analytics |
| **Comments** | Engagement quality -- are people asking questions, expressing interest, or just amused by Klingon? | Manual review of comment content |
| **Shares/reposts** | Amplification -- the post is being distributed beyond Dinis's direct network | LinkedIn analytics |
| **"Klingon effect"** | Virality hook -- Klingon is the attention-grabber that makes people stop scrolling. It serves no product purpose but drives discovery. The question is whether Klingon attention converts to product interest. | Ratio of Klingon-related comments to product-related comments |
| **Profile views** | Secondary signal -- LinkedIn shows profile view spikes after popular posts. This indicates people wanting to learn more about the poster. | LinkedIn profile analytics (7-day trend) |
| **Click-through to send.sgraph.ai** | Conversion -- the most valuable signal. Did anyone actually visit the product? | Server-side page.load.upload events with LinkedIn referrer (currently not trackable -- see below) |

### The Attribution Gap

The critical problem: **we cannot currently attribute site visits to the LinkedIn post.** Here is why:

1. **No client-side analytics.** GA is removed (Decision D024). No tracking pixels. No JavaScript analytics.
2. **No referrer tracking.** Server-side CloudFront logs would capture the HTTP `Referer` header, but CloudFront logging is not yet enabled (pending DPO sign-off, RF-22).
3. **No UTM parameters.** The LinkedIn post links to `send.sgraph.ai` directly. No `?utm_source=linkedin&utm_campaign=klingon` parameters were appended.
4. **Hash-fragment referrer stripping.** Even if someone clicks through to a download URL, browsers do not send hash fragments in the `Referer` header.

**This means the Klingon post is generating visibility that we cannot measure.** The Sherpa flags this as a significant gap -- not because we need GA, but because the server-side trail infrastructure is not yet operational.

### Recommended Instrumentation: LinkedIn -> send.sgraph.ai -> First Transfer

The trail from "sees LinkedIn post" to "completes first transfer" spans three systems. Here is how to instrument each leg:

#### Leg 1: LinkedIn -> Landing Page

| Method | Implementation | Privacy Impact |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **UTM parameters on shared links** | When sharing links on social media, append `?ref=li` (short, clean, no PII). The server logs this as a query parameter in CloudFront access logs. | None -- `ref=li` contains no user data. It identifies the channel, not the person. |
| **Dedicated landing path** | Create `/from/linkedin` that redirects to the main page. CloudFront logs the path. No query parameters needed. | None -- it is a URL path, not a tracking mechanism. |
| **Short link** | Use a short URL service (or a self-hosted redirect) that counts clicks before redirecting. Example: `sgraph.ai/try` -> `send.sgraph.ai?ref=li` | Minimal -- the redirect service sees IP addresses, but these are not linked to the SGraph Send user. |

**Sherpa recommendation:** Use UTM parameters (`?ref=li`) for simplicity. Append them to every link shared on LinkedIn. The server logs the `ref` query parameter in CloudFront access logs. This is fully compatible with the zero-cookie policy -- it identifies the channel, not the user.

#### Leg 2: Landing Page -> Token Activation

Once a LinkedIn visitor lands on `send.sgraph.ai`, they encounter the access gate. They need a token.

**Options for LinkedIn visitors:**

| Strategy | How It Works | Pros | Cons |
|----------|-------------|------|------|
| **Public token in LinkedIn post** | Include a token link in the post: `send.sgraph.ai/?token=linkedin-feb` | Zero friction. Click and go. | Token can be shared beyond LinkedIn. Usage limit is the only control. |
| **Token in first comment** | Post the token link as the first comment, so it is visible but slightly less prominent. | Slightly more intentional action required. | Still public. |
| **DM on request** | "DM me for access" in the post. Send individual token links. | Maximum control. Personal touch. | High friction. Does not scale. Loses people who are curious but not committed. |
| **LaunchList signup** | LinkedIn post drives to the waiting list. Token is distributed later. | Captures email for follow-up. | Two-step process. Conversion drop-off between signup and activation. |

**Sherpa recommendation for LinkedIn traffic:** Use a **public community token** with a usage limit. Example: `send.sgraph.ai/?token=linkedin-klingon` with a limit of 50 uses. This captures the impulse visitors who see the post and want to try it immediately. The token name (`linkedin-klingon`) itself becomes a trail signal -- every activation of this token is attributable to the LinkedIn post.

When the token is exhausted, the access gate shows: "This invitation has reached its usage limit. Sign up for the waiting list to get your own access." This converts overflow traffic to the LaunchList funnel.

#### Leg 3: Token Activation -> First Transfer

This leg is entirely within the SGraph Send system and is covered by the trail observation plan (48 events defined). The key metric is **token-to-first-transfer rate**: what percentage of LinkedIn visitors who activate the token actually complete a full upload-encrypt-share cycle?

#### Complete Funnel

```
LinkedIn impressions (thousands)
    |
    v  [click-through rate]
Landing page visits (ref=li in CloudFront logs)
    |
    v  [token activation rate]
Token activations (token.activate event, token_hash matches linkedin-klingon)
    |
    v  [token-to-first-transfer rate]
Completed transfers (transfer.complete event)
    |
    v  [share rate]
Links shared (share.copy.combined event)
    |
    v  [recipient conversion rate]
Successful recipient downloads (transfer.decrypt.complete event)
```

Each transition is a measurable drop-off point. The token name ties the entire funnel to the LinkedIn post.

### Token Strategy for LinkedIn Traffic

| Parameter | Recommended Value | Rationale |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| Token string | `linkedin-klingon` | Descriptive. Self-documenting in trail data. Memorable if typed manually. |
| Usage limit | 50 | Enough for a LinkedIn post audience. If it runs out, the post is working well -- create a new token. |
| Expiry | 7 days from creation | LinkedIn posts have a ~48-hour engagement window. 7 days gives a buffer for delayed discovery. |
| Referrer tracking | Log `ref=li` from the landing URL | Confirms the visitor came from LinkedIn, not a re-shared link. |
| Welcome message | "Welcome! You found us via LinkedIn." | Personalised onboarding that confirms the user is in the right place. |

### Follow-Up Actions

1. **Retroactive:** Add a comment to the LinkedIn post with a token link: `send.sgraph.ai/?token=linkedin-klingon&ref=li`
2. **Infrastructure:** Enable CloudFront logging (blocked on DPO sign-off) so future social posts are measurable.
3. **Content:** Prepare a follow-up post for when the token is exhausted: "50 people tried SGraph Send from the Klingon post. Here's what happened." This creates a narrative loop.

## 3. i18n Impact on User Journeys

### What Changed with v0.1.3

The i18n foundation shipped in v0.1.3 introduces:
- 4 languages: English (en), Portuguese Brazil (pt), Portuguese Portugal (pt-PT), Klingon (tlh)
- 80+ translated strings across upload and download flows
- Event-driven re-rendering (`locale-changed` custom event on `document`)
- Locale persistence in `localStorage` (key: `sgraph-send-locale`)
- Flag-based language selector in the UI header

### Friction Points RESOLVED by i18n

| ID | Friction Point | How i18n Resolves It |
|----|---------------|---------------------|
| **F009 (partial)** | Error messages not guiding | The i18n system provides the mechanism to write locale-specific, context-aware error messages. The English strings are still functional rather than guiding, but the infrastructure to improve them per-locale is in place. A Portuguese user could receive a more natural error message than a literal translation of the English one. |
| **F013 (partial)** | Test files section on production | The test files section now has i18n keys (`test_files.title`, `test_files.description`), making it translatable. While it is still visible on production, translating it into the user's language makes it feel less like a developer artifact. |

### Friction Points CREATED by i18n

The Sherpa identifies the following new friction points introduced or exposed by the i18n system:

#### F014: Mixed-language experience (transparency panel)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | F014 (NEW) |
| **Severity** | MEDIUM |
| **Stage** | S6 (Share), R4 (Verify & Use) |
| **Description** | A user who selects Portuguese sees the upload/download flow in Portuguese but the transparency panel in English. The `send-transparency.js` component (v0.1.0) has not been updated to use i18n. This creates a jarring language switch at a trust-critical moment -- the transparency panel is where we say "here is what we stored about you," and saying it in the wrong language undermines the trust-building purpose. |
| **Resolution** | Update `send-transparency.js` to use `I18n.t()`. Add transparency strings to all 4 locale files. This is a direct continuation of F011. |

#### F015: Mixed-language experience (access gate)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | F015 (NEW) |
| **Severity** | LOW |
| **Stage** | S2 (Authenticate) |
| **Description** | The access gate (`send-access-gate.js`, v0.1.0) shows "Beta Access" and "Enter your access token to start sending files" in English regardless of the selected locale. If a Portuguese-speaking user has their locale set (from a previous visit), the page header says "SGraph Send" in their locale but the gate is in English. This is a continuation of F012. |
| **Resolution** | Update `send-access-gate.js` to use `I18n.t()`. Lower priority because token URL onboarding (bypassing the gate) reduces exposure. |

#### F016: Locale selector discovery

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | F016 (NEW) |
| **Severity** | LOW |
| **Stage** | S1 (Land) |
| **Description** | The language selector is a row of flag icons in the top-right corner of the page. There is no label ("Language:") or tooltip. Non-technical users may not recognise the flags as a language selector. The Klingon flag (Vulcan salute emoji) may confuse users who do not recognise it. |
| **Resolution** | Add an accessible label or tooltip. Consider adding the language name next to or below each flag for the first visit. After the user selects a language, the selector can be minimised. |

#### F017: Klingon as a trust signal (double-edged)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **ID** | F017 (NEW) |
| **Severity** | LOW (context-dependent) |
| **Stage** | S1 (Land) |
| **Description** | Klingon is included as a demonstration of the i18n architecture's flexibility. For a technical audience (LinkedIn, developer communities), Klingon is delightful and memorable. For a non-technical audience (enterprise, compliance-sensitive users), Klingon may undermine the perception of the product as serious and trustworthy. The Sherpa's concern is not about removing Klingon -- it should stay -- but about ensuring it does not appear in contexts where trust is paramount (e.g., a sales demo, a compliance review, a regulatory audit). |
| **Resolution** | Consider making Klingon available only when explicitly enabled (a "fun mode" or "developer mode" toggle) for production deployments targeted at enterprise users. For the current friendlies programme, Klingon is an asset -- keep it visible. |

### Updated Friction Map

With the 4 new friction points, the total count is 17:

| Severity | Count | IDs |
|----------|-------|-----|
| **HIGH** | 3 | F001, F002 (resolved), F005 (resolved) |
| **MEDIUM** | 6 | F003, F006, F007, F008, F009 (partial), F014 (new) |
| **LOW** | 8 | F004, F010, F011, F012, F013 (partial), F015 (new), F016 (new), F017 (new) |

### What to Watch For

1. **Mixed-language bleed.** Monitor whether users who select a non-English locale encounter English strings in unexpected places. The transparency panel (F014) is the highest-priority instance, but any hardcoded English string that escaped the i18n migration will create the same jarring experience.

2. **Locale persistence across flows.** A sender selects Portuguese, uploads a file, and shares the link. The recipient opens the link. What language does the download page appear in? Answer: English (the default), unless the recipient has previously set a locale. The sender's locale preference is not transmitted to the recipient. This is correct behaviour (locale is a per-device preference, not a per-transfer attribute), but it may surprise senders who expect their recipients to see the same language.

3. **Right-to-left (RTL) readiness.** The current i18n system handles left-to-right languages only. If Arabic, Hebrew, or Farsi are added in the future, the entire UI layout will need RTL support. The Sherpa recommends flagging this as a future architectural consideration, not a current blocker.

4. **Translation quality.** The Klingon translation was created as a proof-of-concept. The Portuguese translations should be reviewed by native speakers before the friendlies programme includes Portuguese-speaking users. Machine-translated UI strings are detectable and reduce trust.

5. **String table completeness.** The en.json file has 71 strings. The transparency panel and access gate components have approximately 15-20 additional strings that are not in the string table. Until these are migrated, the i18n coverage is roughly 80% of user-facing text.

---

## 4. Onboarding Recommendations for Next Wave

### Context

Three UI versions have shipped. The core transfer flow works end-to-end. i18n is live with 4 languages. Hash-fragment URLs eliminate the split-channel sharing friction. SGMETA preserves filenames through the zero-knowledge pipeline. Auto-decrypt removes one click from the recipient flow.

The product is significantly better than it was at the start of the session. But the Sherpa's assessment from the daily brief response still holds: **the product is not ready for unguided friendlies.**

### What "Ready for Friendlies" Means

The Sherpa defines "ready for friendlies" as: a new user, given only a token URL and no other instructions, can complete a full transfer cycle (upload, share, recipient downloads) without contacting the sender for help.

### Current Gaps Against This Standard

| Gap | Impact | Blocking? |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| No landing page explanation (F001) | User does not know what to do | **YES** -- highest-friction issue |
| No token URL onboarding flow | User must manually enter token at the gate | **YES** -- friendlies need a click-and-go experience |
| No trail observation infrastructure | Sherpa cannot measure success or detect failures | **NO** (for small cohorts -- manual observation is possible) |
| Mixed-language transparency panel (F014) | Portuguese users see English at a trust-critical moment | **NO** (cosmetic for friendlies, but should be fixed before wider rollout) |
| No error recovery guidance (F009) | User gets stuck on errors | **NO** (for guided friendlies -- the guide can help) |

### Recommended Onboarding Sequence

The Sherpa recommends a **two-phase friendlies rollout**:

#### Phase A: Guided Friendlies (5-10 people, immediate)

These are people Dinis knows personally. They receive individual attention.

**Sequence:**

1. **Personal message.** Dinis sends a direct message (WhatsApp, email, LinkedIn DM) explaining what SGraph Send is and asking them to try it.

2. **Token URL.** The message includes a personal token URL: `send.sgraph.ai/?token={personal-token}&ref=dm`. Each person gets their own token (or a small-group token with a low usage limit). This enables per-person trail observation.

3. **Guided first upload.** Dinis walks the user through their first upload -- either in real-time (screen share, voice call) or asynchronously (a short message: "Click the link, drop a file, copy the share link, send it to me").

4. **Reciprocal download.** The user sends their share link to Dinis. Dinis downloads and confirms receipt. This validates the end-to-end flow.

5. **Reverse flow.** Dinis sends a file to the user using SGraph Send. The user is now a recipient. This validates the recipient experience.

6. **Feedback collection.** After both directions are complete, send the feedback questionnaire (including the domain preference questions from [Section 2 of the daily brief response](v0.2.33__response-to-daily-briefs__13-feb.md)).

**Language targeting:** For Phase A, include at least 2 Portuguese-speaking friendlies to validate the pt/pt-PT translations. Include at least 1 person who does not speak English to test the non-English-only experience.

**What the Sherpa observes:** Manual trail observation for Phase A. Record each step timing, any confusion points, any errors, and the feedback responses. This becomes the baseline dataset.

#### Phase B: Semi-Guided Friendlies (20-50 people, after landing page content ships)

These are people who receive a token URL and minimal instructions. They should be able to self-serve.

**Prerequisites before Phase B launches:**

| Prerequisite | Status | Owner |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Landing page explains the service (resolves F001) | Not started | Journalist + Dev |
| Token URL auto-activates (bypasses gate) | Architecture delivered, not implemented | Dev |
| Trail observation records events | Not started | Dev + DevOps |
| Transparency panel internationalised (resolves F014) | Not started | Dev |
| Error messages rewritten for guidance (resolves F009) | Not started | Journalist + Dev |

**Sequence:**

1. **Token URL distribution.** Community tokens distributed via channels: LinkedIn (public token with usage limit), WhatsApp groups (group-specific tokens), email (individual or batch tokens via LaunchList).

2. **Landing page onboarding.** User arrives at `send.sgraph.ai/?token={community-token}&ref={channel}`. The token auto-activates. The landing page explains what to do: "Send an encrypted file in 3 steps: (1) Choose a file, (2) We encrypt it in your browser, (3) Share the link."

3. **Self-service first upload.** User completes their first transfer without guidance.

4. **Trail observation.** The Sherpa observes trails in real-time via the cache service. Completion rates, abandonment points, error rates, and timing are captured automatically.

5. **Feedback collection.** Automated post-first-transfer feedback prompt (in-page, not email) with the domain preference and UX questions.

6. **Cohort analysis.** After 7 days, the Sherpa produces a trail observation report comparing Phase B metrics against Phase A baselines.

### Token Allocation for Next Wave

| Channel | Token | Usage Limit | Expiry | Expected Reach |
|---------|-------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| LinkedIn (Klingon post) | `linkedin-klingon` | 50 | 7 days | 10-30 activations |
| LinkedIn (future post) | `linkedin-{topic}` | 50 | 7 days | Depends on post |
| WhatsApp (security group) | `wa-security` | 20 | 14 days | 5-15 activations |
| WhatsApp (dev group) | `wa-dev` | 20 | 14 days | 5-15 activations |
| Personal DM | `friend-{name}` | 3 | 30 days | 1 activation per token |
| LaunchList conversion | `waitlist-{batch}` | 100 | 30 days | Depends on list size |

**Total Phase B capacity:** ~250 token uses across all channels. Each channel is independently measurable via the token name.

### Onboarding Success Metrics

| Metric | Phase A Target | Phase B Target |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Token activation rate | 100% (guided) | >60% |
| Token-to-first-transfer rate | >80% (guided) | >40% |
| Time to first transfer (median) | <5 minutes | <3 minutes |
| Recipient completion rate | >90% (guided) | >70% |
| Feedback response rate | >80% (personal ask) | >20% |
| Decrypt error rate | <5% | <10% |

## 5. Summary and Recommendations

### What Went Well

1. **Two HIGH-severity friction points resolved.** F002 (split-channel) and F005 (generic filename) were the most impactful issues for the core transfer flow. Both are now fully resolved.
2. **i18n foundation is solid.** The architecture (event-driven re-rendering, lazy locale loading, fallback to English) is clean and extensible. Adding new languages is now a content task, not an engineering task.
3. **IFD methodology works.** Three versions shipped in one session, each building on the last, all previous versions preserved and accessible. Rollback is trivial.
4. **The LinkedIn post is a trail signal.** Even without instrumentation, it is generating visibility. The Klingon angle is a viral hook.

### What Needs Attention

1. **F001 (landing page explanation) is now the critical path.** Everything else is secondary. The friendlies programme cannot scale beyond guided interactions until the product explains itself.
2. **Trail observation infrastructure is not operational.** The Sherpa has designed the system (48 events, 6 primary metrics, 6 abandonment metrics, LETS pipeline) but none of it is implemented. Until the cache service is live and trail events are being recorded, the Sherpa is operating blind.
3. **Mixed-language experience (F014) will affect Portuguese-speaking friendlies.** If Phase A includes Portuguese speakers (and it should), the transparency panel language mismatch will be visible and should be fixed first.
4. **LinkedIn traffic is unmeasured.** The Klingon post is live now. Every day without instrumentation is a day of lost data. At minimum, add a token link in the comments so that click-throughs can be attributed.

### Immediate Actions (Priority Order)

| # | Action | Owner | Unblocks |
|---|--------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Add token link to LinkedIn post comments: `send.sgraph.ai/?token=linkedin-klingon&ref=li` | Dinis | LinkedIn attribution |
| 2 | Ship landing page explanatory content (resolves F001) | Journalist + Dev | Phase B friendlies |
| 3 | Implement token URL auto-activation (bypass gate) | Dev | Phase B friendlies |
| 4 | Internationalise transparency panel (resolves F014) | Dev | Portuguese friendlies |
| 5 | Enable CloudFront logging (blocked on DPO sign-off) | DevOps + DPO | All trail observation |
| 6 | Implement cache service core + trail event recording | Dev | Automated trail observation |
