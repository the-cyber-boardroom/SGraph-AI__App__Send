# v0.4.12 -- Sherpa Trail Assessment: Deliberate Token Exposure as Adoption Experiment

**Version:** v0.4.12
**Date:** 19 February 2026
**Role:** Sherpa
**Team:** Explorer
**Last active:** 26-02-17 (`v0.4.8__activation__explorer-session-17-feb.md`)
**Triggered by:** Data Controller decision to push INC-003 article with live `linkedin-user` token to `dev` branch

---

## 1. Trail Overview

The Data Controller wants to push the Journalist's INC-003 article to the `dev` branch. The article contains (in git history) the `linkedin-user` access token. Rather than rotating the token first, the controller wants to leave it active as a **controlled observation experiment** — a canary to see if anyone discovers and uses it.

This is also a **trail marker** for a much larger future path: public token sharing for gamification and advocacy-driven adoption.

The Sherpa's job is to assess the trail conditions, mark the safe path, and flag where the terrain gets dangerous.

## 2. Current Trail: Push to `dev` with Live Token

### Trail Conditions: FAVOURABLE

| Factor | Assessment | Trail Rating |
|--------|------------|:------------:|
| **Token scope** | Upload and validate only; no data access | Safe |
| **Remaining uses** | 20 of 50 — natural hard stop | Safe |
| **Data exposure** | S3 object deleted; decryption key useless | Safe |
| **Audience** | Private repo contributors only | Safe |
| **Discoverability** | Requires inspecting git history (token redacted in HEAD) | Moderate friction |
| **Reversibility** | Token can be rotated at any time to end the experiment | Fully reversible |

### Sherpa Recommendation: PROCEED

This trail is well-marked and low-risk. The 20-use hard limit is a natural safety boundary. The token can be revoked at any time. No user data is at risk (S3 deleted).

### Observation Plan

After pushing to `dev`, monitor the following to learn from this experiment:

| What to Monitor | How | What It Tells You |
|----------------|-----|-------------------|
| Token usage count | Check admin API: current 30/50 → watch for increases | Whether anyone discovered and used the token |
| Transfer list for `linkedin-user` | Check for new transfers that aren't yours | Whether someone uploaded using the token |
| Time from push to first unauthorised use (if any) | Timestamp comparison | How quickly credentials in git history are discovered |
| Download count on article (if published beyond repo) | Page analytics | Reach of the documentation |

## 3. Future Trail: Public Token Sharing for Adoption

### Trail Conditions: NOT YET SAFE — INFRASTRUCTURE GAPS

This is a much longer, steeper trail. The Sherpa has identified several sections where the trail is not yet passable.

### The Vision

```
User signs up → Gets shareable tokens → Shares on LinkedIn/WhatsApp →
Their contacts try SGraph Send → Usage tracked → Rewards for the sharer
```

This is a referral/advocacy programme powered by the token system. The tokens themselves become the distribution mechanism — no invite links, no referral codes. The product's own authentication tokens double as the growth engine.

### Why This Trail Is Exciting

1. **The token IS the product demo.** Sharing a token doesn't just invite someone — it gives them a working tool immediately. Zero friction between "I heard about this" and "I'm using it."

2. **The zero-knowledge model protects the sharer.** Even if a shared token is abused, the abuse is limited to upload quota. No one's files are exposed. The architecture naturally limits the blast radius of shared credentials.

3. **Cultural adaptability.** WhatsApp-driven distribution is natural for markets where word-of-mouth in messaging groups drives adoption (India, Brazil, Southeast Asia, Middle East). Token sharing fits this pattern perfectly.

### Trail Sections That Are Not Yet Passable

| Section | Current State | What's Needed | Priority |
|---------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| **Threat detection** | No real-time monitoring exists | Automated detection of abuse patterns (bulk upload, rapid cycling, suspicious content sizes) | **P1 — blocker** |
| **Automated response** | Manual token rotation only | Auto-revoke on abuse detection; rate limiting per token per time window | **P1 — blocker** |
| **Deployment isolation** | Single deployment serves all users | Separate deployment for "shared token" traffic; prevents abuse from impacting production users | **P1 — blocker** |
| **Token lifecycle management** | Basic use-count limit | Configurable limits per token class: shared vs private, time-based expiry, geographic scoping | P2 |
| **Sharer dashboard** | Does not exist | UI for token sharers to see: how many people used their token, uploads created, rewards earned | P2 |
| **Reward system** | Does not exist | Points, credits, extended quota, or other incentives for successful referrals | P3 |
| **Abuse reporting** | Does not exist | Mechanism for recipients to report issues with shared tokens; feeds back to sharer accountability | P3 |

### Sherpa's Trail Markers for the Future Path

**Marker 1: Start with controlled groups, not public internet.**
Before LinkedIn or public WhatsApp, test with a closed group of 10-20 trusted users. Measure behaviour, tune detection thresholds, discover unexpected usage patterns.

**Marker 2: "Shared token" should be a distinct token class.**
Don't re-use existing sender tokens. Create a new token type that is designed for sharing: higher use limits, shorter time expiry, isolated quota, tagged for monitoring. This keeps the security model clean.

**Marker 3: The reward system needs careful design.**
Rewards for sharing access credentials create an incentive to maximise distribution. This is good for adoption but creates a surface for abuse. The reward system must incentivise quality (recipients who become active users) not just volume (tokens spread widely but unused).

**Marker 4: Geographic and cultural considerations.**
Different markets have different norms around sharing credentials. What feels natural in a WhatsApp group in Brazil may feel suspicious in a corporate context in Germany. The advocacy programme needs cultural adaptation, not one-size-fits-all.

## 4. Connection to INC-003/INC-004

This decision sits at an interesting intersection:

- **INC-003** discovered that tokens were being leaked accidentally. The response was to remove them.
- **INC-004** discovered that documentation leaked data access paths. The response was containment and notification.
- **This decision** deliberately exposes a token — but with full awareness, risk assessment, and controlled conditions.

The progression is: **accidental leak → data breach → deliberate controlled exposure.** Each step taught something. The accidental leak taught us what tokens can do. The data breach taught us the boundary between credential and data exposure. The deliberate exposure tests whether we can turn a risk into a feature.

**Pattern 22: From Incident to Feature** — the security incident response process revealed a product capability. The ability to share tokens (discovered as a bug) becomes a feature (advocacy/gamification) once the proper safeguards exist.

## 5. Sherpa Summary

| Trail | Status | Recommendation |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Push article to `dev` with live token | **PASSABLE** | Proceed — low risk, natural safety limits, fully reversible |
| Public token sharing (WhatsApp/LinkedIn) | **NOT PASSABLE** | Blocked until threat detection, automated response, and deployment isolation are operational |
| Gamification/advocacy programme | **NOT PASSABLE** | Blocked until shared token class, reward system, and abuse reporting exist |

The current action is a safe first step on a longer trail. Take it, observe the results, and use the learnings to plan the infrastructure needed for the larger vision.

*Sherpa trail assessment complete. Current trail: PROCEED. Future trail: BLOCKED — three P1 infrastructure prerequisites must be built before public token sharing can begin. Pattern 22 identified: From Incident to Feature.*
