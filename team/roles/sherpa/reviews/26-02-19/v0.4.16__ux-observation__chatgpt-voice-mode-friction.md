# v0.4.16 -- Sherpa UX Observation: ChatGPT Voice Mode Friction for Data Collection

**Version:** v0.4.16
**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Role:** Sherpa
**Team:** Explorer
**Last active:** `team/roles/sherpa/reviews/26-02-19/v0.4.12__trail-assessment__deliberate-token-exposure.md`
**Triggered by:** Data Controller's experience using ChatGPT voice mode for INC-004 questionnaire

---

## 1. What Happened

The Data Controller used the AppSec voice interview brief to complete the INC-004 content sensitivity questionnaire via ChatGPT voice mode at approximately 17:00 on 19 February 2026. The interview produced a clean, structured output. The workflow works.

But three friction points were encountered before the conversation could begin.

## 2. Friction Log

### Friction 1: Voice Mode Requires Login

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **What happened** | User tried to access ChatGPT voice mode without logging in |
| **Expected** | Voice mode available to anyone with a browser |
| **Actual** | ChatGPT requires authentication to access voice mode |
| **Impact** | Must have a ChatGPT account; anonymous quick-use is blocked |
| **Severity** | Medium — for internal team use this is fine; for external users it's a barrier |

### Friction 2: Anonymous/Temporary Chat Mode Error

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **What happened** | After logging in, user tried to use ChatGPT's anonymous (temporary chat) mode with voice |
| **Expected** | Voice mode works in temporary chat (no history retention) |
| **Actual** | Error raised — voice mode did not work in anonymous/temporary mode (19 Feb 2026, ~17:00) |
| **Impact** | Cannot use voice mode without the conversation being stored in ChatGPT history |
| **Severity** | Medium-High — for sensitive interviews (breach data, personal data), history retention is a data protection concern |

### Friction 3: Paste-Then-Switch Pattern Not Obvious

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **What happened** | User discovered the working path: paste prompt as text, then switch to voice mode |
| **Expected** | Instructions should explain this clearly |
| **Actual** | The brief said "Paste the prompt... Start a voice conversation" but didn't explicitly say to paste first as text, then switch |
| **Impact** | Minor confusion; quickly resolved |
| **Severity** | Low — easy fix in future briefs |

---

## 3. The Working Path (for future reference)

```
1. Open ChatGPT (must be logged in)
2. Start a NEW standard chat (not temporary/anonymous)
3. PASTE the full prompt as a text message
4. SEND the text message (ChatGPT processes the context)
5. SWITCH to voice mode (microphone icon)
6. Begin speaking — the LLM now has the full prompt context and conducts the interview
7. When done, SWITCH BACK to text mode
8. Ask the LLM to produce the structured output
9. Copy the markdown output
```

This should be added to all future voice interview briefs as explicit step-by-step instructions.

## 4. Implications for the Voice Interview Pattern

### What Works

- The voice interview pattern is **validated for a second time** (first: User A security review interview v0.4.9, now: INC-004 questionnaire)
- Output quality is high — structured markdown, direct quotes, actionable recommendations
- Time savings are real — ~5-10 minutes speaking vs ~20-30 minutes typing detailed responses
- The LLM follows the interview script well, asks follow-ups appropriately, and produces the requested output format

### What Needs Improvement

| Issue | Fix | Priority |
|-------|-----|----------|
| Instructions don't mention login requirement | Add "You will need a ChatGPT (or Claude) account with voice mode access" to prerequisites | P2 |
| Paste-then-switch not explicit | Replace "Start a voice conversation" with the step-by-step path from Section 3 | P2 |
| No fallback for users without voice mode access | Add a text-mode alternative: "If voice mode is unavailable, simply answer the questions in the text chat" | P3 |
| Privacy concern for sensitive interviews | Add a note: "This conversation will be stored in your ChatGPT history. If the content is sensitive, consider deleting the conversation after copying the output." | P2 |

### Updated Instructions Template (for future voice briefs)

```markdown
## Instructions for the Interviewee

**Prerequisites:**
- A ChatGPT, Claude, or other LLM account with voice mode access
- A quiet environment for ~[X] minutes

**Steps:**
1. Log into your preferred LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
2. Start a **new chat** (standard mode, not temporary/anonymous)
3. **Paste** the prompt below as a text message and send it
4. **Switch to voice mode** (tap the microphone icon)
5. The LLM will greet you and begin the interview — speak naturally
6. When the interview is complete, **switch back to text mode**
7. Ask the LLM to "produce the structured output now"
8. Copy the markdown output
9. Share results via SG/Send at https://send.sgraph.ai

**Note:** This conversation will be processed by the LLM provider and may be stored
in your chat history. If the content is sensitive, consider deleting the conversation
after copying the output.

**No voice mode?** You can complete the interview in text mode instead — just answer
each question the LLM asks by typing your response.
```

## 5. Pattern Validation: Voice Mode as Data Collection Tool

| Dimension | User A Interview (v0.4.9) | INC-004 Questionnaire (v0.4.12) | Pattern Confidence |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| Duration | ~15-20 min (planned) | ~5-10 min (actual) | Scales with question count |
| Output quality | N/A (not yet completed) | High — matched template | Validated |
| Friction | Unknown | 3 friction points identified | Now documented |
| User satisfaction | Unknown | Positive — "really nice interactive interview" | Validated |
| Reuse potential | Interview format | Questionnaire format | Both formats work |

The pattern is sound. The friction is in the setup, not the interview itself. Fix the instructions, and this becomes a repeatable, low-effort data collection method.

## 6. Connection to Future Token Sharing / Advocacy

The voice mode friction is relevant to the broader advocacy strategy discussed in today's risk acceptance documents. If we're going to send tokens to people via WhatsApp and LinkedIn, we may also want to send them voice interview prompts for feedback collection. The current friction points (login required, anonymous mode broken, paste-then-switch) will affect external users even more than internal team members.

**Recommendation:** When the Advocate role designs the token-sharing advocacy programme, include a "voice feedback collection" component — but only after the instructions template (Section 4) is battle-tested with a few more internal uses.

*Sherpa UX observation. Three friction points documented. Working path identified (paste-then-switch). Updated instructions template provided for future voice briefs. Pattern validated for second time — voice mode is an effective data collection tool when the setup friction is addressed.*
