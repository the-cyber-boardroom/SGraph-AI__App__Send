# DevOps Briefing — MVP Review Response

**From:** Conductor (on behalf of Dinis Cruz)
**To:** DevOps
**Date:** 12/02/2026
**Version:** v0.2.15
**Source:** `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/12/v0.2.10__review-of-user-site-mvp.md`

## Context

The CI pipeline is now fully operational. As of v0.2.10, every push to `dev` that passes tests triggers automatic deployment of both Lambda functions to AWS. The pipeline was confirmed working (CI Pipeline - DEV #25, 1m 26s, all green):

```
Run Unit Tests (20s) → Increment Tag (8s) → Publish to PyPI (0s)
                     → Check AWS Credentials (3s) → Admin Lambda (49s)
                                                   → User Lambda (41s)
```

Dinis has also posted the working MVP on LinkedIn (end-to-end encrypted file transfer confirmed working on Lambda).

## Tasks Assigned by Review

### TASK-1: Document AWS Deployment Architecture

**Priority:** High
**Status:** Awaiting response

Document in detail how the AWS deployment is working, specifically:

1. **Pipeline flow**: How `ci-pipeline__dev.yml` and `ci-pipeline__main.yml` delegate to `ci-pipeline.yml`
2. **Lambda deployment mechanism**: The pytest-driven deployment via `tests/deploy/{Admin|User}__Lambda/deploy_aws/`
3. **AWS resources**: IAM roles, Lambda functions, Function URLs, S3 (future), CloudFront (future)
4. **Secrets management**: 7 GitHub secrets used (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`, `FAST_API__AUTH__API_KEY__NAME/VALUE`, `AUTH__TARGET_SERVER__CACHE_SERVICE__BASE_URL`)
5. **Deployment targets**: dev, qa, prod — how they differ
6. **Tag management**: Minor (dev) vs Major (main) versioning

### TASK-2: Link with DevOps Productization Brief

**Priority:** High
**Status:** Awaiting response

Cross-reference your documentation with the work defined in:
`team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/11/v0.2.4__briefs__sgraph-send-devops-deployment-productization.md`

That brief asks for:
- Repeatable, testable, destroyable, fully declarative deployment
- Class architecture: `app__deploy__aws__<component>` with `create()`, `exists()`, `verify()`, `lock_down()`, `delete()`, `verify_deleted()`
- Orchestrator for full lifecycle sequencing
- Unit tests (LocalStack) + integration tests (real AWS)
- Round-trip: create → verify → delete → verify deleted → create again

Document:
- What parts of v0.2.4 are already addressed by the current CI pipeline
- What parts remain outstanding
- A proposed implementation roadmap for the remaining work

### TASK-3: Memory-FS S3 Storage Backend

**Priority:** Medium (blocking for multi-instance Lambda support)
**Context:** The current MVP works in-memory only, meaning uploads and downloads must hit the same Lambda instance. Dinis notes: "this will be addressed once we add the Memory-FS and its S3 Storage (which I have the code for already)."

Assess:
- What S3 resources need provisioning (bucket, IAM policy, CORS)
- How this fits into the deployment orchestrator from TASK-2
- Whether the `create()/delete()/verify()` lifecycle should include S3 bucket management

## Deliverables

1. Review document: `team/roles/devops/reviews/26-02-12/v0.2.15__aws-deployment-documentation.md`
2. Cross-reference with v0.2.4 brief (in same or linked document)
3. Issues created in `team/roles/devops/.issues/` for any outstanding work items
