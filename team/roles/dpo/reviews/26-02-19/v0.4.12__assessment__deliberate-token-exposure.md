# v0.4.12 -- DPO Assessment: Deliberate Token Exposure and Future Public Sharing Strategy

**Version:** v0.4.12
**Date:** 19 February 2026
**Role:** DPO (Data Protection Officer)
**Team:** Explorer
**Continues from:** `team/roles/dpo/reviews/26-02-16/v0.4.4__evidence-pack__dpo-contribution.md`
**Triggered by:** Data Controller decision to push `linkedin-user` access token to `dev` branch; future plans for public token sharing
**Related:** [INC-004 data breach](../../historian/reviews/26-02-19/v0.4.12__incident-record__INC-004__documentation-token-leak.md), [ICO reporting assessment](../../appsec/reviews/26-02-19/v0.4.12__ico-reporting-assessment__INC-004.md), [GRC risk acceptance](../../grc/reviews/26-02-19/v0.4.12__risk-acceptance__deliberate-token-exposure.md)

## 1. Purpose

The DPO assesses two related actions from a data protection perspective:

1. **Immediate action:** Pushing the INC-003 article to `dev`, deliberately leaving the `linkedin-user` access token active (20 uses remaining)
2. **Future strategy:** Publicly sharing access tokens for gamification and advocacy-driven adoption

---

## 2. Immediate Action: Token Push to `dev`

### Data Protection Analysis

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Does the token constitute personal data?** | Arguably yes — it is linked to an identifiable sender identity (`linkedin-user`), which can be correlated to a natural person. However, the token alone does not reveal the person's identity to a third party without additional context. |
| **Does exposure of the token expose personal data of others?** | **No.** The token grants upload capability and access to transfer metadata. It does NOT grant access to file content (zero-knowledge model). The S3 object for the only known transfer with exposed decryption key (`16bff884b7da`) has been permanently deleted. |
| **Does this action create new data subjects?** | No. The token is associated with a single existing sender identity. |
| **Is this action compatible with the original purpose of data collection?** | Yes — the Data Controller is the data subject. They are exercising agency over their own credential. |

### DPO Assessment: LOW DATA PROTECTION RISK

The zero-knowledge architecture provides structural protection. Even if the token is discovered and used:
- Uploaded files are encrypted client-side before the server sees them
- The token grants no access to existing encrypted files
- Transfer metadata (IDs, sizes, timestamps) is the maximum exposure
- The token has a hard limit of 20 remaining uses

### Interaction with INC-004

This action must be assessed in the context of the ongoing INC-004 data breach:

| Concern | Assessment |
|---------|------------|
| Does this worsen INC-004? | **No.** INC-004 involved exposure of transfer ID + decryption key (data access). This action involves only the access token (platform access). The data breach vector (S3 object) is permanently closed. |
| Could this complicate the ICO assessment? | **Minimal risk.** The ICO assessment for INC-004 is about user data exposure, not credential exposure. The token is a different category of information. However, if ICO notification is required, the DPO recommends mentioning that the token remains active as a deliberate decision (not an oversight). |
| Does this constitute a new breach? | **No.** The token was already exposed in git history (INC-003/INC-004). Pushing to `dev` increases the audience but does not create a new exposure — the values are already compromised. The deliberate nature of this action, with documented risk acceptance, distinguishes it from a breach. |

### DPO Conditions for Immediate Action

| # | Condition | Rationale |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | **The INC-004 ICO assessment must be completed independently of this decision** | The ICO assessment must reflect the accidental breach, not be influenced by the subsequent deliberate action |
| 2 | **If ICO notification is required for INC-004, this deliberate action must be disclosed** | Transparency with the regulator; the deliberate exposure of the token (not the data) should be documented as a subsequent decision |
| 3 | **No new personal data may be created using the exposed token without the uploader's awareness** | Anyone using the shared token uploads their own data voluntarily; the zero-knowledge model ensures we cannot inspect it |

---

## 3. Future Strategy: Public Token Sharing

### Data Protection Implications

The future strategy introduces **significant data protection considerations** that do not exist in the current action.

### 3.1 New Data Processing Activities

| Activity | Data Subjects | Personal Data Involved | Legal Basis Required |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Token issuance for sharing** | Token holder (sharer) | Name/identifier, contact info, sharing activity | Consent or legitimate interest |
| **Tracking token usage for rewards** | Sharer + recipients | Who shared, who used, when, upload patterns | Legitimate interest (service provision) + privacy notice |
| **Gamification/reward system** | Sharers | Usage metrics, reward points, financial data if monetary rewards | Contract (reward terms) + legitimate interest |
| **Abuse detection** | All token users | Upload patterns, IP hashes, timing data, content size patterns | Legitimate interest (security) |
| **Geographic distribution tracking** | All token users | Approximate location (from IP hash patterns), cultural/market segmentation | Legitimate interest — but DPIA required |

### 3.2 DPIA Requirement

**A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is MANDATORY before the public sharing strategy launches.**

Under UK GDPR Article 35, a DPIA is required when processing is "likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons." The public token sharing strategy meets this threshold because:

1. **Large-scale processing:** Targeting multiple markets and cultural contexts
2. **New technology:** Using authentication tokens as a distribution mechanism is novel
3. **Profiling:** Tracking sharing patterns, usage patterns, and reward eligibility involves profiling
4. **Cross-border transfer:** WhatsApp/LinkedIn distribution crosses jurisdictions (GDPR, LGPD, PDPA, etc.)

### 3.3 Key Data Protection Risks for Future Strategy

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation Required |
|------|----------|--------------------|
| **Token becomes a tracking identifier** | High | Tokens must not be used to track recipient behaviour beyond the minimum needed for the service |
| **Sharing incentives create spam** | Medium | Anti-spam measures; sharing must be voluntary and not coercive; comply with e-Privacy regulations |
| **Cross-border data transfers** | High | Different jurisdictions have different rules; WhatsApp distribution in Brazil (LGPD), India (DPDP Act), EU (GDPR) each have distinct requirements |
| **Children's data** | High | If tokens are shared publicly, minors may use the service; age verification or at minimum terms of service addressing this |
| **Right to erasure complexity** | Medium | If a shared token is used by 50 people, can individual users request deletion of "their" uploads made via someone else's token? How is identity established? |
| **Reward fraud** | Medium | Incentivised sharing creates motivation for sybil attacks (fake accounts using shared tokens); privacy-preserving fraud detection needed |

### 3.4 DPO Prerequisites for Public Sharing

| # | Prerequisite | UK GDPR Article | Status |
|---|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | **DPIA completed and reviewed** | Art. 35 | Not started |
| 2 | **Privacy notice updated** for token sharing programme | Art. 13/14 | Not started |
| 3 | **Legal basis documented** for each processing activity | Art. 6 | Not started |
| 4 | **Consent mechanism** for sharers entering the programme | Art. 7 | Not started |
| 5 | **Cross-border transfer safeguards** (SCCs, adequacy decisions, etc.) | Art. 44-49 | Not started |
| 6 | **Data retention policy** for sharing activity data | Art. 5(1)(e) | Not started |
| 7 | **Rights exercise process** for shared-token users | Art. 15-22 | Not started |
| 8 | **Children's access controls** or age verification | Art. 8 | Not started |
| 9 | **Terms of service for gamification programme** | N/A (contractual) | Not started |

## 4. The Zero-Knowledge Advantage

Despite the long list of prerequisites above, the DPO notes that SGraph Send's zero-knowledge architecture provides a **structural advantage** for the token sharing strategy:

| Advantage | Why It Matters |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Server cannot inspect uploaded content** | Eliminates content moderation liability for shared-token uploads |
| **No file names on server** | Reduces personal data footprint |
| **IP addresses hashed** | Reduces identification risk |
| **Decryption keys never reach server** | Even if the token sharing system is compromised, file content remains protected |
| **Token grants upload, not download** | Shared tokens cannot be used to access other people's files |

The zero-knowledge model means the data protection risks are concentrated in the **metadata layer** (who shared, when, usage patterns) rather than the **content layer** (what was uploaded). This is a much more manageable risk profile than a traditional file-sharing service.

## 5. Decision Record

### D081: DPO Clearance for Immediate Token Exposure

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Decision** | DPO clears the push of `linkedin-user` token to `dev` branch from a data protection perspective |
| **Risk level** | Low |
| **Conditions** | INC-004 ICO assessment must remain independent; if ICO notification required, this action must be disclosed |
| **DPIA required** | No (for this specific action) |

### D082: DPIA Mandatory Before Public Token Sharing

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Decision** | A DPIA under Article 35 is mandatory before any public token sharing programme launches |
| **Risk level** | High (unmitigated) → TBD (after DPIA) |
| **Scope** | All public sharing: WhatsApp, LinkedIn, advocacy programme, gamification rewards |
| **Timeline** | Must be completed before the first public token is deliberately shared |

---

## 6. Summary

| Action | DPO Assessment | Proceed? |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Push article with `linkedin-user` token to `dev` | Low data protection risk; zero-knowledge architecture provides structural protection | **Yes — with conditions** |
| Public token sharing (WhatsApp/LinkedIn) | High unmitigated risk; DPIA mandatory; 9 prerequisites identified | **Not until DPIA and prerequisites complete** |
| Gamification/reward programme | High unmitigated risk; legal, cross-border, and children's access issues | **Not until DPIA and prerequisites complete** |

---

*DPO assessment complete. Immediate action: CLEARED (low risk, 3 conditions). Future strategy: BLOCKED until DPIA completed (Article 35 mandatory). D081-D082 logged. The zero-knowledge architecture is a structural advantage for the future strategy, but metadata-layer risks require formal assessment before public launch.*
