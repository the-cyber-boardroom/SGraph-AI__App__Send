## 1. Formal Recommendation: Remove Google Analytics

### 1.1 Background

Google Analytics 4 (GA4) was deployed to `send.sgraph.ai` and `docs.send.sgraph.ai` without a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). The v0.2.24 DPO status report flagged this and identified a P0 action: implement cookie consent or remove GA before wider launch.

Brief #2 proposes removing GA entirely and replacing it with server-side analytics. This section provides the DPO's formal analysis and recommendation.

### 1.2 Data Protection Issues with Google Analytics

#### 1.2.1 Cookies Requiring Consent

GA4 sets the following cookies on the `sgraph.ai` domain:

| Cookie | Purpose | Expiry | Consent Required? |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| `_ga` | Cross-session persistent user identifier | 2 years | **YES** -- not strictly necessary for the service |
| `_ga_*` | Session-scoped identifier (linked to measurement ID) | Session | **YES** -- not strictly necessary for the service |

Under the UK Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) Regulation 6, and the EU ePrivacy Directive Article 5(3), storing information on a user's device (cookies) requires consent unless the cookie is "strictly necessary" for the provision of the service. Analytics cookies are not strictly necessary. This is settled law (CJEU Planet49, C-673/17; ICO Guidance on Cookies).

**Currently no cookie consent mechanism exists on the site.** GA cookies are being set without consent. This is a PECR compliance violation.

#### 1.2.2 Google as Third-Party Data Processor

With GA active, Google LLC is a data processor under the GA4 Data Processing Terms. This creates the following obligations:

| Obligation | Status | Risk |
|------------|--------|------|
| **Data Processing Agreement** | Google's standard GA4 DPA applies by acceptance of Terms of Service | Adequate on paper, but DPO has not formally reviewed the specific terms against UK GDPR Article 28 requirements |
| **International data transfer** | Google processes GA data in the US (and other jurisdictions). Under the UK GDPR and the UK-US Data Bridge, adequate transfer mechanisms exist, but the legal landscape remains fragile post-Schrems II. | MEDIUM -- regulatory change could invalidate the transfer mechanism |
| **Sub-processors** | Google uses sub-processors for GA infrastructure. Controller has limited visibility into the sub-processor chain. | LOW -- standard for cloud analytics, but inconsistent with our zero-knowledge positioning |
| **Data subject rights** | Google provides a data retention and deletion mechanism via GA admin settings, but responding to individual data subject access or erasure requests for GA-collected data is operationally complex. | MEDIUM -- practical difficulty in honouring rights requests for GA data |

#### 1.2.3 Contradiction with Zero-Knowledge Promise

SGraph Send's core value proposition is: "We can't see your data." With GA active:

- Google receives behavioural data about every page visit (page URL, session duration, scroll depth, referrer, screen resolution, browser, OS, language)
- Google assigns a persistent pseudonymous identifier (`_ga` cookie) that tracks users across sessions
- This data is processed on Google infrastructure, outside SGraph's control
- Users who chose SGraph Send for its privacy properties are being tracked by a third party they did not consent to

This is not merely a technical compliance issue. It is a **trust issue**. The product claims zero-knowledge, but a third party is collecting behavioural telemetry about every user interaction. The privacy claim and the GA deployment are in direct contradiction.

#### 1.2.4 Cookie Consent Infrastructure Burden

If GA is retained, PECR requires a cookie consent mechanism that:

1. Blocks GA cookies until affirmative consent is obtained (no pre-checked boxes, no implied consent)
2. Provides a genuine choice (service must work without analytics cookies)
3. Records consent for audit purposes
4. Allows withdrawal of consent at any time
5. Re-asks consent at appropriate intervals

This requires: a consent banner UI, a consent state management system, conditional GA loading logic, consent record storage, and ongoing maintenance. For a product whose core message is "we don't track you," asking users to consent to tracking is a UX contradiction.

### 1.3 Data Protection Profile of the Replacement (Server-Side Analytics)

Brief #2 proposes server-side analytics via the cache service. From a data protection perspective:

| Property | GA4 | Server-Side Analytics (proposed) |
|----------|-----|----------------------------------|
| **Cookies** | `_ga` (2yr), `_ga_*` (session) | **None** |
| **PECR consent required** | Yes | **No** -- no cookies, no device storage |
| **Personal data collected from users** | Pseudonymous user ID, behavioural telemetry, IP (truncated) | **None from users** -- server-side events only. IP addresses hashed with SHA-256 + daily salt. |
| **Third-party processor** | Google LLC (US) | **None** -- all processing on SGraph infrastructure |
| **International data transfer** | Yes (US) | **No** -- data stays on SGraph AWS infrastructure (region-controlled) |
| **Data subject rights complexity** | High (Google's deletion mechanisms, sub-processor chain) | **Low** -- all data under SGraph's direct control. IP hashes are pseudonymised and rotate daily (cannot be linked to individuals after 24h without the salt). |
| **DPIA required** | Arguable (high-risk due to systematic monitoring via cookies) | **No** -- no personal data from users is processed. Hashed IPs are pseudonymised operational data with legitimate interest basis (security/abuse prevention). |

### 1.4 Formal DPO Recommendation

**The DPO formally recommends the immediate removal of Google Analytics from all SGraph Send properties.**

Grounds:

1. **PECR non-compliance:** GA cookies are currently set without user consent. This is a regulatory violation that must be resolved before wider launch. Removing GA resolves it permanently and without infrastructure cost.

2. **Third-party processing eliminated:** Removing GA eliminates Google as a data processor, removing international data transfer obligations, sub-processor chain visibility requirements, and the operational complexity of honouring data subject rights for GA data.

3. **Zero-knowledge consistency:** The product's privacy claim is substantiated more strongly without any third-party analytics. "We use no cookies. We have no third-party trackers. We share no data with anyone." -- every word of this becomes provably true.

4. **The replacement is better:** Server-side analytics collects no personal data from users, requires no consent, involves no third-party processor, and provides more accurate data (server-side truth, not client-reported telemetry).

5. **Cost-benefit:** The compliance cost of retaining GA (consent infrastructure, DPIA, processor documentation, ongoing audit) exceeds the value of GA data, which Brief #2 correctly identifies as inaccurate client-side telemetry that can be gamed.

**Priority: P0.** GA should be removed at the earliest opportunity. The server-side replacement does not need to be feature-complete before GA is removed -- a brief gap in analytics visibility is preferable to continued PECR non-compliance.

## 2. No-Cookie Data Protection Statement

With GA removed, SGraph Send will have zero cookies. This enables a clear, honest, and legally defensible privacy position.

### 2.1 Draft Privacy Wording (Cookie Section)

> **Cookies and Tracking**
>
> This site uses no cookies. We do not use any client-side analytics, tracking pixels, or third-party scripts. No information is stored on your device by our servers.
>
> We collect server-side operational data to maintain and secure the service. This includes:
> - **Hashed IP addresses:** Your IP address is hashed using SHA-256 with a daily rotating salt before storage. The hash cannot be reversed to recover your IP address, and the daily salt rotation means hashes from different days cannot be linked to the same user. We process this data under the lawful basis of legitimate interest for security and abuse prevention.
> - **Server-side request metadata:** Request timestamps, HTTP methods, response codes, and request durations are logged for operational monitoring. This data does not identify individual users.
>
> We do not share any data with third parties. All data processing occurs on our own infrastructure.

### 2.2 Draft Privacy Wording (Zero-Knowledge Section)

> **Zero-Knowledge Encryption**
>
> Files uploaded to SGraph Send are encrypted in your browser before they leave your device. The encryption key is generated locally and is never transmitted to our servers. We store only the encrypted ciphertext.
>
> This means:
> - We cannot read your files
> - We cannot see your file names (original file names are never sent to the server)
> - We cannot decrypt your data (we never possess the decryption key)
> - We cannot comply with requests to provide plaintext file contents, because we do not have them
>
> The encryption algorithm is AES-256-GCM, implemented via the Web Crypto API built into your browser.

### 2.3 Legal Review Notes

- The statement "The hash cannot be reversed to recover your IP address" is accurate for SHA-256 with salt, but note that hashed IPs are still personal data under GDPR (Recital 26 -- "reasonably likely to be used to identify"). The lawful basis for processing must be documented (see Section 4).
- The statement about daily salt rotation limiting cross-day linkability is accurate and should be retained -- it demonstrates data minimisation.
- The zero-knowledge claims must be verified against actual implementation by AppSec. The DPO requires AppSec confirmation that these claims are technically accurate before publication. (AppSec has previously confirmed the zero-knowledge guarantee in v0.2.24 reviews.)

## 3. Local Key Storage Privacy Review

Brief #2 proposes a transparency panel showing users what is stored locally, with optional encryption key caching in localStorage.

### 3.1 Are Encryption Keys Personal Data?

This is a nuanced question.

**Analysis:**

| Argument | For "personal data" | Against "personal data" |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Definition test** | Under GDPR Article 4(1), personal data is "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person." An encryption key, in isolation, does not identify a person. | A key is cryptographic material -- a string of random bytes. It has no semantic connection to a natural person. |
| **Linkability test** | If key + transfer ID = access to a file, and the file contains personal data, then the key is arguably "information relating to" the person who uploaded it (or the person the file is about). | The key itself does not identify anyone. The file might not contain personal data at all. The server has no way to associate a key with a person. |
| **Contextual assessment** | In the user's browser, the key is associated with their browsing activity. Combined with the transfer ID (also in localStorage), it enables access to specific encrypted content. | The key never leaves the user's device (unless they share it). It is not processed by the server. The server cannot link keys to users. |

**DPO Assessment:** Encryption keys stored in the user's own browser are **not personal data that SGraph processes**. SGraph has no access to these keys and performs no processing on them. The keys exist solely within the user's browser environment, under the user's control.

However, from a transparency and user trust perspective, the keys are **sensitive information that the user should be informed about and have control over**. This is not a GDPR obligation (since SGraph is not the processor of locally-stored keys), but it is a best practice that aligns with our privacy-first positioning.

### 3.2 Disclosure Requirements

Even though locally-stored keys are not personal data processed by SGraph, the following disclosures are recommended:

| Disclosure | Rationale | Where |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| **What is stored** | Transparency -- users should know what data exists in their browser associated with our service | Transparency panel + privacy policy |
| **Why it is stored** | Purpose limitation principle (applied voluntarily) -- explain the convenience benefit | Transparency panel |
| **How to clear it** | User control -- provide a clear, one-click mechanism to delete all locally stored data | Transparency panel |
| **That it is optional** | Consent principle (applied voluntarily) -- key caching must be opt-in | First-time prompt in UI |
| **Risk disclosure** | Honest privacy position -- inform users that locally cached keys could be accessed by other scripts or anyone with device access | Transparency panel info tooltip |
| **That we have no access** | Zero-knowledge reinforcement -- clarify that SGraph cannot see, access, or recover locally stored keys | Privacy policy + transparency panel |

### 3.3 Zero-Storage Mode

Brief #2 proposes a zero-storage mode where nothing is saved locally. From a data protection perspective, this is excellent:

- It provides the maximum-privacy option for users who want it
- It demonstrates data minimisation by design (GDPR Article 25)
- It makes SGraph Send usable in high-security contexts (shared devices, public computers, compliance-sensitive environments)
- It reinforces the zero-knowledge positioning: "Not only can we not see your data, we do not even store anything on your device"

**DPO Recommendation:** Zero-storage mode should be prominently offered, not buried in settings. Consider making it the default for first-time users, with key caching as an opt-in convenience feature for returning users.

### 3.4 Privacy Wording for Local Storage

Draft addition to the privacy policy:

> **Local Browser Storage**
>
> By default, SGraph Send does not store any data in your browser. If you choose to enable key caching (for convenience when accessing previously shared files), the following data may be stored locally in your browser:
>
> - Encryption keys for files you have shared or accessed
> - Your preferred theme and language settings
>
> This data is stored **only on your device**. We have no access to it. We cannot read it, recover it, or transmit it. It is entirely under your control.
>
> You can view exactly what is stored via the transparency panel, delete individual items, or clear all stored data at any time. You can also enable "zero-storage mode" to prevent any local storage entirely.

## 4. Updated Action Items

The v0.2.24 DPO status report identified 6 immediate actions. Brief #2 changes the landscape significantly. Here is the updated status:

### 4.1 Resolved Actions

| # | Previous Action (v0.2.24) | Previous Priority | Resolution |
|---|--------------------------|-------------------|------------|
| 1 | Implement cookie consent (block GA until consent given) | **P0** | **RESOLVED** -- GA being removed. No cookies = no consent required. |
| 3 | Verify GA4 IP anonymisation config | P1 | **RESOLVED** -- GA being removed. No longer relevant. |
| 4 | Review LaunchList DPA terms | P1 | **UNCHANGED** -- still required. LaunchList is still active. |
| 6 | Add data processor register (Google, LaunchList) | P2 | **SIMPLIFIED** -- Google removed from register. Only LaunchList remains as a third-party processor. |

### 4.2 Modified Actions

| # | Previous Action (v0.2.24) | Previous Priority | Updated Action | New Priority |
|---|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| 2 | Draft privacy policy for docs.send.sgraph.ai | **P0** | Draft privacy policy reflecting no-cookie posture, zero-knowledge claims, and server-side analytics only. Policy is now simpler and stronger. | **P1** (de-escalated from P0 because the urgent compliance risk -- PECR violation via GA cookies -- is eliminated by removal) |
| 5 | Document lawful basis for IP hash storage | P1 | Unchanged. IP hashes are still personal data (pseudonymised). Legitimate interest basis must be documented for the ROPA. | P1 |

### 4.3 New Actions from Brief #2

| # | Action | Priority | Owner | Rationale |
|---|--------|----------|-------|-----------|
| N1 | **Confirm GA removal is complete** -- verify `gtag.js` is removed from all pages, GA cookies are no longer set, the GA4 property is deactivated | **P0** | Dev/DPO | Until GA code is physically removed, the PECR violation persists |
| N2 | **Review server-side analytics data map** -- once implemented, confirm that the cache service analytics pipeline does not inadvertently capture personal data beyond hashed IPs | P1 | DPO/Architect | The replacement must not recreate the problem being solved |
| N3 | **Review transparency panel disclosures** -- approve the wording shown to users about what is stored locally | P2 | DPO/Dev | Must be accurate and complete before the feature launches |
| N4 | **Approve privacy policy before publication** -- DPO sign-off on all privacy-related user-facing text is non-negotiable (per ROLE.md) | P1 | DPO/Journalist | Regulatory requirement |
| N5 | **Review CloudFront log data protection** -- when CloudFront access logging is enabled (DevOps Tier 1), confirm IP masking is configured correctly before logs start flowing | P1 | DPO/DevOps | Carried from Brief #1. Hashed IPs in application logs are confirmed adequate. CloudFront native logs need separate review. |
| N6 | **Document lawful basis for server-side analytics** -- legitimate interest for security/abuse prevention. Conduct a Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA) to demonstrate balancing test. | P1 | DPO | Required for ROPA completeness |
| N7 | **Review event data exposure in UI** -- before file event data (views, downloads, timestamps) is shown to users, confirm it does not expose personal data of other users (e.g., download events should not show IP hashes to the file uploader) | P2 | DPO | Carried from Brief #1 (P3, now P2 as implementation approaches) |

### 4.4 Consolidated Action List (Current State)

| # | Action | Priority | Owner | Status |
|---|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Confirm GA removal is complete (code, cookies, property) | **P0** | Dev/DPO | NEW -- blocks compliance resolution |
| 2 | Draft privacy policy (no-cookie, zero-knowledge, server-side only) | P1 | DPO/Journalist | MODIFIED -- simpler scope, de-escalated from P0 |
| 3 | Document lawful basis for IP hash storage (legitimate interest, LIA) | P1 | DPO | CARRIED from v0.2.24 |
| 4 | Review LaunchList DPA terms | P1 | DPO | CARRIED from v0.2.24 |
| 5 | Review server-side analytics data map (post-implementation) | P1 | DPO/Architect | NEW |
| 6 | Review CloudFront log data protection before enabling | P1 | DPO/DevOps | CARRIED from Brief #1 |
| 7 | Document lawful basis for server-side analytics (LIA) | P1 | DPO | NEW |
| 8 | Approve privacy policy before publication | P1 | DPO/Journalist | NEW |
| 9 | Update data processor register (remove Google, retain LaunchList only) | P2 | DPO | SIMPLIFIED from v0.2.24 |
| 10 | Review transparency panel disclosures | P2 | DPO/Dev | NEW |
| 11 | Review event data exposure in UI | P2 | DPO | CARRIED from Brief #1 (escalated from P3) |

---

## 5. Summary of DPO Position

### What changed with Brief #2

Brief #2 fundamentally improves SGraph Send's data protection posture. The single biggest change is the removal of Google Analytics, which:

- **Eliminates the P0 PECR compliance violation** (cookies without consent)
- **Removes the only third-party data processor** that handles user data (Google)
- **Removes international data transfer obligations** for analytics
- **Eliminates the need for cookie consent infrastructure** (saving development effort and reducing attack surface)
- **Enables a uniquely strong privacy claim** -- zero cookies, zero tracking, zero third-party data sharing

### The honest privacy position (updated)

**Before Brief #2:** "We encrypt your files with zero-knowledge, but we also run Google Analytics which sets tracking cookies and sends your behavioural data to Google without your consent."

**After Brief #2:** "We encrypt your files with zero-knowledge. We use no cookies. We have no third-party analytics. We share no data with third parties. Server-side operational logs use hashed IP addresses that cannot be linked back to you. You can verify all of this."

The second statement is the honest privacy position that the DPO can stand behind. Every claim is technically verifiable, legally defensible, and consistent with the product's core value proposition.

### Outstanding risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **LaunchList as data processor** -- still active, DPA not yet reviewed | MEDIUM | Review DPA terms (action #4) |
| **IP hashes are still personal data** -- GDPR Recital 26 | LOW | Document legitimate interest basis (action #3) |
| **CloudFront logs (when enabled) may contain raw IPs** | MEDIUM | DPO review before enabling (action #6) |
| **Privacy policy not yet drafted** | MEDIUM | Draft and publish (action #2) |
| **localStorage key caching introduces new data** | LOW | Opt-in only, transparency panel, zero-storage mode default (Section 3) |

None of these are P0. Removing GA eliminates the only P0 data protection risk. The remaining actions are P1/P2 compliance hygiene that can be addressed systematically.

---

*Next review: after GA removal is confirmed and server-side analytics implementation is available for data protection review. DPO will review the privacy policy draft before publication and the transparency panel wording before the key caching feature launches.*
