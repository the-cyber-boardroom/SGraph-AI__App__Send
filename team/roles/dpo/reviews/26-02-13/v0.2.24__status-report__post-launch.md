# v0.2.24 -- DPO Status Report: Post-Launch Privacy Review

**Version:** v0.2.24
**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Role:** DPO (Data Protection Officer)
**Status:** ACTIVE -- IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

---

## 1. GA4 Deployed Without DPO Review

Google Analytics 4 is now live on `send.sgraph.ai` and `docs.send.sgraph.ai`. This was deployed without a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). This section serves as an initial assessment.

### 1.1 What GA4 Collects

- **Cookies:** `_ga` (2-year expiry, cross-session user ID), `_ga_*` (session-scoped). These are first-party cookies set on the `sgraph.ai` domain.
- **Automatic data:** Page views, session duration, scroll depth, outbound clicks, screen resolution, browser/OS, referrer, language.
- **IP addresses:** GA4 processes the full IP address for geolocation, then truncates it. Google states IP anonymisation is on by default in GA4 for EU properties. Verify this is configured correctly.
- **User ID:** No explicit user ID is set, but the `_ga` cookie creates a persistent pseudonymous identifier.

### 1.2 PECR / GDPR Implications

- **PECR (Cookie Regulations):** GA cookies are not "strictly necessary" for the service. Under UK PECR and EU ePrivacy Directive, consent is required before setting these cookies. **Currently no cookie consent mechanism exists.**
- **GDPR Lawful Basis:** Analytics cookies require consent (not legitimate interest) per CJEU guidance (Planet49, C-673/17). The `_ga` cookie constitutes processing of personal data (pseudonymous identifier).
- **Data Controller/Processor:** SGraph is the data controller. Google is the data processor under the GA4 Data Processing Terms.

### 1.3 Required Actions for GA

| # | Action | Priority | Deadline |
|---|--------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Implement cookie consent banner (load GA only after consent) | **P0** | Before wider launch |
| 2 | Verify GA4 IP anonymisation is active | P1 | This week |
| 3 | Add Google as a data processor in privacy documentation | P1 | This week |
| 4 | Consider GA4 server-side tagging to reduce client-side data exposure | P2 | Phase 2 |

## 2. IP Address Handling

The application hashes IP addresses with SHA-256 using a daily rotating salt before storage.

**Assessment:**
- SHA-256 with salt is a pseudonymisation technique, not anonymisation. The IP space is small (~4 billion IPv4) and rainbow-table attacks are feasible if the salt is compromised.
- Daily salt rotation limits the correlation window to 24 hours, which is good.
- **This is sufficient for the stated purpose** (abuse detection, not user tracking) provided the salt is stored securely and separately from the hashes.
- Under GDPR, hashed IPs are still personal data (recital 26 -- "reasonably likely to be used to identify"). The legal basis should be documented as legitimate interest for security/abuse prevention.

## 3. localStorage Usage

The access token is stored in `localStorage`. Privacy implications:

- `localStorage` persists indefinitely until explicitly cleared.
- No personal data is stored (only the access token, which is a shared secret).
- **No GDPR concern** with the current implementation. The access token is not personal data.

## 4. LaunchList Integration

LaunchList collects name and email address for the waitlist.

**Assessment:**
- LaunchList is a data processor. A Data Processing Agreement (DPA) or equivalent terms must be in place.
- Privacy notice must inform users what data is collected, why, and who processes it.
- Lawful basis: consent (user voluntarily submits their data to join a waitlist).
- Right to erasure: verify LaunchList supports deletion requests.

| # | Action | Priority |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1 | Review LaunchList terms for GDPR-adequate data processing provisions | P1 |
| 2 | Add LaunchList disclosure to privacy wording | P1 |
| 3 | Ensure unsubscribe/deletion mechanism exists | P1 |

---

## 5. Privacy Wording for docs.send.sgraph.ai

The docs site currently has no privacy policy or cookie notice. Required content:

1. **What data is processed:** GA cookies (with consent), IP hashes (legitimate interest), LaunchList submissions (consent).
2. **Who processes it:** SGraph (controller), Google (GA processor), LaunchList (waitlist processor).
3. **Data subject rights:** Access, erasure, portability, objection.
4. **Contact:** Data controller contact details.
5. **Zero-knowledge statement:** Clarify that file contents, file names, and encryption keys are never processed by the server.

## 6. Immediate Actions Summary

| # | Action | Owner | Priority |
|---|--------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Implement cookie consent (block GA until consent given) | Dev/DPO | **P0** |
| 2 | Draft privacy policy for docs.send.sgraph.ai | DPO/Journalist | **P0** |
| 3 | Verify GA4 IP anonymisation config | DevOps/DPO | P1 |
| 4 | Review LaunchList DPA terms | DPO | P1 |
| 5 | Document lawful basis for IP hash storage | DPO | P1 |
| 6 | Add data processor register (Google, LaunchList) | DPO | P2 |

*GA was deployed pragmatically to measure early traction. The privacy debt is manageable but must be addressed before the access token is shared more widely.*
