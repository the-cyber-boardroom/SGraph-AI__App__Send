## 1. Decision 3: LaunchList Script Removal -- DPO Assessment

Decision 3 (v0.2.41 brief) directs removal of the `getlaunchlist.com/js/widget-diy.js` script from the user UI. The form markup remains, posting directly to `https://getlaunchlist.com/s/zSa8gI`.

**DPO position:** This is a positive move. Removing the third-party script eliminates an attack vector (the script could be modified at source to exfiltrate data) and aligns with the zero-third-party-scripts principle established when GA was removed. The form submission to LaunchList via standard HTML POST is lower risk -- it only transmits the data the user explicitly enters (name, email) and only when the user actively submits the form.

**Remaining obligation:** LaunchList remains a data processor. The form collects name and email address with user consent (voluntary submission). My outstanding action (action #4 from v0.2.33) to review LaunchList DPA terms remains open. The script removal does not eliminate this obligation.

## 2. Explorer/Villager Team Split -- Data Protection Implications

The 14 Feb briefs introduce the Wardley Maps-based team split into Explorer and Villager teams with distinct infrastructure.

### 2.1 DPO Placement

The Wardley Maps brief correctly places the DPO as **primarily Villager** -- production systems are where personal data processing actually occurs and where compliance obligations crystallise. The Explorer team consults the DPO as needed.

I agree with this placement. However, I note two important caveats:

1. **Explorer features that will eventually process personal data need DPO consultation before they are handed to the Villager.** If the Explorer builds a feature that involves new personal data processing and the DPO only sees it at Villager stage, the cost of architectural change is much higher. The Explorer should flag features with data protection implications early.

2. **The Villager's production DPO review (listed as P2 in the Villager first brief) should be P1.** No component should deploy to production without documented lawful basis for any personal data processing it performs. This is a legal requirement, not optional hardening.

### 2.2 Separate Infrastructure -- Data Protection Consequences

The Villager brief specifies separate AWS environments. From a data protection perspective:

- **Separate data maps required.** The Explorer and Villager environments process different data. Each needs its own data processing inventory.
- **Production is the DPO's primary concern.** Explorer environments processing test data with no real personal data are low risk. Production environments processing real user data are where all GDPR obligations apply.
- **CloudFront logs in production** will be the first real personal data processing to review at production deployment time. My outstanding action #6 (CloudFront log review) applies specifically to the Villager's production CloudFront configuration.

### 2.3 Separate Repository -- Provenance and Audit

The Villager brief proposes a separate repository. The provenance requirement (tracing every line of Villager code back to Explorer commits) is good practice from both a security and a data protection audit perspective. If we ever need to demonstrate to the ICO how a particular data processing implementation was arrived at, the commit provenance chain provides evidence.

## 3. Unencrypted Mode Proposal -- DPO Assessment

The daily brief proposes an optional unencrypted file transfer mode. This has significant data protection implications.

### 3.1 If Files Are Unencrypted, the Server Sees Plaintext

The entire zero-knowledge architecture depends on client-side encryption. If files are sent unencrypted:

- **The server stores plaintext file contents.** This may include personal data.
- **SGraph becomes a data processor for file contents.** Currently we are not -- we only store ciphertext we cannot read.
- **A data breach involving unencrypted files is fundamentally different.** Exposure of ciphertext is not a breach requiring ICO notification (the data is unintelligible). Exposure of plaintext files containing personal data IS a breach requiring notification.
- **Data subject rights apply to plaintext file contents.** If someone uploads a file containing another person's personal data without encryption, that person has data subject rights (access, erasure, portability) against SGraph as the processor.
- **Retention and deletion obligations change.** For encrypted files, we can retain ciphertext with minimal risk. For unencrypted files, we must have documented retention periods and deletion procedures.

### 3.2 DPO Recommendation

The DPO does not oppose the feature in principle -- the human stakeholder is correct that some use cases do not need encryption. However, if this feature is implemented:

1. **The privacy notice must differentiate.** Users must understand that unencrypted files are stored as plaintext on SGraph infrastructure.
2. **A DPIA is required.** Processing plaintext file contents is a new processing activity that may involve special category data. This requires a formal assessment.
3. **Retention and deletion procedures must be defined** before the feature launches.
4. **The uploader must accept explicit data processing terms** when choosing unencrypted mode -- this is not just a toggle, it changes the legal relationship.
5. **Server-side access controls must be tighter** for unencrypted files -- no one at SGraph should have routine access.

This is not a blocker for research, but the DPO must review and approve before the feature goes live.

## 4. Design Agency Engagement -- Data Protection Considerations

The design agency becomes an external partner with access to project materials.

### 4.1 Data Processing

If the design agency receives any personal data (user feedback, analytics data, screenshots showing real user interactions), they become a data processor. In practice, the brief suggests sharing design artefacts, project context, and brand materials -- none of which should contain personal data. However:

- **Screenshots must be reviewed** before sharing to ensure no personal data is visible (IP hashes, email addresses from LaunchList, user-agent strings that could identify individuals).
- **The proposal to use SGraph Send for file sharing with the agency** is excellent from a data protection perspective -- the agency becomes a real user and the zero-knowledge encryption ensures design files are protected in transit and at rest.

### 4.2 Agent Access for External Partners

The brief proposes external partners talking directly to project-aware Claude bots. If these bots have access to any personal data (analytics, user feedback, IP hashes), the external partner's access to that data must be governed by appropriate agreements. Currently the project data is primarily operational and non-personal, so this is low risk, but it should be monitored as the data corpus grows.

---

## 5. MCP Endpoint -- Data Protection Review

The Explorer brief proposes an MCP endpoint serving role context to external Claude sessions. The DPO concern is minimal because:

- The data served is project documentation (role definitions, task lists, briefs)
- This is not personal data
- No user data flows through this endpoint

**One caveat:** If role context ever includes analytics data, user feedback, or any information derived from personal data processing, the MCP endpoint would need access controls and a lawful basis review. Flag this as a future consideration.

## 8. Summary

The 14 Feb briefs represent a structural maturation of the project. From a data protection perspective:

**Positive developments:**
- GA removal confirmed complete. The P0 PECR violation is resolved.
- LaunchList third-party script removed. Zero third-party scripts now.
- DPO correctly placed as primarily Villager -- production is where compliance matters most.
- Separate infrastructure reduces blast radius for data incidents.

**New concerns:**
- Unencrypted mode would fundamentally change SGraph's data processing role -- requires DPIA.
- Villager production deployment must not proceed without DPO review of data handling (escalated from P2 to P1).
- Design agency engagement needs data hygiene checks on shared materials.

**Open action count:** 14 (7 P1, 5 P2, 2 P3). The critical path remains: privacy policy draft, lawful basis documentation, and CloudFront log review before production.

*Next review: response to 15 Feb briefs. Key focus will be on the AWS observability pipeline and its data protection implications.*
