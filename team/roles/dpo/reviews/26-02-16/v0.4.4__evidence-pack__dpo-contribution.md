## Purpose

This document confirms and expands the 5 known DPO evidence items from the evidence pack brief. For each item, I provide: the exact source, quote verification, impact assessment, and crucially, the counterfactual -- what would have happened without the DPO present.

I also identify additional DPO evidence instances discovered through a search of project documents.

## Known Evidence Items: Confirmed and Expanded

### Evidence Item 1: IP Addresses Not Stored in CloudFront Logs

**Source:** `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/15/v0.3.10__daily-brief__explorer-team-15-feb-2026.md` -- Progress section

**Quote (verified):** "When configuring the AWS logging, the DPO role was keeping an eye on the brief, and the DevOps configuration that went into AWS made sure we don't capture IP addresses or other sensitive data in the logs."

**What happened:** The AWS observability setup (v0.3.6) configured 15 data sources. For CloudFront Real-Time Logs, the configuration explicitly excluded the following fields: `c-ip`, `c-port`, `x-forwarded-for`, `c-ip-version`, and `c-country`. The DPO reviewed the DevOps setup guide (`team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/15/aws-setup/v0.3.6__devops__aws-observability-setup-guide.md`) and confirmed this field selection before it was applied.

**What would have happened without the DPO:**

The default CloudFront log configuration (both Standard Logs and Real-Time Logs with all fields selected) includes `c-ip` (client IP address). Without the DPO's involvement:

1. **The DevOps role would have selected all available log fields** as the default approach for maximum observability. This is standard operational practice -- collect everything, filter later.
2. **IP addresses would have been stored in S3** as part of the raw log files, creating a personal data processing activity with no documented lawful basis.
3. **The SA pipeline would have processed IP addresses** through the LETS transformation, consolidation, and aggregation stages, multiplying the locations where personal data exists.
4. **The project would have been non-compliant with UK GDPR** from the moment CloudFront logs were enabled, without anyone realising it.
5. **Retrofitting IP exclusion** would have required: reconfiguring CloudFront, deleting or re-processing historical logs containing IPs, updating the SA pipeline parsers, and producing a data breach assessment for the period during which IPs were stored without lawful basis.

**Estimated cost of retrofit:** 2-4 engineering sessions to reconfigure and reprocess, plus the compliance risk of having processed personal data without documented lawful basis during the gap period.

**Impacted roles:** DevOps (field selection configuration), Developer (log parser design -- parsers expect no IP fields), Architect (SA pipeline design assumes no PII in the data stream)

**Category:** Privacy by design, GDPR Article 25, data minimisation

**DPO confidence level:** HIGH. This is the strongest, most concrete evidence item. The field-level exclusion is documented in the DevOps setup guide, and the daily brief explicitly credits the DPO's involvement.

### Evidence Item 2: Empirical Verification of IP Address Exclusion

**Source:** `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/16/v0.4.4__briefs__briefing-packs-for-agents.md` -- CloudFront pipeline pack, AppSec/DPO addendum section

**Quote (verified):** "A specific, critical question: are IP addresses actually not being stored in the CloudFront logs? This needs to be confirmed empirically, not assumed."

And: "The DPO requires evidence."

**What happened:** The DPO (together with AppSec) escalated the assurance level from "configuration says no IPs" to "empirical evidence confirms no IPs." The briefing packs brief explicitly includes a DPO addendum in the CloudFront pipeline pack structure, with a specific mandate: examine actual log data, not just configuration settings.

**What would have happened without the DPO:**

1. **The team would have relied on the Firehose configuration as proof.** The field exclusion list would have been the end of the assurance story.
2. **No one would have suggested examining actual log data.** Engineers typically trust their configuration -- "I excluded those fields, therefore they are excluded."
3. **A configuration error or AWS service change** could result in IP addresses appearing in logs without anyone noticing, because no one is checking.
4. **No compliance artefact would exist.** An ICO auditor asking "how do you know IP addresses are not in your logs?" would receive "because we configured it that way," not "because we verified by examining actual log samples and here is the evidence."

**Estimated cost of retrofit:** Minimal engineering cost (examination of log samples is straightforward), but the compliance value of having proactive evidence vs. reactive evidence is significant -- it demonstrates Article 5(2) accountability.

**Impacted roles:** QA (testing approach now includes privacy verification), DevOps (must provide evidence, not just configuration), Architect (SA pipeline design includes a verification step)

**Category:** Compliance evidence, GDPR Article 5(2) accountability, audit trail

**DPO confidence level:** HIGH. The quote is explicit and directly credits the DPO's requirement.

### Evidence Item 3: Privacy Implications of Log Storage and Archival

**Source:** `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/16/v0.4.4__daily-brief__villager-team-16-feb-2026.md` -- SA pipeline section, Step 4 (Archive and Clean)

**Quote context:** The Villager daily brief describes the archive step: "Move the original S3 log files to an archive bucket (cheaper storage class -- S3 Glacier or Infrequent Access)." The DPO's presence ensures retention considerations are part of the design.

**Source 2:** `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/16/v0.4.4__briefs__dpo-appsec-grc-evidence-pack.md` -- DPO Evidence item 3

**Quote (verified):** "The DPO's presence ensures that data retention considerations are built into the archive design -- how long do we keep logs? What's the legal basis for storage? When must they be deleted?"

**What happened:** The log archival pipeline was designed with data retention as a first-class concern. The DPO's role in the team meant that "archive to Glacier" was never just a cost optimisation decision -- it was always also a data governance decision requiring documented retention periods, lawful basis, and deletion triggers.

**What would have happened without the DPO:**

1. **The archive step would have been purely cost-driven.** Move old logs to cheaper storage. No retention period. No deletion schedule. No lawful basis consideration.
2. **Logs would accumulate in Glacier indefinitely.** Without a defined deletion trigger, archived logs would grow unboundedly. This is the default pattern in most engineering teams -- archive everything, delete nothing.
3. **A future data subject access request or ICO inquiry** would reveal that logs were being retained with no documented justification, no retention schedule, and no deletion procedure -- a clear GDPR Article 5(1)(e) violation (storage limitation principle).
4. **Retroactively defining retention** requires examining what has already been stored, classifying it, and determining whether it should have been deleted earlier -- a much harder problem than designing retention from the start.

**Estimated cost of retrofit:** Significant. Retroactive data classification, retention policy drafting, identification and deletion of data that should have been purged, and potentially a DPIA for the processing that occurred without documented lawful basis.

**Impacted roles:** DevOps (archive policy must include retention periods and deletion triggers), Architect (pipeline design includes retention awareness)

**Category:** Data retention, GDPR Article 5(1)(e) storage limitation, data lifecycle management

**DPO confidence level:** MEDIUM-HIGH. The evidence pack brief explicitly cites this. The DPO's influence is real, but the retention periods and deletion triggers have not yet been defined -- they are currently open DPO actions. The influence here is "putting retention on the agenda," which is valuable but not yet a completed outcome.

### Evidence Item 4: Localised Privacy Policies

**Source:** `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/16/v0.4.3__role-definition__translator.md` -- line 250

**Quote (verified):** "DPO produces privacy policies -> Translator produces legally-appropriate localised versions"

**What happened:** When the Translator role was defined, the role definition explicitly included the DPO as a content source whose output requires specialist legal-aware translation. Privacy policies were not treated as generic text to be translated by a general translator -- they were identified as DPO-produced legal documents requiring legally appropriate localisation per market.

**What would have happened without the DPO:**

1. **Privacy policies would have been treated as generic content.** The Translator would receive English text and translate it literally, without awareness of per-market legal requirements.
2. **Legal terms might be translated incorrectly.** Data protection terminology has specific legal meanings in each jurisdiction. "Data controller" has a precise legal definition in UK GDPR, Brazilian LGPD, and Portuguese GDPR implementation -- and the terminology differs. A generic translation could produce legally inaccurate text.
3. **Per-market regulatory differences would be missed.** Brazil's LGPD has different requirements from the UK's UK GDPR. A Brazilian Portuguese privacy policy needs to address LGPD obligations, not just translate UK GDPR language into Portuguese. Without the DPO, this distinction would likely be missed.
4. **The translation pipeline would lack a legal review step.** The DPO provides the content that is legally appropriate for each market; the Translator provides the linguistically appropriate version. Without the DPO in the chain, there is no legal quality gate on translated privacy policies.

**Estimated cost of retrofit:** Legal review of translated privacy policies after the fact, potential need to take down non-compliant translated policies, revision cycle.

**Impacted roles:** Translator (workflow now includes DPO as a content source for legal text), Advocate (user-facing documentation pipeline includes legal quality gate)

**Category:** Regulatory compliance, internationalisation, GDPR Article 12 (transparent communication, clear and plain language)

**DPO confidence level:** MEDIUM. The quote is explicit and verified. The influence is real but at the design/planning stage -- no privacy policies have been translated yet. The value is in structuring the pipeline correctly from the start.

### Evidence Item 5: Zero-Knowledge Architecture as a DPO-Influenced Decision

**Source:** Referenced across multiple briefs. Most explicit: `library/docs/_to_process/01-project-brief.md` (project brief) and the CLAUDE.md rules.

**Quote (from CLAUDE.md):** "Server never sees plaintext -- encryption happens in browser, decryption happens in browser." And: "No file names on server -- original file name never sent to server." And: "No decryption keys on server -- key stays with sender, shared out-of-band." And: "All backend data is non-sensitive/non-confidential -- by design."

**What happened:** The entire SGraph Send architecture is built on a zero-knowledge principle: the server stores only ciphertext it cannot decrypt, never receives file names, never receives encryption keys, and hashes all IP addresses before storage. This is not a feature that was added to an existing architecture -- it is the foundation on which everything else was built.

**What would have happened without the DPO:**

This is the most complex counterfactual because the DPO's presence is so deeply integrated into the foundational architecture that it is difficult to separate. However:

1. **The zero-knowledge design might still have existed** -- it is also driven by the human stakeholder's vision and AppSec's security requirements. The DPO did not "invent" client-side encryption for this project.
2. **What the DPO specifically contributed is the data protection framing.** Without the DPO, the zero-knowledge architecture would be positioned as a security feature. With the DPO, it is positioned as a data protection architecture. The distinction matters because:
   - A security feature can be traded off against usability (e.g., "we could add an unencrypted mode for convenience").
   - A data protection architecture creates legal constraints -- introducing plaintext server-side processing requires a DPIA, documented lawful basis, and updated privacy notices.
3. **The DPO's specific influence on the zero-knowledge architecture** includes:
   - The requirement that file names never be sent to the server (data minimisation beyond what security alone requires)
   - The IP hashing approach (security would suggest not logging IPs; the DPO specifies hashing with daily salt as the specific technique, creating pseudonymised data that cannot be re-identified)
   - The explicit documentation that "all backend data is non-sensitive/non-confidential" -- this is a data protection classification, not a security classification
   - The ongoing resistance to features that would break zero-knowledge (e.g., the unencrypted mode proposal, which the DPO flagged as requiring a DPIA in the 14 Feb brief response)

4. **Without the DPO, the unencrypted mode proposal** (from the 14 Feb daily brief) would likely have been treated as a straightforward feature request. With the DPO present, it was immediately flagged as fundamentally changing SGraph's data processing role, requiring a DPIA, updated privacy notices, explicit user consent, and new retention procedures. This is an active, ongoing example of DPO influence.

**Estimated cost of retrofit:** Not applicable -- this is architectural, not retrofittable. Building a zero-knowledge system from the start is a design choice. Retrofitting zero-knowledge onto a system that handles plaintext would be a complete rewrite.

**Impacted roles:** Architect (entire system design constrained by zero-knowledge principle), Developer (encryption pipeline is mandatory, not optional), DevOps (infrastructure never handles plaintext)

**Category:** Privacy by design, GDPR Article 25 (data protection by design and by default)

**DPO confidence level:** MEDIUM. The zero-knowledge architecture is a team decision, not solely a DPO decision. The DPO's specific contribution is the data protection framing, the data minimisation extensions (no file names, IP hashing), and the ongoing enforcement of zero-knowledge as a non-negotiable constraint. The evidence is real but distributed across many documents rather than concentrated in a single quote.

## Additional DPO Evidence Discovered

Beyond the 5 known items, I identified the following additional instances of DPO influence in project documents.

### Evidence Item A1: Google Analytics Removal -- DPO as a Driver

**Source:** `team/roles/dpo/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.24__status-report__post-launch.md` -- Section 3 (Cookie Audit)

**Source 2:** `team/roles/dpo/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__response-to-daily-brief-2__13-feb.md` -- Section 2 (GA Removal Assessment)

**What happened:** The DPO identified Google Analytics as a PECR violation (third-party cookies without consent) and flagged it as P0 in the v0.2.24 status report. The DPO assessment directly contributed to the decision to remove GA entirely, which was executed in v0.3.0.

**Counterfactual:** Without the DPO, GA would likely have remained in place with a cookie consent banner added. The DPO's assessment elevated the issue from "add consent" to "remove entirely" by framing it as a fundamental contradiction with the zero-knowledge promise. AppSec independently reached the same conclusion (supply chain risk), but the DPO's privacy framing (PECR violation, trust contradiction) was the primary driver for complete removal rather than mitigation.

**Impacted roles:** DevOps (GA removed from infrastructure), Developer (no analytics scripts in UI), Architect (server-side analytics designed as replacement)

**Category:** Privacy compliance, PECR, data minimisation

**DPO confidence level:** HIGH. The DPO reviews are documented, the GA removal is documented, and the brief credits the DPO assessment.

### Evidence Item A2: No File Names on Server -- Data Minimisation Beyond Security

**Source:** `team/roles/dpo/reviews/26-02-15/v0.3.10__response-to-daily-brief__15-feb.md` -- Section 4.1 (Transfer Manifest)

**What happened:** When the file transfer engine brief (v0.3.12) included a transfer manifest example with a `"name": "quarterly-report.pdf"` field, the DPO flagged this as a regression risk. The current architecture deliberately excludes file names from server-side data, and the DPO identified that the new transfer engine must maintain this property.

**Counterfactual:** Without the DPO, the transfer manifest would likely include the original file name as a natural design choice (file names are useful for display, search, and organisation). The DPO's intervention preserves the data minimisation principle: file names can reveal personal data about the sender, recipient, or file subject.

**Impacted roles:** Architect (manifest design constrained to exclude plaintext file names), Developer (client-side code must not send file names)

**Category:** Data minimisation, GDPR Article 5(1)(c)

**DPO confidence level:** HIGH. The DPO review is documented with a specific, actionable requirement.

---

### Evidence Item A3: Unencrypted Mode Flagged as Requiring DPIA

**Source:** `team/roles/dpo/reviews/26-02-14/v0.3.2__response-to-daily-brief__14-feb.md` -- Section 3 (Unencrypted Mode Proposal)

**What happened:** The 14 Feb daily brief proposed an optional unencrypted file transfer mode. The DPO immediately identified this as fundamentally changing SGraph's role from a service that stores opaque ciphertext (no data processing of file contents) to a service that stores plaintext (data processor for file contents). The DPO flagged: DPIA required, privacy notice must differentiate, explicit data processing terms needed, separate retention and deletion procedures, and stricter server-side access controls.

**Counterfactual:** Without the DPO, unencrypted mode would have been treated as a UX feature toggle. The legal implications (SGraph becomes a data processor for file contents, breach notification obligations change, data subject rights apply to stored files) would not have been identified until a data incident or regulatory inquiry occurred.

**Impacted roles:** Architect (feature design must include legal/compliance requirements), Developer (UI must present clear data processing terms for unencrypted mode), AppSec (different threat model for plaintext vs. ciphertext storage)

**Category:** DPIA requirement, GDPR Article 35, data processing role assessment

**DPO confidence level:** HIGH. The DPO review is documented with specific requirements.

---

### Evidence Item A4: LaunchList DPA Requirement Identified

**Source:** `team/roles/dpo/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.24__status-report__post-launch.md`

**What happened:** The DPO identified that the LaunchList signup form (collecting name and email) makes LaunchList a data processor, requiring a Data Processing Agreement. This was logged as an open action item.

**Counterfactual:** Without the DPO, the LaunchList integration would have been treated as a simple form submission. The DPA obligation would not have been identified, leaving the project without a documented data processing relationship for the only third-party service handling personal data.

**Impacted roles:** Project lead (must execute the DPA review)

**Category:** GDPR Article 28 (processor relationships)

**DPO confidence level:** MEDIUM. The requirement is documented but not yet actioned.

---

### Evidence Item A5: CloudFront Referrer-Policy for Privacy (Not Just Security)

**Source:** `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/15/aws-setup/v0.3.6__devops__aws-observability-setup-guide.md` -- Step 3 (CloudFront Response Headers)

**What happened:** The CloudFront configuration includes `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` as a response header. While AppSec originally flagged this as a security measure (preventing hash-fragment key leakage), the DPO's framing broadened the rationale: this also prevents any URL-based personal data from leaking to third parties via the Referrer header.

**Counterfactual:** AppSec would have requested this header regardless (it closes threat T8). The DPO's contribution is the dual justification: it is both a security control AND a data protection control. This means even if the security justification were removed (e.g., keys moved out of URL fragments), the data protection justification would keep the header in place.

**Impacted roles:** DevOps (header configuration)

**Category:** Privacy by design, data protection overlay on security controls

**DPO confidence level:** MEDIUM. The header was driven by AppSec; the DPO's contribution is the additional data protection justification.

## DPO Self-Interview Responses

Per the evidence pack brief, the DPO should answer four questions.

### 1. What is your most impactful intervention so far?

**Evidence Item 1: IP addresses excluded from CloudFront logs.** This is the clearest example of DPO influence changing an outcome that would have been different without the role present. The default configuration includes IPs. The DPO's presence changed the default. Every other evidence item is important, but this one has the most direct, verifiable, concrete impact on data protection.

### 2. What is the biggest risk you have prevented or reduced?

**Undetected personal data processing in the log pipeline.** If CloudFront logs included IP addresses and no one noticed (because no one was looking from a data protection perspective), the project would have been processing personal data without documented lawful basis, without a retention policy, and without data subject rights procedures. This is the kind of quiet non-compliance that only surfaces during a breach or regulatory inquiry -- at which point the remediation cost is orders of magnitude higher.

### 3. What is different about being embedded from the start vs. reviewing at the end?

**Architecture vs. audit.** When the DPO reviews at the end, the output is a list of problems to fix. When the DPO is embedded from the start, the output is an architecture that does not have those problems. The CloudFront log configuration is the perfect example: at the end, the DPO would say "you need to stop capturing IPs and delete the ones you already have." From the start, the DPO says "do not capture IPs" and the problem never exists.

The cost difference is not just engineering effort. Retrofitting privacy means admitting the system was non-compliant for a period. Designing privacy in means the system was never non-compliant. The second is not just cheaper -- it is legally different.

### 4. What concerns do you still have that have not been addressed?

In priority order:

1. **No privacy policy exists.** The project is live, users are accessing it, and there is no published privacy notice. This is a UK GDPR Article 13 requirement. It has been an open P1 action since 13 Feb and remains unaddressed.
2. **No documented lawful basis for IP hash storage.** The application hashes IP addresses with a daily salt. This is pseudonymisation, not anonymisation -- the hashed IPs are still personal data under GDPR. The lawful basis (likely legitimate interests) has not been documented via a Legitimate Interests Assessment.
3. **No LaunchList DPA.** LaunchList processes name and email addresses on our behalf. A Data Processing Agreement is required under Article 28.
4. **The SA pipeline is growing faster than the data map.** New data flows are being added (CloudFront logs, CloudWatch logs, CloudTrail, S3 access logs, temporal aggregations, Glacier archives) without a comprehensive data map that tracks what personal data (even pseudonymised) flows through each stage.
