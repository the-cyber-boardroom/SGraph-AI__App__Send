## Executive Summary

The v0.3.2 briefs mark the most significant structural change since the project's inception: the single team splits into Explorer and Villager based on Wardley Maps methodology. The Cartographer is explicitly identified as "central to this entire structure" -- the role that makes the framework operational rather than theoretical.

This action plan delivers:
1. Updated Wardley Evolution Map (v0.3.2) with all components, including 5 new ones from the daily brief
2. The Explorer/Villager Handover Pipeline -- a visual showing transition states
3. Maturity assessment for all Custom-Built components
4. System topology updates for the two-team infrastructure
5. Carries Forward from the v0.3.0 review

### 1.3 Movement Since v0.3.0

Three components have moved rightward on the evolution axis:

```
                  GENESIS            CUSTOM-BUILT           PRODUCT
                     |                    |                     |
  Admin interface    |=====[moved]=======>|                     |
                     |                    |                     |
  Cache integration  |=====[moved]=======>|                     |
                     |                    |                     |
  Inter-Lambda comms |    [new at]========|                     |
                     |                    |                     |
  Analytics midware  |    [new at]========|                     |
                     |                    |                     |
```

And five new components have appeared at Genesis (C17-C21), identified from user feedback and the design agency engagement.

### 2.2 Handover Readiness Assessment

| Component | Handover Ready? | Blocker(s) | Est. Sessions to Ready |
|-----------|----------------|------------|----------------------|
| Browser encryption | YES | None -- works end-to-end | 0 (write brief) |
| File upload/download | YES | None -- works end-to-end | 0 (write brief) |
| S3 storage backend | YES | None -- Memory-FS abstraction works | 0 (write brief) |
| Token system | YES | None -- CRUD + usage tracking works | 0 (write brief) |
| Link sharing | YES | None -- full flow tested | 0 (write brief) |
| Admin interface | NO | v0.1.0 is placeholder only | 2-3 sessions |
| Cache integration | PARTIAL | Works but coupled to admin only | 1 session |
| Inter-Lambda comms | PARTIAL | Works but untested at production scale | 1 session (perf test) |
| Analytics middleware | PARTIAL | Works but no retention/aggregation strategy | 1-2 sessions |

### 2.3 First Handover Package (Recommended)

The five "YES" components should be handed over as a single package. They form a coherent unit -- the core file transfer flow:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  HANDOVER PACKAGE #1: "Core Transfer Flow"                             |
|  Status: READY FOR HANDOVER                                            |
|                                                                        |
|  Components:                                                           |
|  1. Browser-side encryption (AES-256-GCM, Web Crypto API)             |
|  2. File upload flow (create -> upload -> complete)                    |
|  3. File download flow (info -> download -> decrypt)                   |
|  4. S3 storage backend (via Memory-FS abstraction)                     |
|  5. Token/invitation system (create, lookup, use, revoke)              |
|  6. Link sharing (token-scoped URLs with #fragment key)                |
|                                                                        |
|  Dependencies included:                                                |
|  - Transfer__Service, Storage_FS, Admin__Service__Client               |
|  - Service__Tokens, Send__Cache__Client                                |
|  - Fast_API__Service__Registry (IN_MEMORY/REMOTE modes)                |
|                                                                        |
|  Test coverage: 111+ tests, all passing, in-memory stack               |
|  Known limitations:                                                    |
|  - 20MB Lambda payload limit (proxy mode)                              |
|  - No chunked upload (single payload)                                  |
|  - No retry on upload failure                                          |
|  - No checksum verification                                            |
|  - Cold start latency (1-3s first request)                             |
|                                                                        |
|  NEXT STEP: Explorer writes handover brief per AD-2 format             |
|  (see Architect review: ../architect/reviews/26-02-14/                 |
|   v0.3.0__review__next-steps-from-wardley-briefs.md)                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## 3. New Components to Map

The v0.3.2 daily brief introduces five new components. Here is where each sits on the evolution axis and why.

### 3.1 External Partner Claude Bot (C17)

```
Stage:    Genesis (early)
Reason:   Pure research -- no implementation exists. The concept is defined
          (project-aware Claude session for external partners) but the
          mechanism is unknown. No standard tooling exists for this pattern.
Team:     Explorer (Architect research task, P2)
Movement: Genesis --> Genesis (research phase, no rightward movement expected
          until the design agency engagement validates the approach)
```

**Dependencies:** Design agency engagement (validates need), Claude API/SDK capabilities, access scoping mechanism.

**Map position:** Low visibility (internal collaboration tool), far left on evolution axis.

### 3.2 Slack/WhatsApp Integration (C18)

```
Stage:    Genesis (early)
Reason:   Research task. External integrations (Slack bots, WhatsApp Business
          API) are well-understood in the industry (Product/Commodity stage
          externally), but our specific integration is unexplored. The gap
          is between mature external APIs and our unbuilt connector.
Team:     Explorer (Architect research task, P2)
Movement: Genesis --> Genesis (research only, no build expected this cycle)
```

**Dependencies:** External Claude bot (C17) findings inform this, Slack API maturity, WhatsApp Business API access.

**Map position:** Low visibility (internal tool), far left. Note: the external APIs themselves are Commodity, but our use of them is Genesis.

### 3.3 Unencrypted File Mode (C19)

```
Stage:    Genesis (evaluation)
Reason:   The concept exists but has not been evaluated. The daily brief
          explicitly frames this as a question ("should we?"), not a
          decision. Requires Advocate, AppSec, and Architect input before
          it can move.
Team:     Explorer (evaluation task, P3)
Movement: Genesis --> Genesis (may not move at all if evaluation says "no")
```

**Dependencies:** User research (Advocate), security review (AppSec), architecture assessment (Architect). This component is unique in that it might be deliberately killed -- the evaluation may conclude it dilutes the security positioning.

**Map position:** High visibility (user-facing if built), far left. Potential dead end.

### 3.4 Read Receipts (C20)

```
Stage:    Genesis (captured for roadmap)
Reason:   The underlying data exists -- analytics events already record
          downloads. But the user-facing feature (sender sees when
          recipient downloaded) has no implementation, no UI, no design.
          The data foundation accelerates this, but the feature itself
          is unexplored.
Team:     Explorer (roadmap, P3)
Movement: Genesis --> Genesis (not active work this cycle)
```

**Dependencies:** Analytics middleware (C7), event data model, sender-facing UI component.

**Map position:** High visibility (user-facing), far left. Accelerated by existing event data.

### 3.5 Multi-File Upload / Folder Management (C21)

```
Stage:    Genesis (captured for roadmap)
Reason:   No implementation exists. The current flow is single-file only.
          Multi-file introduces new UX patterns (collection management,
          progress tracking for multiple items), new backend patterns
          (grouping transfers, folder metadata), and new considerations
          (total size limits, partial completion).
Team:     Explorer (roadmap, P3)
Movement: Genesis --> Genesis (not active work this cycle)
```

**Dependencies:** Large file transfer architecture (C13), UI redesign, Transfer__Service extension.

**Map position:** High visibility (user-facing), far left.

### 3.6 New Components on the Map

```
GENESIS (all new components start here)
|
|  [External Claude Bot] .... (C17, P2 research)
|  [Slack/WhatsApp Bot] ..... (C18, P2 research)
|  [Unencrypted Mode] ....... (C19, P3 evaluate -- may be killed)
|  [Read Receipts] .......... (C20, P3 roadmap -- data exists)
|  [Multi-File Upload] ...... (C21, P3 roadmap)
|
|  Arrows show no rightward movement this cycle.
|  All five are in discovery/evaluation phase.
```

## 4. System Topology Update

### 4.1 Two-Team Infrastructure Model

The Wardley Maps brief requires "distinct environments." The Architect recommends Option B (same AWS account, separate resources with naming conventions). Here is the updated topology reflecting two teams.

```
+=========================================================================+
|                         AWS ACCOUNT                                      |

  no API keys, no CloudWatch log groups)
- Explorer deployments CANNOT affect Villager/production
- Villager takes code snapshots from Explorer, not live connections

### 4.3 Changes from v0.1.2 System Landscape Map

| Area | v0.1.2 State | v0.3.2 State |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Environment model | 4 tiers (local, dev, qa, prod) | 2 teams (Explorer=dev, Villager=prod) + local/test |
| QA environment | Separate tier | Absorbed into Villager pipeline (pre-prod stage) |
| Deployment trigger | Auto on push to dev | Explorer: auto on dev. Villager: manual promotion from release branch |
| Branching | All on `dev` | Explorer on `dev`, Villager on `release/*` (Architect AD-3 Option A) |
| Lambda count (total) | 6 (2 per env x 3 envs) | 4 (2 Explorer dev + 2 Villager prod) + 2 local = 4 deployed |
| S3 buckets (total) | 3 (1 per env) | 2 (1 Explorer + 1 Villager) |
| CloudFront | Deferred (all tiers) | Villager/prod only |
| Monitoring | Planned | Villager responsibility (new) |
| Inter-Lambda comms | Planned | Implemented (Service Registry, both envs) |
| CI/CD pipelines | 1 shared | 2 separate (Explorer + Villager) |

## 5. Maturity Assessment: Custom-Built Components

For each component currently at Custom-Built stage, how close is it to Product, and what would push it there?

### 5.1 Browser-Side Encryption (C1)

```
Current:  Custom-Built (solid)
To Product: ~70% there
Gap:
  - No large file support (chunked encryption)
  - No fallback for older browsers (WebCrypto detection)
  - No performance profiling at scale (how fast for 1GB? 5GB?)
  - No user-facing error recovery (if encryption fails mid-way)
What pushes it to Product:
  - Villager performance tests at realistic file sizes
  - Error handling hardening
  - Browser compatibility matrix verification
  - Documented operational characteristics (speed, memory usage, limits)
```

### 5.2 File Upload/Download Flow (C2)

```
Current:  Custom-Built (solid)
To Product: ~65% there
Gap:
  - 20MB Lambda payload limit (proxy mode) -- hard ceiling
  - No retry on failure
  - No progress indication
  - No checksum/integrity verification
  - Single-file only (no batch)
What pushes it to Product:
  - Villager addresses the 20MB limit (pre-signed URLs or chunked)
  - Production-grade error handling
  - Upload/download monitoring and metrics
  - Documented size limits and performance characteristics
```

### 5.3 S3 Storage Backend (C3)

```
Current:  Custom-Built (solid)
To Product: ~75% there
Gap:
  - No lifecycle policies (files persist indefinitely)
  - No storage cost monitoring
  - No cross-region replication (single-region)
  - No backup/disaster recovery strategy
What pushes it to Product:
  - Villager configures lifecycle policies (auto-expiry)
  - Cost monitoring and alerting
  - Documented storage architecture and limits
  - Production S3 bucket hardening (versioning, encryption-at-rest)
```

### 5.4 Token/Invitation System (C4)

```
Current:  Custom-Built (solid)
To Product: ~70% there
Gap:
  - No token expiry by time (only by usage count)
  - No rate limiting on token validation
  - No audit log export capability
  - No bulk token management
What pushes it to Product:
  - Villager adds rate limiting (production security)
  - Time-based expiry (Villager can add without feature change --
    it's a configuration, not a behaviour change)
  - Production-grade token storage durability
  - Documented token lifecycle and operational procedures
```

### 5.5 Link Sharing (C5)

```
Current:  Custom-Built (solid)
To Product: ~60% there
Gap:
  - No custom domain support (links use Lambda URL)
  - No link preview / social media metadata
  - No short URLs (current URLs are long)
  - No link expiry independent of token expiry
What pushes it to Product:
  - Villager sets up CloudFront with custom domain (send.sgraph.ai)
  - Clean, short, branded URLs
  - Social media preview tags (og:title, og:description)
  - Documented URL format and structure
```

### 5.6 Maturity Summary

```
                        0%        25%        50%        75%        100%
                        |          |          |          |          |
  S3 Storage Backend    |==========|==========|==========|===       | 75%

  Link Sharing          |==========|==========|====      |          | 60%
                        |          |          |          |          |
                        CUSTOM-BUILT                     PRODUCT
                        (Explorer delivered)              (Villager target)

  Average maturity: 68% of the way from Custom-Built to Product
  Estimated Villager sessions to first production release: 3-5
```

## 6. Carries Forward from v0.3.0

The v0.3.0 Cartographer review documented 8 changes from the v0.2.24 state. Here is the status of each, with updates for v0.3.2.

### 6.1 Status of v0.3.0 Changes

| # | v0.3.0 Change | v0.3.2 Status | Notes |
|---|--------------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | Inter-Lambda communication implemented | STABLE | Service Registry works in both IN_MEMORY and REMOTE modes. No changes needed. Carries to Villager as-is. |
| 2 | Token validation wired in user Lambda | STABLE | Routes__Transfers.check_access_token() calls admin. Carries to Villager as-is. |
| 3 | Admin Lambda endpoints (5 token + 1 pulse) | STABLE | No new endpoints added. Carries to Villager as-is. |
| 4 | Admin UI v0.1.0 (placeholder) | UPDATED | Still a placeholder but now identified as an Explorer-only component (not in Handover Package #1). Admin interface moved to Custom-Built (early) on evolution map. |
| 5 | Analytics middleware implemented | STABLE | Middleware__Analytics on admin Lambda recording all requests. Needs retention strategy before it can move to Product. |
| 6 | Cache namespaces (4 defined, 2 active) | STABLE | analytics and tokens active. transfers and costs remain future. No changes. |
| 7 | Schemas (6 Type_Safe) | STABLE | All using domain-specific primitives. No new schemas added. |
| 8 | Storage namespace map documented | STABLE | Full path structure from v0.3.0 review still accurate. |

### 6.2 New Changes in v0.3.2 (for future tracking)

| # | v0.3.2 Change | Status | Notes |
|---|--------------|--------|-------|
| 9 | Explorer/Villager team split introduced | STRUCTURAL | Entire system now has two deployment tracks |
| 10 | 5 new components identified (C17-C21) | MAPPED | All at Genesis, all Explorer territory |
| 11 | Admin interface moved Genesis -> Custom-Built | EVOLUTION | Placeholder shipped, Web Component architecture proposed |
| 12 | Cache integration moved Genesis -> Custom-Built | EVOLUTION | Send__Cache__Client operational |
| 13 | Two-pipeline deployment model | PLANNED | Explorer auto-deploy, Villager manual promotion |
| 14 | Handover Package #1 identified | READY | 5 components ready for handover brief |
| 15 | QA environment absorbed into Villager pipeline | TOPOLOGY | Simplifies from 4 tiers to 2 teams + local |
| 16 | Branching strategy proposed | PENDING DECISION | AD-3 from Architect: Explorer on `dev`, Villager on `release/*` |

## 7. Cartographer Action Items

### 7.1 Immediate (This Session / Next Session)

| # | Action | Priority | Dependencies |
|---|--------|----------|-------------|
| A1 | Publish this evolution map to all roles -- Explorer and Villager need the shared picture | P1 | None (this document) |
| A2 | Support Explorer in writing Handover Package #1 brief by providing the component inventory and maturity data from Section 5 | P1 | Explorer meta-role starts handover process |
| A3 | Create `.issues` file for Cartographer workstream tracking | P1 | Issues FS adoption directive |
| A4 | Update system landscape map (v0.3.2) to reflect two-team topology | P1 | AD-1 and AD-3 decisions from Architect/Dinis |

### 7.2 Ongoing (Each Session)

| # | Action | Trigger |
|---|--------|---------|
| A5 | Track component movement on evolution axis | Any component changes stage |
| A6 | Update handover pipeline visual | Any component enters/exits handover zone |
| A7 | Assess new components from briefs | Each new daily brief |
| A8 | Provide maturity data to Explorer/Villager | On request or at handover points |

### 7.3 Medium Term

| # | Action | Priority | Dependencies |
|---|--------|----------|-------------|
| A9 | Create a living Wardley Map document (separate from reviews) that is the canonical evolution map, updated incrementally | P2 | Librarian indexes it |
| A10 | Map the design agency external dependency -- new type of component (external service provider, not internal component) | P2 | Design agency engagement starts |
| A11 | Research Town Planners trigger criteria -- when should we introduce the third team? What signals indicate a component is ready for commoditisation? | P3 | Multiple components reach Product stage |

## 8. Key Observations for the Conductor

1. **The handover is the bottleneck.** Five components are ready. The Villager team cannot start until the Explorer writes the handover brief. This is the critical path item (also identified by the Architect).

2. **The five new components are all Genesis and all Explorer.** None of them affect the Villager's immediate work. The Explorer can continue discovering while the Villager productises.

3. **The Admin interface is NOT in Handover Package #1.** It's at early Custom-Built stage (placeholder only). The Villager's first release will need a minimal admin interface, but this should be scoped separately.

4. **The 20MB Lambda payload limit is the biggest technical risk for production.** The Villager will hit this immediately with real users. Pre-signed URL mode or chunked upload needs to be on the critical path, even though the Explorer hasn't built it yet. This may require a second handover package once the Explorer solves it.

5. **Two CI/CD pipelines need to be built.** The current single pipeline on `dev` becomes the Explorer pipeline. The Villager pipeline doesn't exist yet. DevOps is a P1 Villager dependency.

*This action plan reflects the system state as of v0.3.2. All component assessments are based on implemented, tested code (from v0.3.0 codebase) plus the structural changes introduced by the v0.3.2 briefs. The Wardley Evolution Map will be updated as components move along the axis.*
