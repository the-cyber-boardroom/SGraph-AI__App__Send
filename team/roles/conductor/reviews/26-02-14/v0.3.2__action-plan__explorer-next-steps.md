## Context: What Changed Between v0.3.0 and v0.3.2

The v0.3.0 sprint plan was laser-focused: **ship the admin UI**. That shipped. Gate G8 cleared. The v0.3.2 brief changes the landscape fundamentally:

1. **The MVP is proven end-to-end.** Real users completed the full flow. This triggers the Explorer/Villager split.
2. **User feedback arrived.** Two actionable signals: "why not WeTransfer?" (positioning gap) and large files (the sweet spot).
3. **An external partner is incoming.** A design agency needs a brief, a presentation, and a collaboration workflow.
4. **Issues FS must be adopted now.** The new flat-file format removes the complexity barrier. Start tracking with `.issues` files immediately.
5. **The Conductor is now an Explorer-team Conductor.** The Villager team has its own coordination. This plan covers Explorer territory only.

**Standing directive changes:** From "ship the admin UI, limit planning overhead" to **"push the frontier, capture everything, prepare handovers for what's mature."**

---

## 1. Sprint Plan: Explorer Track

### Priority Tiers

```
P1 — Do Now (next 1-2 sessions)
  [1]  Issues FS Adoption — create .issues files for all active workstreams
  [2]  Design Agency Brief — logo, brand identity, website mockups, design system
  [3]  Design Agency Kickoff Presentation — visual walkthrough for external partner
  [4]  Explorer Handover Brief — document MVP components ready for Villager

P2 — Do Next (next 2-4 sessions)
  [5]  Large File Transfer Architecture — chunked upload, retry, checksum design
  [6]  Landing Page — address "why not WeTransfer?" in the first 10 seconds
  [7]  External Partner Claude Bot Research — project-aware Q&A for design agency
  [8]  Slack/WhatsApp Bot Integration Research — communication channel options

P3 — Roadmap Capture (design and document, build later)
  [9]  Unencrypted File Transfer Mode Evaluation
  [10] Read Receipts — surface download/open events to sender
  [11] Multi-File Upload / Folder Management
```

### Sequencing Rationale

**Issues FS comes first** because it is the tracking mechanism for everything else. Without it, the other workstreams have no task tracking. This is a 1-2 hour bootstrapping task, not a multi-day project.

**Design agency brief is time-sensitive** because an external partner is waiting. This workstream has a real-world deadline that is not under our control.

**Explorer handover brief** is critical path for the Villager team. Until the Explorer produces handover documentation for the five mature components (encryption, upload/download, S3, tokens, link sharing), the Villager team cannot start productisation. This is the Explorer team's obligation to the Villager team.

**Large file transfer** is P2 not P1 because the brief says "architecture should support it from the start" but "doesn't need to be built today." Design the approach now, build later.

---

## 2. Issues FS Adoption Plan

### The Problem

The existing `.issues/` directory uses a nested JSON format (issue.json files inside deeply nested `issues/Project-1/issues/Phase-1/issues/Feature-N/issues/Task-N/` folders). This is the old format. The v0.3.2 brief says adoption was low because "the previous format was too complex for agents to maintain easily."

The new format is simple flat files: text files where each line is an issue (`Task-1 | status | description`).

### The Plan

**Step 1: Create workstream `.issues` files** (Conductor, immediate)

Create flat-file `.issues` files for each active Explorer workstream. These go in the `.issues/` directory alongside the existing structure (do not delete the old structure -- it may still be used by Issues FS tooling).

| File | Workstream | Owner |
|------|-----------|-------|
| `.issues/explorer-design-agency.issues` | Design agency brief + presentation | Designer, Architect |
| `.issues/explorer-landing-page.issues` | Landing page + positioning | Designer, Journalist, Advocate |
| `.issues/explorer-large-file.issues` | Large file transfer architecture | Architect |
| `.issues/explorer-bot-research.issues` | External partner bot + Slack/WhatsApp | Architect |
| `.issues/explorer-handover.issues` | Handover briefs for Villager | Explorer meta-role, Architect |
| `.issues/explorer-issues-fs.issues` | Issues FS adoption itself | Conductor |

**Step 2: Populate initial tasks** (Conductor, immediate)

Each file gets seeded with the known tasks from the v0.3.2 brief. Roles update their `.issues` file when they start and finish work.

**Step 3: Role adoption** (All roles, ongoing)

Every role, when starting work on an Explorer workstream, checks the relevant `.issues` file and updates it. When finishing work, mark the task done. This is not optional -- it is how we track what is happening.

### Format Convention

```
# {workstream-name}
# Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
# Owner: {primary-role}

Task-1 | pending   | Description of what needs to happen
Task-2 | active    | Description of what is in progress
Task-3 | done      | Description of what was completed
```

Status values: `pending`, `active`, `done`, `blocked`, `deferred`.

## 3. Role Assignments

### Wave 1: Foundation (Parallel -- Start Immediately)

| Role | Task | Deliverable | Time |
|------|------|-------------|------|
| **Conductor** | Issues FS bootstrapping | 6 `.issues` files, seeded with tasks from this plan | 1 hour |
| **Architect** | Large file transfer design (E5) | Architecture brief: chunked uploads, retry, checksum, Memory-FS compatibility | 2-3 hours |
| **Architect** | Support Designer on design agency brief (E1) | Technical context section: how the system works, constraints, API shape | 1 hour |

### Wave 2: Design Agency (Sequential -- After Wave 1 Architect delivers technical context)

| Role | Task | Deliverable | Time |
|------|------|-------------|------|
| **Designer** | Design agency brief (E1) | Comprehensive brief covering brand, logo, identity, website mockups, multi-theme/accessibility, design system requirements | 3-4 hours |
| **Designer** | Design agency kickoff presentation (E2) | Visual presentation for external partner kickoff | 2-3 hours |
| **Advocate** | User persona section for design brief | Persona descriptions, user needs, "why not WeTransfer?" insight | 1 hour |
| **Ambassador** | Market positioning section for design brief | Competitive landscape, differentiator, positioning statement | 1 hour |

### Wave 3: Handover + Research (Parallel with Wave 2)

| Role | Task | Deliverable | Time |
|------|------|-------------|------|
| **Architect** | Explorer handover brief for encryption (V1 prerequisite) | Handover document at `team/roles/explorer/handovers/` | 2 hours |
| **Architect** | Explorer handover brief for upload/download + S3 + tokens (V1 prerequisite) | Handover document(s) at `team/roles/explorer/handovers/` | 3 hours |
| **Architect** | External partner Claude bot research (E6) | Research brief: options, scoping, context loading, access control | 2 hours |
| **Architect** | Slack/WhatsApp bot integration research (E7) | Research brief: maturity assessment, integration options, effort estimate | 2 hours |

### Wave 4: Landing Page + Positioning (After Wave 2 delivers design brief)

| Role | Task | Deliverable | Time |
|------|------|-------------|------|
| **Designer** | Landing page wireframes addressing WeTransfer comparison | Wireframes / mockups showing differentiation in first 10 seconds | 2-3 hours |
| **Journalist** | Landing page copy | Headlines, body copy, value proposition text, i18n-ready strings | 2 hours |
| **Advocate** | Landing page review from user perspective | Feedback document: does the page answer "why should I use this?" | 1 hour |
| **Ambassador** | Landing page review from positioning perspective | Feedback document: is the competitive differentiation clear? | 1 hour |

### Wave 5: Record + Catalogue (After each wave delivers)

| Role | Task | Deliverable | Time |
|------|------|-------------|------|
| **Librarian** | Catalogue all Explorer outputs | Updated master index | 30 min per wave |
| **Historian** | Record Explorer/Villager split as structural milestone | Decision record and narrative update | 1 hour |
| **Cartographer** | Update Wardley Map with current evolution positions | Updated evolution map reflecting handover readiness | 1 hour |

### Roles NOT Activated in Explorer Track

| Role | Why Not |
|------|---------|
| **DevOps** | Primarily Villager. Explorer has no deployment tasks. |
| **QA** | Primarily Villager for this cycle. Explorer QA comes when new features are testable. |
| **GRC** | Production compliance -- Villager territory. |
| **DPO** | Data protection review of production -- Villager territory. |
| **CISO** | Consulted only if AppSec flags something during Explorer work. |

---

## 4. Design Agency Brief Coordination

### Who Does What

| Contributor | Section | Deadline |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Architect** | Technical context: how SGraph Send works, system architecture, constraints, IFD methodology, Web Components approach | Wave 1 (first) |
| **Advocate** | User personas: who uses the product, what their pain points are, the WeTransfer comparison, the large-file sweet spot | Wave 2 (parallel with Designer) |
| **Ambassador** | Market positioning: competitive landscape, differentiator, "zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing" as positioning | Wave 2 (parallel with Designer) |
| **Designer** | Assembly: takes all inputs, produces the final brief and the kickoff presentation | Wave 2 (after Architect input, parallel with Advocate/Ambassador) |

### Brief Contents (per v0.3.2 daily brief)

1. **Context and explanation** -- what SGraph Send is, project structure, agentic team, current state, known UX problems
2. **Design requirements** -- logo (full colour, B&W, high contrast, visually-impaired, multi-size), brand identity (colours, typography, visual language), website mockups (first impression, upload/encrypt, download/decrypt, admin, trust communication)
3. **Multi-theme and accessibility constraints** -- multiple colour themes, accessibility themes, multiple languages, content decoupled from design
4. **Design system requirement** -- not a single design, a system that works across all variants
5. **Logistics** -- file sharing via SGraph Send (dogfooding), deliverable formats, review process, timeline

### Presentation

A kickoff deck for someone outside the project. Visual, clear, structured. The Designer owns this, with input from Advocate (personas) and Ambassador (positioning).

### Timeline

- **Session 1:** Architect delivers technical context. Conductor delivers Issues FS files.
- **Session 2:** Designer assembles brief with Advocate and Ambassador inputs.
- **Session 3:** Designer produces kickoff presentation. Brief reviewed.
- **Target:** Brief ready for design agency within 2-3 Explorer sessions.

### Issue Tracking

All design agency tasks tracked in `.issues/explorer-design-agency.issues`.

## 5. Parallel Workstreams

The following workstreams can run simultaneously because they have no dependencies on each other:

```
STREAM A: Design Agency Brief (Designer, Architect, Advocate, Ambassador)
    |
    | No dependency on:
    v
STREAM B: Explorer Handover Briefs (Architect, Explorer meta-role)
    |
    | No dependency on:
    v
STREAM C: Research -- Bot + Slack/WhatsApp (Architect)
    |
    | No dependency on:
    v
STREAM D: Landing Page Positioning (Designer, Journalist, Advocate, Ambassador)
```

**Constraint:** The Architect is involved in Streams A, B, and C. This is a bottleneck. Sequencing for the Architect:

1. **First:** Technical context for design agency brief (Stream A input) -- 1 hour
2. **Then:** Large file transfer architecture design (P2, feeds into Stream B context) -- 2-3 hours
3. **Then:** Handover briefs (Stream B) -- 3-5 hours total across components
4. **Then:** Bot research (Stream C) -- 2-4 hours total

The Architect's work on Stream A unblocks the Designer. The Architect can then work on Streams B and C while the Designer works on the brief and presentation.

**Stream D (Landing Page)** should start after Stream A because the design agency brief will clarify the brand direction. Landing page work without brand direction risks rework.

---

## 6. Handover Readiness Assessment

Based on the Architect's evolution map, five components are in the "handover zone" (Custom-Built, ready to move to Product):

| Component | Readiness | What's Needed Before Handover |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| **Browser-side encryption** | HIGH | Handover brief documenting Web Crypto API usage, AES-256-GCM parameters, key derivation, known limitations. No functionality gaps. |
| **File upload/download flow** | HIGH | Handover brief documenting the pre-signed URL flow, transfer lifecycle, event recording. Note: large file support NOT included -- that stays with Explorer. |
| **S3 storage backend** | HIGH | Handover brief documenting Memory-FS abstraction, S3 backend configuration, prefix isolation. Already well-tested. |
| **Token/invitation system** | HIGH | Handover brief documenting token CRUD, usage tracking, validation middleware. Admin UI documents the API contract. |
| **Link sharing** | MEDIUM-HIGH | Handover brief documenting hash-fragment URLs, share flow, key separation. The "key never leaves sender" model needs clear documentation for Villager team. |

### Components NOT Ready for Handover (Stay with Explorer)

| Component | Stage | Why Not Ready |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Landing page / UX | Genesis | User feedback says differentiation not landing. Needs design work. |
| Admin interface | Genesis | v0.1.0 shipped but is early. Needs iteration based on real usage. |
| Observability / SA | Genesis | Raw events recording but no aggregation or dashboards. |
| Multilingual support | Genesis | 4 languages, 80+ strings, but no user testing of translations. |
| Theme system | Genesis | Themes defined but not fully implemented or tested. |
| Large file transfer | Genesis | Architecture not yet designed. |
| Design / brand identity | Genesis | Design agency not yet briefed. |
| Issues FS integration | Genesis | Just starting adoption. |
| Cache service | Genesis | IN_MEMORY mode works but not yet integrated with production S3. |

### Handover Format

Per the Architect's recommendation (AD-2), handover briefs go to:

```
team/roles/explorer/handovers/{version}__handover__{component}.md
```

Sections: component overview, architecture, known limitations, performance characteristics, test coverage, configuration, maturity assessment.

### Handover Decision Required

The Architect flagged three architectural decisions (AD-1, AD-2, AD-3) that need resolution before handover:

| Decision | Status | Explorer Action |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **AD-1: Environment separation** | Architect recommends Option B (same account, separate resources). Needs Dinis approval. | Flag to Dinis. Explorer does not need to resolve -- this is Villager infrastructure. |
| **AD-2: Handover brief format** | Architect proposed format. | Adopt the proposed format. Explorer writes the first handover briefs using it. |
| **AD-3: Branching strategy** | Architect recommends Option A (Explorer on `dev`, Villager on `release/*`). Needs Dinis approval. | Flag to Dinis. Explorer continues on `dev` regardless. |

## 7. What Carries Forward from v0.3.0 Sprint Plan

### Resolved / Completed from v0.3.0

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Admin UI v0.1.0 (3 panels) | SHIPPED |
| Gate G8 (Admin UI functional) | CLEARED |
| Token Management panel | DONE |
| Analytics Dashboard panel | DONE |
| System Info panel | DONE |
| Admin UI Authentication (cookie-based) | DONE |

### Carries Forward (Now Explorer Responsibility)

| Item from v0.3.0 | New Priority | Explorer Action |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Token gate i18n bug (F015) | P2 | Remains open. Fix when landing page work begins. |
| Landing page content integration | P2 (now Stream D) | Elevated -- user feedback makes this more urgent. |
| Playwright E2E tests | Deferred to Villager | E2E testing of stable features is Villager territory. |
| IFD v0.2.0 consolidation (tech debt) | Deferred to Villager | Consolidation of minor versions into release is Villager output. |
| LETS aggregation cascade | Deferred | Still future work. Raw events + pulse sufficient. |
| CloudFront log ingestion (RF-22) | Deferred to Villager | Production observability is Villager territory. |

### Risk Register Carries Forward

Active risks from v0.3.0 that remain relevant to Explorer:

| ID | Risk | Status | Explorer Relevance |
|----|------|--------|--------------------|
| RF-24 | LinkedIn traffic hits unpolished UI | ACTIVE | Landing page work (Stream D) addresses this. |
| RF-29 | Admin UI API key in browser | ACTIVE (AppSec reviewed) | Explorer monitors. Villager hardens for production. |
| RF-32 | Over-engineering delays shipment | MITIGATED | Still applies. Explorer must resist scope creep. |

### New Risks for Explorer Track

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|----|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| RF-33 | **Architect bottleneck** -- Architect is in 3 of 4 parallel streams | HIGH | Medium | Sequence Architect work carefully (Section 5). First: design agency input. Then: handovers. Then: research. |
| RF-34 | **Design agency brief delays** -- external partner waiting, brief not ready | Medium | High | P1 priority. Designer starts as soon as Architect delivers technical context. Time-box to 2-3 sessions. |
| RF-35 | **Issues FS format mismatch** -- old JSON format and new flat-file format coexist | Low | Low | Keep both. Flat files are the working format. Old JSON structure is reference/tooling. |
| RF-36 | **Handover briefs insufficient** -- Villager team cannot productise from Explorer documentation | Medium | High | Adopt Architect's proposed format. Villager reviews handover briefs and requests clarification before accepting. |

---

## 8. Explorer Team Metrics

As the Explorer role definition says, we need to track health signals:

| Metric | Current Baseline | Target |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| **Pace of discovery** | High -- MVP shipped in 2 days, 452 files | Maintain -- 1 significant learning per session |
| **Handover brief quality** | None yet -- first handovers are upcoming | Villager can productise without basic questions back to Explorer |
| **Issue backlog shape** | Unknown -- Issues FS adoption starting now | More tasks completed than created per session (after initial backlog seed) |
| **Failed experiment ratio** | Low -- most experiments have succeeded | Some failures expected as we explore large files, bot integration |
| **Maturity progression** | 5 components at Custom-Built, 9 at Genesis | Move 2-3 Genesis components toward Custom-Built per sprint |

---

## 9. Session Success Criteria

This action plan covers multiple sessions. Success criteria per session:

### Session 1 (Issues FS + Architect Foundation)

| # | Criterion | Verification |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | 6 `.issues` files created and seeded | Files exist in `.issues/` with initial tasks |
| 2 | Architect delivers technical context for design agency brief | Document exists, Designer can start |
| 3 | Large file transfer architecture brief produced | Design document captures chunked upload, retry, checksum approach |

### Session 2 (Design Agency Brief)

| # | Criterion | Verification |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 4 | Design agency brief complete with all sections | Brief covers context, requirements, constraints, logistics |
| 5 | Advocate and Ambassador inputs integrated | User persona and positioning sections present |
| 6 | Issues files updated with progress | `.issues/explorer-design-agency.issues` reflects completed tasks |

### Session 3 (Handover + Presentation)

| # | Criterion | Verification |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 7 | At least 3 of 5 handover briefs written | Briefs at `team/roles/explorer/handovers/` |
| 8 | Kickoff presentation complete | Visual deck ready for design agency |
| 9 | Cartographer updates evolution map | Map reflects handover status of mature components |

### Stretch Goals (If Sessions Move Fast)

| # | Goal | Priority |
|---|------|----------|
| S1 | All 5 handover briefs complete | P1 |
| S2 | Landing page wireframes started | P2 |
| S3 | Bot research brief delivered | P2 |
| S4 | Slack/WhatsApp research brief delivered | P3 |

---

## 10. Decisions for Dinis

The following decisions need human input. They are flagged here for the next brief or interaction:

| # | Decision | Options | Architect Recommendation | Blocking? |
|---|----------|---------|-------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | Environment separation strategy (AD-1) | A: separate AWS accounts, B: same account/separate resources, C: separate stacks | B (same account, naming conventions) | Blocks Villager, not Explorer |
| 2 | Branching strategy for two teams (AD-3) | A: Explorer on `dev`/Villager on `release/*`, B: Explorer on `dev`/Villager on `main`, C: separate repos | A (`dev` + `release/*`) | Blocks Villager, not Explorer |
| 3 | Handover brief format (AD-2) | Architect proposed format | Adopt as proposed | Not blocking -- Explorer will use proposed format and adjust based on Villager feedback |
| 4 | Unencrypted mode (from brief P3) | Default encrypted + opt-out, or encrypted only | No recommendation yet -- Advocate and AppSec need to evaluate | Not blocking -- P3 |

---

## 11. Summary

The Explorer track has four clear workstreams, properly sequenced:

1. **Issues FS** (P1, immediate) -- the tracking system for everything else
2. **Design Agency** (P1, time-sensitive) -- external partner needs a brief and presentation
3. **Handover Briefs** (P1, critical path for Villager) -- the mature components need documentation
4. **Research + Landing Page** (P2) -- large files, bots, positioning

The Architect is the bottleneck. Sequence their work: design agency input first, then handovers, then research. The Designer is the critical path for the design agency brief. The Conductor tracks everything via Issues FS.

**The Explorer team's job is to push the frontier while handing mature components to the Villager team.** This plan ensures both happen in parallel.

---

*Next Conductor document: after Session 1 completes (Issues FS bootstrapped, Architect foundation delivered), or if a blocker emerges.*
