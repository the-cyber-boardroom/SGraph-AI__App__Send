## Standing Directive

**Ship the admin UI. Limit planning overhead.**

The backend is done. The admin Lambda has five token endpoints (`create`, `lookup`, `use`, `revoke`, `list`) and one analytics endpoint (`/health/pulse`). The admin UI is a single line of placeholder text: `"IFD version v0.1.0 will go here"`. That placeholder becomes a working admin console today.

Every role response in this session must be actionable within hours, not days. No multi-page architecture documents. No new schema designs. The schemas exist. The routes exist. The API contract is the code. Build the UI that calls it.

---

## 1. Sprint Plan: v0.3.0

### What Is Done (13-14 Feb Delivered)

The v0.2.24-to-v0.3.0 sprint delivered everything that was planned:

| Deliverable | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Cache service integration (`Send__Cache__Client`) | DONE |
| Token CRUD (`Service__Tokens`, `Routes__Tokens`) | DONE |
| Analytics pulse (`Service__Analytics__Pulse`, `Routes__Analytics`) | DONE |
| Middleware analytics (raw event recording) | DONE |
| Inter-Lambda communication (`Admin__Service__Client` + Service Registry) | DONE |
| Token validation in user transfer routes | DONE |
| Frontend v0.1.1 through v0.1.4 (hash URLs, text mode, i18n, cleanup) | DONE |
| IFD independence analysis + lessons learned | DONE |
| osbot-* ecosystem audit | DONE |
| 111+ tests passing, no mocks | DONE |

All prior Conductor gates (G1 through G7) are either CLEARED or STANDING. RF-23 (zero analytics) moved from ACTIVE to MITIGATED -- raw events are recording and pulse is answering "is anyone using the site?"

### What Ships Now: Admin UI v0.1.0

One deliverable. One session. One version.

```
sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__admin/v0/v0.1/v0.1.0/index.html
                                                  ^
                                                  |
                                    Currently: placeholder text
                                    Target:    working admin console
```

The admin UI v0.1.0 has three panels:

| Panel | Backend Endpoint(s) | What It Shows |
|-------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Token Management** | `POST /tokens/create`, `GET /tokens/list`, `GET /tokens/lookup/{name}`, `POST /tokens/revoke/{name}` | Create tokens with usage limits, view all tokens, view token details (usage count, status, creation date), revoke tokens |
| **Analytics Dashboard** | `GET /health/pulse` | Request count for last N minutes, system heartbeat |
| **System Info** | `GET /config/info` or hardcoded version | Version display, service name, deployment target |

### What Does NOT Ship Now

- LETS aggregation cascade (Phase 2 of cache service -- future session)
- CloudFront log ingestion (RF-22 still open -- not blocking)
- Cost tracking dashboard (Phase 5 -- future sprint)
- Landing page content (P2 -- after admin UI)
- Playwright E2E tests (P3 -- after admin UI)
- IFD v0.2.0 consolidation (accepted technical debt, per debrief)

---

## 2. Prioritised Task Stack

Strict ordering. Complete each before starting the next.

```
P0  [1]  Admin UI v0.1.0: Token Management panel
         - Token list view (call GET /tokens/list, render table)
         - Token create form (call POST /tokens/create)
         - Token detail/lookup (call GET /tokens/lookup/{name})
         - Token revoke action (call POST /tokens/revoke/{name})

P0  [2]  Admin UI v0.1.0: Analytics Dashboard panel
         - Pulse display (call GET /health/pulse, show request count)
         - Auto-refresh on configurable interval

P0  [3]  Admin UI v0.1.0: System Info panel
         - Version display
         - Service health indicator

P1  [4]  Admin UI: Authentication
         - API key header injection on all fetch calls
         - Login/auth state handling (read from env or config)

P1  [5]  Admin UI: Smoke tests
         - QA verifies all three panels render
         - QA verifies API calls succeed against in-memory admin stack
         - QA verifies IFD compliance (v0.1.0 path structure correct)

P2  [6]  Token gate i18n bug (F015)
         - Known bug, deferred from v0.1.4
         - Ship after admin UI if time permits

P3  [7]  Landing page content integration
         - Journalist copy ready
         - Dev integrates via i18n keys
```

### Task Sizing

| Task | Estimated Effort | Complexity |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| [1] Token Management panel | 2-3 hours | Medium -- 4 API calls, table + form |
| [2] Analytics Dashboard panel | 1 hour | Low -- 1 API call, number display |
| [3] System Info panel | 30 min | Low -- static or 1 call |
| [4] Authentication | 1 hour | Low-Medium -- header injection pattern |
| [5] Smoke tests | 1 hour | Low -- verify rendering + API calls |
| **Total** | **5.5-6.5 hours** | |

This is a single-session deliverable.

## 3. Risk Register Update

### Resolved Risks (from previous sessions)

| ID | Risk | Previous Status | New Status | Notes |
|----|------|----------------|-----------|-------|
| RF-23 | Zero analytics on publicly-announced product | ACTIVE (P0) | **MITIGATED** | Raw events recording via `Middleware__Analytics`. Pulse endpoint operational. Two essential questions answerable. |
| RF-15 | Cache service schema delay | SUPERSEDED | **CLOSED** | Cache service implemented, tested, deployed. |
| RF-25 | Plan-to-execution ratio too high | ACTIVE | **MITIGATED** | v0.2.24-to-v0.3.0 sprint delivered 452 files, 50+ commits. This session continues the execution bias. |

### Active Risks

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|----|------|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|
| RF-17 | GA removed before server-side analytics ready | MATERIALISED | Accepted | Pulse endpoint provides minimum viable replacement. Raw events accumulating. Gap accepted per DPO/AppSec recommendation. | **ACCEPTED** |
| RF-18 | LETS aggregation correctness | Medium | Medium | Deferred to future session. Raw events + pulse sufficient for now. | **OPEN -- not blocking** |
| RF-19 | Cache service performance bottleneck | Low | Low | IN_MEMORY mode in use. Monitor cold starts. | **ACCEPTED** |
| RF-20 | IFD compliance slows UI delivery | Medium | Low | Accepted by design. Admin UI is a single v0.1.0 -- no IFD versioning complexity yet. | **ACCEPTED** |
| RF-22 | No CloudFront logs flowing | Medium | Medium | Application-level analytics (Lambda middleware) covers the gap. CloudFront logs are additive, not blocking. | **ACTIVE** |
| RF-24 | LinkedIn traffic spike hits unpolished UI | Low | Medium | User UI v0.1.4 is functional. Landing page content is P2. | **ACTIVE** |
| RF-26 | External dependency on mgraph-ai cache packages | Medium | Medium | IN_MEMORY mode, no network dependency. Versions pinned. | **ACCEPTED** |
| RF-27 | Lambda package size increase | Low | Low | Monitor cold starts. | **MONITOR** |
| RF-28 | Shared S3 bucket prefix isolation | Low | Medium | `admin/` vs `user/` prefix convention enforced. | **MONITOR** |

### New Risks from Admin UI Work

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|----|------|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|
| RF-29 | **Admin UI exposes API key in browser** | Medium | Critical | API key must be injected server-side or via a secure configuration endpoint, never hardcoded in HTML/JS. AppSec must review before any production deployment of admin UI. The admin Lambda already uses `SGRAPH_SEND__ACCESS_TOKEN` -- the UI must pass this as a header, and the key value must come from a configuration mechanism, not from the page source. | **ACTIVE -- AppSec review required** |
| RF-30 | **Admin UI accessible without authentication** | Low | High | The admin Lambda already enforces API key auth on all routes. The UI is served as static assets, but all data-fetching calls require the auth header. Verify that no admin endpoint returns data without authentication. | **MITIGATED by existing auth** |
| RF-31 | **IFD broken independence pattern repeats in admin UI** | Medium | Low | Admin UI v0.1.0 is the base version -- no independence issue at v0.1.0 since there are no prior versions. The lessons from the v0.2.41 debrief apply at v0.1.1 onwards. For now, this is not a concern. | **ACCEPTED -- monitor at v0.1.1** |
| RF-32 | **Admin UI over-engineering delays shipment** | Medium | Medium | This Conductor directive explicitly limits scope to three panels, vanilla JS, Web Components. No framework, no build tools, no state management library. The brief says "ship." | **MITIGATED by scope constraint** |

## 4. Role Activation Directives

### Activation Order

Roles activate in this sequence. Each role produces exactly one document (or no document if the brief doesn't require written output from them).

```
WAVE 1 (Parallel -- Start Immediately)
  [A] Architect  -- Admin UI component architecture (concise: component list, API mapping, no new schemas)
  [B] AppSec     -- Admin UI security review (focus: API key handling in browser, RF-29)

WAVE 2 (After Wave 1 -- Implementation)
  [C] Dev        -- Implement admin UI v0.1.0 (the main deliverable)

WAVE 3 (After Dev ships -- Verification & Documentation)
  [D] QA         -- Smoke test admin UI, verify IFD compliance
  [E] Librarian  -- Update master index for v0.3.0, catalogue new documents
  [F] Cartographer -- Update system landscape map (add admin UI, inter-Lambda flow)

WAVE 4 (Parallel with Wave 3 -- Record & Communicate)
  [G] Historian  -- Record v0.3.0 milestone, velocity metrics
  [H] Journalist -- Prepare v0.3.0 release notes, draft admin console LinkedIn post
```

### What Each Role Delivers

| Wave | Role | Deliverable | Max Length | Time Budget |
|------|------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Architect** | Component architecture for admin UI v0.1.0. List the Web Components, their responsibilities, and which API endpoints they call. Include the auth pattern (how API key gets from config to fetch headers). | 2 pages max | 30 min |
| 1 | **AppSec** | Security review of admin UI. Focus on RF-29 (API key exposure). Confirm that admin routes enforce auth. Recommend the API key injection pattern for the browser. | 1-2 pages | 30 min |
| 2 | **Dev** | Working admin UI at `sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__admin/v0/v0.1/v0.1.0/index.html`. Three panels (tokens, analytics, system info). Vanilla JS, Web Components, zero dependencies. | Code deliverable | 4-5 hours |
| 3 | **QA** | Smoke test report. IFD compliance checklist (v0.1.0 path correct, no prior version to break). Admin API endpoint verification. | 1 page | 1 hour |
| 3 | **Librarian** | Updated master index. New documents catalogued from this session. | Standard format | 30 min |
| 3 | **Cartographer** | Updated system landscape map showing admin UI calling admin Lambda endpoints. | Map update | 30 min |
| 4 | **Historian** | Decision record for v0.3.0 milestone. Velocity metrics captured. | 1 page | 30 min |
| 4 | **Journalist** | v0.3.0 release notes. Short LinkedIn draft about admin console. | 1 page each | 30 min |

### Roles NOT Activated This Session

| Role | Why Not |
|------|---------|
| **DevOps** | No infrastructure changes needed. Admin Lambda already serves static assets. If serving doesn't work, Dev escalates to DevOps. |
| **Sherpa** | Admin user journey mapping is valuable but not urgent. Admin users are internal (Dinis + team). Ship first, map journey later. |
| **Ambassador** | Enterprise differentiator assessment deferred. Ship the UI first, then assess. |
| **Advocate** | Accessibility review deferred to v0.1.1. v0.1.0 is a functional baseline. |
| **DPO** | IP hash approach already reviewed and approved. Admin analytics uses the same pipeline. No new data handling introduced. |

---

## 5. Session Success Criteria

The session is complete when ALL of the following are true:

| # | Criterion | Verification Method |
|---|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Admin UI v0.1.0 renders in browser at `/admin/v0/v0.1/v0.1.0/index.html` | Navigate to URL, page loads without errors |
| 2 | Token list panel displays tokens from `GET /tokens/list` | Create a test token, verify it appears in the list |
| 3 | Token create form successfully calls `POST /tokens/create` | Fill form, submit, token appears in list |
| 4 | Token revoke action calls `POST /tokens/revoke/{name}` | Revoke a token, verify status changes |
| 5 | Analytics pulse panel displays request count from `GET /health/pulse` | Panel shows a number, auto-refreshes |
| 6 | All API calls include authentication header | Browser dev tools show auth header on requests |
| 7 | Admin UI file is at the correct IFD path | `v0/v0.1/v0.1.0/index.html` exists and is the served page |
| 8 | All existing tests still pass (111+) | `pytest` green |
| 9 | No API key values hardcoded in HTML or JS source | View source, search for key values -- none found |

### Stretch Goals (If Time Permits)

| # | Goal | Priority |
|---|------|----------|
| S1 | Token detail view (click token name to see full details via `GET /tokens/lookup/{name}`) | P1 |
| S2 | Token usage event history display | P2 |
| S3 | Token gate i18n fix (F015) | P2 |
| S4 | System info panel shows version from backend | P3 |

## 7. Decisions Active This Session

No new architectural decisions are needed. The following existing decisions govern this work:

| # | Decision | Implication for Admin UI |
|---|----------|--------------------------|
| D032 | Admin UI uses modular event-driven architecture | Web Components, each panel is a component |
| D028 | IFD is a merge gate | v0.1.0 path structure must be correct |
| D033 | Designer maps to Dev | Dev implements the UI directly |
| D034 | Cache service IN_MEMORY mode | Admin UI calls local endpoints, no external service dependency |

---

## 8. Coordination Notes

### For the Architect
Design the component structure. Keep it minimal. Suggested components:
- `<admin-console>` -- top-level layout, holds panels
- `<token-manager>` -- token CRUD panel
- `<analytics-pulse>` -- pulse display
- `<system-info>` -- version and health

Map each component to its API endpoints. Define the auth header injection pattern. Do not create new backend schemas or endpoints.

### For AppSec
The critical question: how does the admin UI get the API key? Options:
1. User enters it in a login form (stored in sessionStorage)
2. Server injects it into the page via a template variable
3. A separate auth endpoint returns a session token

Recommend one. The Dev needs this answer before implementing API calls.

### For the Dev
Build the admin UI using the Architect's component structure and AppSec's auth recommendation. Reference:
- `sgraph_ai_app_send/lambda__admin/fast_api/routes/Routes__Tokens.py` for the token API contract
- `sgraph_ai_app_send/lambda__admin/fast_api/routes/Routes__Analytics.py` for the pulse API contract
- `sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__user/v0/v0.1/v0.1.4/` for IFD structure reference (user UI)
- `library/guides/development/ifd/` for IFD methodology

The UI must be a single `index.html` with embedded JS and CSS (or with co-located files in the same v0.1.0 directory). Zero external dependencies. Zero build tools.

### For QA
After Dev delivers, verify:
1. IFD checklist (path structure, version in path, no prior version broken)
2. All five token endpoints callable from the UI
3. Pulse endpoint callable from the UI
4. Auth header present on every API call
5. No credentials in page source

---

## 9. Timeline

```
HOUR 0-1:    Architect + AppSec deliver design + security review (Wave 1)
HOUR 1-5:    Dev implements admin UI v0.1.0 (Wave 2)
HOUR 5-6:    QA smoke tests + Librarian/Cartographer updates (Wave 3)
HOUR 6-7:    Historian + Journalist record and communicate (Wave 4)
```

Total session: approximately 7 hours across all roles (Dev is the critical path at 4-5 hours).

---

## 10. Summary

The v0.3.0 sprint marks a milestone: from v0.1.3 MVP to a fully instrumented, multi-Lambda platform in two days. The backend is complete. The admin UI is the gap.

This session has one job: replace the placeholder text in `sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__admin/v0/v0.1/v0.1.0/index.html` with a working admin console that manages tokens and displays analytics.

The Architect designs the components (30 min). AppSec clears the auth pattern (30 min). Dev builds it (4-5 hours). QA verifies it (1 hour). Everyone else documents and communicates.

**Ship the admin UI. Limit planning overhead.**

---

*Next Conductor document: after admin UI v0.1.0 ships (Gate G8 cleared), or if a blocker emerges during implementation.*
