# Master Roadmap: Team Expansion and Workstreams

**version** v0.2.16
**date** 12 Feb 2026
**role** Conductor + Architect (joint review)
**source** 10 briefs from `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/12/`

---

## Executive Summary

Dinis Cruz's 12 Feb 2026 briefs define a significant expansion of the SGraph Send project across three dimensions:

1. **Team expansion** -- 4 new roles (Advocate, Sherpa, Ambassador, DPO) bridging the product-to-user gap
2. **Operational readiness** -- observability, privacy compliance, incident response, and synthetic monitoring
3. **Feature expansion** -- UI/design improvements, public key encryption, text mode, self-hosted scenarios, user research

This document maps all identified workstreams, their dependencies, proposed sequencing, sizing, and risk flags. It serves as the single coordination reference for the Conductor's sequencing decisions and the team's execution.

## Part 1: New Role Activation

### Roles to Activate

| # | Role | Brief Source | Folder to Create | Key First Tasks |
|---|------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| R1 | **Advocate** | `v0.2.16__role-definition__advocate.md` | `team/roles/advocate/` | ROLE.md, .issues/, review existing personas, review last 5 design decisions, establish NPS baseline |
| R2 | **Sherpa** | `v0.2.16__role-definition__sherpa.md` | `team/roles/sherpa/` | ROLE.md, .issues/, map first-time user journey, produce friction map, define trail telemetry requirements |
| R3 | **Ambassador** | `v0.2.16__role-definition__ambassador.md` | `team/roles/ambassador/` | ROLE.md, .issues/, competitive landscape mapping, viral loop analysis, define growth metrics baselines |
| R4 | **DPO** | `v0.2.16__role-definition__dpo.md` | `team/roles/dpo/` | ROLE.md, .issues/, IP address audit across AWS, current-state privacy wording, begin GA DPIA |

### Activation Work Per Role

Each new role requires:
- Create `team/roles/{role}/` directory
- Create `ROLE.md` (content provided in the brief)
- Create `.issues/` directory with initial `issue.json`
- Create `reviews/` directory
- Register in Issues FS as an entity
- Create initial task issues in the role's `.issues/` database
- First review document: role activation report

**Size estimate:** S per role (scaffolding), M per role (first substantive deliverable)
**Total role activation:** M (can be parallelised across 4 agents)

## Part 4: Proposed Execution Waves

### Wave 0: Immediate (can start today)
**Goal:** Activate new roles, start quick wins, unblock downstream work.

| Workstream | What Happens | Who | Duration Est. |
|-----------|-------------|-----|---------------|
| R1-R4 | Activate all 4 new roles (folders, ROLE.md, .issues/) | Librarian + each role agent | 1 day |
| WS-10 | Text mode -- quick win, ship with friendlies MVP | Dev | 1-2 days |

### Wave 1: Foundation (days 1-5)
**Goal:** Establish privacy posture, observability, and friendlies-release foundations.

| Workstream | What Happens | Who | Duration Est. |
|-----------|-------------|-----|---------------|
| WS-1 | DPO IP address audit + current-state privacy wording | DPO | 3-5 days |

| WS-8 | Define personas, design pre-use questionnaire, create GPT brief | Advocate + Ambassador | 3-5 days |

### Wave 2: Integration (days 5-12)
**Goal:** GA goes live (with DPO approval), observability dashboards operational, UI improvements landed.

| Workstream | What Happens | Who | Duration Est. |
|-----------|-------------|-----|---------------|
| WS-2 | Google Analytics integration (with DPO review gate) | Dev + DPO | 2-3 days |
| WS-3 | Dashboards operational; Sherpa trail requirements met | DevOps + Sherpa | 3-5 days |

|-----------|-------------|-----|---------------|
| WS-5 | Synthetic user personas defined, Playwright scripts written | QA + Advocate + Sherpa | 5-7 days |
| WS-16 | Friendlies outreach campaign ready; first invites sent | Ambassador + Sherpa | 3-5 days |
| WS-9 | Public key encryption -- architecture design + threat model | Architect + AppSec | 5-7 days (design only) |
| WS-1 | DPIA for GA + observability completed | DPO | 3-5 days |

### Wave 4: Stress Test (days 20-30)
**Goal:** Prove the whole system under adversarial conditions.

| Workstream | What Happens | Who | Duration Est. |
|-----------|-------------|-----|---------------|
| WS-4 | Tabletop exercise -- total AWS compromise | CISO + all roles | 5-10 days |
| WS-5 | Synthetic users running on schedule; bellwether active | QA + DevOps | ongoing |
| WS-9 | Public key encryption -- implementation begins | Dev | 7-14 days |

---

## Part 5: Risk Flags

| # | Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|------|--------|-----------|
| RF-1 | **S3 storage not ready** -- blocks friendlies release (WS-7, WS-16). Currently in-memory only; cross-Lambda file access fails. | HIGH -- friendlies release cannot proceed without persistent storage | Dev agent is actively building this. Track daily. This is the single biggest blocker. |
| RF-2 | **DPO IP audit reveals extensive logging** -- may require significant AWS reconfiguration before we can make honest privacy claims | MEDIUM -- could delay GA integration and friendlies privacy wording | Start audit immediately; have DevOps ready with log-disabling scripts |
| RF-3 | **Playwright service architecture undefined** -- blocks synthetic users (WS-5) and Playwright-as-a-service (WS-6) | MEDIUM -- Architect must produce design doc before Dev can build | Architect prioritises this in Wave 0 |
| RF-4 | **Role activation overhead** -- 4 new roles means 4 new agents needing context, coordination, and initial deliverables | LOW-MEDIUM -- coordination cost; conductor overhead increases | Stagger activation: DPO and Advocate first (most urgent), then Sherpa and Ambassador |
| RF-5 | **Tabletop exercise scope creep** -- XL workstream involving every role; could consume disproportionate time | MEDIUM -- risk of derailing other work if not time-boxed | Time-box to 5 working days maximum; use Issues FS to capture gaps for future iterations |
| RF-6 | **Public key encryption complexity** -- XL workstream with significant crypto implications; client-side key management is non-trivial | LOW (for now) -- design phase only in near term | Keep in design-only mode until Waves 0-3 are complete; AppSec threat model before any implementation |
| RF-7 | **No Designer role activated yet** -- the briefs reference a Designer role definition to be provided but it has not arrived | MEDIUM -- blocks WS-7 branding and UI improvements | Conductor should request Designer role definition from Dinis Cruz or proceed with Dev-led UI improvements |
| RF-8 | **GA4 cookie behaviour unknown** -- brief flags uncertainty about whether GA4 places cookies | MEDIUM -- PECR compliance implications; may need cookie consent banner | DPO to verify GA4 behaviour as first task in WS-2 |

## Part 7: Critical Path

The critical path to friendlies release runs through:

```
S3 Storage (in progress)
        |
        v
  SPA Routing (WS-14)
        |
        v
  UI/Design Improvements (WS-7)  +  Sharing UX (WS-13)
        |                                   |
        v                                   v
  DPO Privacy Wording (WS-1) -----> Friendlies Release (WS-16)
        |
        v
  GA Integration (WS-2) -- deployed after friendlies go-live
```

The critical path to operational readiness runs through:

```
DPO Activation (R4)  +  AWS Observability (WS-3)
        |                        |
        v                        v
  DPO Audit (WS-1) ---> Playwright Service (WS-6)
        |                        |
        v                        v
  GA Integration (WS-2)   Synthetic Users (WS-5)
        |                        |
        v________________________v
                    |
                    v
          Tabletop Exercise (WS-4)
```

## Part 8: Next Steps for Conductor

1. **Immediately**: Activate DPO and Advocate roles (highest priority -- they unblock the most downstream work)
2. **Immediately**: Confirm S3 storage status with Dev agent (critical path blocker)
3. **Today**: Request Designer role definition from Dinis Cruz (or clarify if existing role covers this)
4. **Today**: Begin WS-10 (text mode) -- quick win, can ship fast
5. **Today**: Begin WS-6 architecture design (Architect produces Playwright service design doc)
6. **This week**: Activate Sherpa and Ambassador roles
7. **This week**: Begin Wave 1 workstreams in parallel (WS-1, WS-3, WS-14, WS-7, WS-13, WS-8)
