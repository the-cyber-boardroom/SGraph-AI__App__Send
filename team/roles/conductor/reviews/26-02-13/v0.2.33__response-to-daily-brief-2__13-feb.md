# v0.2.33 -- Conductor Response to Daily Brief #2 (13 Feb 2026)

**Version:** v0.2.33
**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Role:** Conductor
**Context:** Response to `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/13/v0.2.32__daily-brief__2__sgraph-send-13-feb-2026.md`
**Follows:** Conductor response to Daily Brief #1 (`v0.2.24__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md`)
**Decisions from Brief #1 still active:** D014-D023 (all remain valid; see Section 8)

---

## 1. Strategic Shift Acknowledged

Daily Brief #2 introduces a fundamental architectural change. The cache service is not a feature -- it is **the platform substrate**. Five previously independent capabilities now converge on a single storage and query pattern:

| Capability | Before (Brief #1) | After (Brief #2) |
|---|---|---|
| File storage | Memory-FS direct | Memory-FS via cache service (cache ID per transfer) |
| Token management | Backend indexed by token string | Cache hash resolution to cache ID, with usage limits |
| Site analytics | Google Analytics (client-side) | Server-side events via cache service + LETS aggregations |
| Event logging | Application logs | Raw event files in cache entries, cascading aggregations |
| Cost tracking | Not planned | AWS cost data in cache service, correlated with traffic |

This is the right call. A unified data backbone eliminates five separate storage models and makes the entire system queryable through one pattern. But it makes the Architect's cache service design the single most critical gating item on the board.

**The other major shift: Google Analytics is out.** This simplifies DPO compliance (no third-party processor, no cookies, no consent banners), strengthens the privacy posture, and removes a dependency. But GA removal is sequenced -- it happens only after server-side analytics can answer the two essential questions: "Is anyone using the site right now?" and "How many people used the site today?"

---

## 2. Updated Execution Plan (Briefs #1 + #2 Integrated)

The Brief #1 plan had five phases (A through F). Brief #2 restructures the middle phases around the cache service and adds new workstreams. The updated plan has seven phases.

### Phase 0: Cache Service Architecture (GATING -- Immediate)

**This blocks everything new in Brief #2.** Nothing from Brief #2 can be implemented until the Architect delivers the cache service schema.

```
Architect: Cache service schema design
  - Cache ID structure and generation
  - Cache hash algorithm and collision handling
  - Temporal storage paths (year/month/day/hour + latest)
  - LETS pipeline mechanics (trigger model: on-demand vs scheduled vs event-driven)
  - Schema for: site analytics entries, token entries, cost entries, file transfer entries
           |
           | GATE: schema review by AppSec (security of hash resolution)
           |       schema review by QA (testability of temporal storage)
           |
           v
    Unblocks: ALL of Phases 2, 3, 4, 5
```

**Acceptance criteria:** A written design document covering cache ID format, cache hash derivation, temporal path structure, LETS pipeline trigger model, and entry schemas for all five use cases. Reviewed by AppSec and QA before Dev begins implementation.

**Owner:** Architect (lead), AppSec (review), QA (review)
**Estimate:** 1 day for design, 0.5 days for review cycle

### Phase 1: Brief #1 P1 Items (Continue -- In Progress)

These items from Brief #1 are already unblocked and should continue in parallel with Phase 0:

```
Dev: Hash-fragment URLs (2-3h)        [APPROVED by Architect + AppSec in Brief #1]
Dev: Text input mode (4-6h)            [APPROVED in Brief #1]
Dev: i18n foundation (6-8h)            [APPROVED -- must complete before Phase 6 content]
DevOps: Enable Tier 1 AWS logging      [APPROVED -- <$1/month]
```

These do NOT depend on the cache service and should proceed immediately. The hash-fragment work and text input are the highest-priority user-facing changes from Brief #1.

### Phase 2: Cache Service Core Implementation (Days 2-5)

**Depends on:** Phase 0 (schema design complete)

```
Dev: Implement cache service on Memory-FS
  - Cache ID generation + file tree structure
  - Cache hash derivation + resolution to cache ID
  - Temporal storage (write to date path + latest simultaneously)
  - LETS pipeline: Load raw files, Extract data, Transform into aggregation, Save result
           |
           v
QA: Cache service unit tests
  - In-memory Memory-FS (no mocks, per project rules)
  - Test cache hash collision handling
  - Test temporal path correctness (year/month/day/hour boundaries)
  - Test LETS aggregation cascading (30min -> hourly -> daily)
```

**Acceptance criteria:** Cache service passes all unit tests. Can store, retrieve, and aggregate data through all three access patterns (cache ID direct, cache hash resolution, temporal query). Tests run in-memory in <100ms.

**Owner:** Dev (lead), QA (tests)
**Estimate:** 3-4 days implementation, 1-2 days testing (overlapping)

### Phase 3: Server-Side Analytics + GA Removal (Days 4-8)

**Depends on:** Phase 2 (cache service core), DevOps Tier 1 logging (from Phase 1)

```
Dev + DevOps: Wire event sources into cache service
  - CloudFront access logs -> cache entries (IP addresses hashed, per DPO requirement)
  - Lambda execution logs -> cache entries
  - Application events (file created/viewed/downloaded, token used) -> cache entries
           |
           v
Dev: LETS aggregation pipeline for site analytics
  - 30-minute aggregation (page views, unique visitors by IP hash, top pages)
  - Hourly / daily / monthly cascade
  - "Latest" folder always has current state
           |
           v
Dev: Minimal analytics dashboard (Admin UI)
  - Real-time pulse: "X requests in the last 30 minutes"
  - Today count: "Y visitors today"
  - IFD: v0/v0.1/v0.1.0 -- first version, single page
           |
           | GATE: Dashboard answers the two essential questions
           |
           v
Dev: Remove Google Analytics
  - Delete GA script tags
  - Delete cookie consent code (if any)
  - Update privacy policy to state "no cookies, no third-party tracking"
```

**The GA removal gate is explicit:** Server-side analytics must answer "Is anyone using the site right now?" and "How many people used the site today?" before GA is removed. This is not feature parity with GA -- it is the minimum viable replacement.

**DPO + GRC (AppSec):** Produce the formal GA removal recommendation in parallel. This is documentation, not a blocker -- the decision is already made. The formal analysis provides the compliance paper trail.

**Owner:** Dev (lead), DevOps (log pipeline), DPO (formal analysis), GRC/AppSec (risk assessment)
**Estimate:** 3-4 days for pipeline + dashboard, 0.5 days for GA removal

### Phase 4: Token System Enhancement (Days 5-9)

**Depends on:** Phase 2 (cache service core)

```
Architect: Token-to-cache-hash resolution design (from Phase 0 schema)
           |
           v
Dev: Implement enhanced token system
  - Human-friendly token names (no GUIDs)
  - Token string -> cache hash -> cache ID resolution
  - Usage limit enforcement (check count vs limit, increment, reject if exceeded)
  - Usage event recording in cache entry (timestamp, IP hash, outcome)
  - Admin token creation UI (IFD versioned)
  - Admin token dashboard: active tokens, usage counts, limits, events
           |
           v
QA: Token system tests
  - Token creation with name and limit
  - Hash resolution finds correct cache entry
  - Usage limit enforcement (allow, reject at limit, reject over limit)
  - Concurrent usage race condition handling
```

**This supersedes the Brief #1 admin token work.** The Brief #1 token schema (indexed by token string) is replaced by the cache-hash-resolved model. Dev should implement the Brief #2 version directly, not build Brief #1's version and then migrate.

**Owner:** Architect (design), Dev (implementation), QA (tests)
**Estimate:** 3-4 days

### Phase 5: AWS Cost Capture (Days 6-10)

**Depends on:** Phase 2 (cache service core)

```
DevOps: AWS cost data collection
  - Cost Explorer API data -> cache service entries
  - Collector pattern: track high-water mark, only fetch new data
  - Daily/weekly/monthly aggregations via LETS
           |
           v
Dev: Cost correlation
  - Cost per request, cost per file transfer, cost per active user
  - Unit economics dashboard in Admin UI (IFD versioned)
```

**Owner:** DevOps (collection), Dev (correlation + UI), Architect (schema from Phase 0)
**Estimate:** 2-3 days

### Phase 6: UI Workstreams (Days 5-12)

**Depends on:** i18n foundation (from Phase 1), IFD compliance gate (see Section 4)

All UI work from both briefs is consolidated here. Every item must pass the IFD gate.

```
PARALLEL TRACKS (all follow IFD, all use i18n):

Track A: Local Storage Transparency Panel
  Dev (Designer role): Design + implement transparency panel
    - Show all localStorage/sessionStorage entries
    - Optional key caching (opt-in, visible, clearable)
    - IFD version: v0/v0.1/v0.1.0
  DPO: Review local key caching privacy implications
  QA: Verify zero-local-storage mode works end-to-end

Track B: Modular Admin UI
  Dev: Event-driven module architecture (from shared code)
    - Dynamic module loading
    - Admin layout with: token management, analytics, event logs, cost dashboard
    - IFD versioned

Track C: Landing Page Content (from Brief #1)
  Journalist (via i18n keys): Landing page copy
  Dev (Designer role): Landing page layout
  Journalist (Advocate role): Review for persona clarity

Track D: Email Sharing (from Brief #1)
  Dev: Copy-as-text + Gmail compose link
  Journalist (Ambassador role): Email template copy
  Depends on: hash-fragment URLs complete (Phase 1)

Track E: Themes (from Brief #1)
  Dev (Designer role): 5 theme palettes (Dark, High Contrast, Aurora, Glacier, Ember)
  Dev: CSS-variable theme switching
  QA: Theme coverage across synthetic users
```

**Owner:** Dev (lead on all tracks), Journalist (content), QA (verification)
**Estimate:** 6-10 days across all tracks (parallel)

### Phase 7: Research + Formal Reviews (Ongoing, Parallel)

```
DPO (AppSec): Formal GA removal analysis + recommendation paper
GRC (AppSec): Risk assessment -- GA removal vs retention
Advocate (Journalist): User trust analysis of zero-cookie positioning
Ambassador (Journalist): Market differentiator analysis of zero-cookie policy
Sherpa (QA): Review local storage panel from onboarding UX perspective
DPO (AppSec): Local key caching privacy review + disclosure requirements
Advocate (Journalist): Domain preference research (.ai vs .com) -- from Brief #1
Dev: Explore zero-local-storage mode (P3)
```

**Owner:** Various (see role mapping in Section 5)
**Estimate:** Ongoing throughout the sprint

## 3. Dependency Map

```
PHASE 0: Cache Service Schema (Architect)
    |
    +------ blocks -----> PHASE 2: Cache Service Implementation (Dev)
    |                         |
    |                         +------ blocks -----> PHASE 3: Server-Side Analytics + GA Removal
    |                         |
    |                         +------ blocks -----> PHASE 4: Token System Enhancement
    |                         |
    |                         +------ blocks -----> PHASE 5: AWS Cost Capture
    |
    |   (independent -- no cache service dependency)
    |
PHASE 1: Brief #1 P1 Items (Dev, DevOps)
    |
    +--- i18n foundation -----> PHASE 6: All UI Work
    |
    +--- hash-fragment URLs --> PHASE 6 Track D: Email Sharing
    |
    +--- Tier 1 logging -----> PHASE 3: Server-Side Analytics (log sources)


IFD COMPLIANCE GATE (see Section 4)
    |
    +------ gates -----> ALL UI work in Phase 6
    +------ gates -----> Analytics dashboard in Phase 3
    +------ gates -----> Token dashboard in Phase 4
    +------ gates -----> Cost dashboard in Phase 5
```

**Critical path:** Phase 0 -> Phase 2 -> Phase 3 (GA removal). This is the longest dependency chain and the path that delivers the Brief #2 headline change (GA out, server-side analytics in). The Architect's schema design is the single point of failure.

---

## 4. IFD Compliance Gate

**This is non-negotiable.** Per the brief: "If a PR does not follow IFD, it does not merge."

### What IFD Compliance Means (Checklist for Every UI PR)

| # | Requirement | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | New version directory created (e.g., `v0/v0.1/v0.1.1/`) | QA checks path structure |
| 2 | Previous version HTML untouched | QA diffs previous version directory -- zero changes |
| 3 | Version number appears in file path | QA verifies path matches version |
| 4 | Previous version remains accessible at its URL | QA navigates to previous version URL |
| 5 | No inline content changes -- all content via i18n keys | QA checks for hardcoded strings |
| 6 | CSS changes use CSS variables or scoped styles | QA reviews for global CSS leaks |

### Enforcement

- **QA** verifies the checklist on every UI PR before merge
- **Conductor** (this role) rejects any UI task completion that does not include IFD verification
- **Dev** is responsible for following IFD but not for self-certifying -- QA is the independent verifier
- The IFD guide at `library/guides/` is the authoritative reference

### Rollback Capability

QA must verify that after any new version is deployed, a user can still access every previous version by URL. This is the IFD payoff: zero-risk UI deployments because nothing is destroyed.

## 5. Role Assignments (All 10 Roles + Aliases)

### Role Aliasing

Brief #2 references roles that map to existing team roles. This avoids role proliferation while ensuring the work gets done.

| Referenced Role | Maps To | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Designer | Dev | Dev implements UI. No separate Designer role. Dev follows IFD and uses existing palettes. |
| Advocate | Journalist | User-perspective content and persona analysis is a Journalist function. |
| Ambassador | Journalist | Market positioning and growth narrative is a Journalist function. |
| Sherpa | QA | Onboarding UX trail analysis is a quality/testing function. |
| GRC | AppSec | Financial risk and compliance risk assessment is an AppSec function. |
| DPO | AppSec | Data protection officer analysis is an AppSec function (privacy is security). |

### Role Assignment Matrix

| Role | Brief #2 Tasks | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| **Architect** | Cache service schema (Phase 0). Token-to-cache-hash resolution. Cost entry schema. Analytics aggregation schema. LETS pipeline trigger model. | **P0** -- everything else blocks on this |
| **Dev** | Cache service implementation (Phase 2). Analytics pipeline (Phase 3). Token system (Phase 4). GA removal (Phase 3). Local storage panel (Phase 6A). Modular admin UI (Phase 6B). Cost correlation (Phase 5). All UI work follows IFD. Continue Brief #1 P1s (Phase 1). | P1 through P3 across phases |
| **QA** | Cache service unit tests. Token system tests. IFD compliance verification on all UI PRs. Previous-version accessibility tests. Analytics aggregation correctness tests. Zero-local-storage mode verification. | P1 -- test alongside implementation |
| **DevOps** | Continue Tier 1 AWS logging (Phase 1). CloudFront log pipeline into cache service (Phase 3). AWS cost data collection (Phase 5). IP masking configuration (coordinate with AppSec/DPO). | P1 |
| **AppSec** | Cache service schema security review (Phase 0). Cache hash collision risk assessment. IP masking verification. Formal GA removal analysis (as DPO). Financial risk assessment of GA removal vs retention (as GRC). Local key caching privacy review (as DPO). | P1 (schema review), P2 (formal analyses) |
| **Librarian** | Index all Brief #2 role responses. Update master index. Update Issues FS with new tasks from Brief #2. Cross-reference Brief #1 and Brief #2 consolidated action items. | P2 |
| **Cartographer** | Update system landscape map: add cache service as central component. Update data flow diagrams: show LETS pipeline, temporal storage paths, cache hash resolution. Remove GA from system map. | P2 |
| **Historian** | Record new decisions from Brief #2 (D024+). Record the strategic shift: cache service becomes platform substrate. Record GA removal decision and rationale. | P2 |
| **Journalist** | Landing page copy via i18n (Phase 6C). Email template copy (Phase 6D). User trust analysis of zero-cookie policy (as Advocate). Market differentiator analysis (as Ambassador). Token allocation narrative for community engagement (as Ambassador). | P2 |
| **Conductor** | Enforce IFD compliance gate. Track Phase 0 completion. Sequence GA removal after analytics minimum bar. Coordinate cross-role dependencies. This document. | Ongoing |

## 6. Gating Items Summary

| Gate | What It Blocks | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **G1: Cache service schema** | All cache-dependent implementation (Phases 2-5) | Architect | **NOT STARTED -- CRITICAL PATH** |
| **G2: Cache service implementation** | Analytics pipeline, token system, cost capture | Dev | Blocked by G1 |
| **G3: Server-side analytics minimum bar** | GA removal | Dev | Blocked by G2 |
| **G4: i18n foundation** | All new UI content (Phase 6) | Dev | In progress (from Brief #1) |
| **G5: IFD compliance** | All UI PRs | QA (verification) | Standing gate -- applies to every UI PR |
| **G6: IP masking configuration** | CloudFront log ingestion | DevOps + AppSec/DPO | Not started |
| **G7: Hash-fragment URLs** | Email sharing (Phase 6D) | Dev | In progress (from Brief #1) |

## 7. Risk Register Update

### New Risks from Brief #2

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|----|------|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|
| RF-15 | Cache service schema delay blocks all Brief #2 work | Medium | Critical | Architect prioritises this above all other work. Conductor monitors daily. Escalate to human if not delivered within 2 days. | **Active -- monitoring** |
| RF-16 | Cache hash collisions in token resolution | Low | High | Architect must specify collision handling in schema design (reject, re-hash, or namespace). AppSec reviews. | **Open -- pending Phase 0** |
| RF-17 | GA removed before server-side analytics is ready | Low | Medium | Explicit gate (G3): GA stays until analytics answers the two essential questions. No exceptions. | **Mitigated by sequencing** |
| RF-18 | LETS aggregation correctness (cascading errors) | Medium | Medium | QA tests aggregation at every level (30min, hourly, daily). Known-input test fixtures with pre-computed expected outputs. | **Open -- pending Phase 2** |
| RF-19 | Cache service becomes a performance bottleneck | Low | High | Cache service is built on Memory-FS which is already proven. Temporal writes are append-only. Aggregation reads are pre-computed. Monitor latency in production. | **Accepted -- monitor** |
| RF-20 | IFD compliance slows UI delivery | Medium | Low | IFD is an investment: slower per-version, but zero-risk deployments and full rollback. The brief is explicit: non-negotiable. | **Accepted by design** |
| RF-21 | Scope expansion: five cache service consumers in one sprint | High | Medium | Strict phasing. Analytics first (Phase 3), then tokens (Phase 4), then cost (Phase 5). Do not parallelise cache consumers until core is proven. | **Mitigated by sequencing** |
| RF-22 | No CloudFront logs flowing yet (dependency for server-side analytics) | Medium | Medium | DevOps Tier 1 logging is already approved and budgeted (<$1/month). Activate immediately. Application events alone can answer the two essential questions while CloudFront logs are being configured. | **Active -- workaround available** |

### Updated Status of Brief #1 Risks

| ID | Risk | Previous Status | Updated Status |
|----|------|----------------|----------------|
| RF-10 | No CORS headers | Resolved | **Resolved** (unchanged) |
| RF-11 | No rate limiting | Accepted (deferred) | **Accepted (deferred)** -- cache service analytics will inform future rate limit thresholds |
| RF-12 | i18n retrofit pain | Active mitigation | **Active mitigation** -- i18n foundation in Phase 1, more urgent now with Brief #2 UI work |
| RF-13 | Content before i18n | Active mitigation | **Active mitigation** -- Phase 6 explicitly blocked by i18n completion |
| RF-14 | No Designer role | Open | **Resolved** -- Designer maps to Dev. Brief #2 confirms this aliasing. |

---

## 8. Decisions from Brief #1 -- Status Check

All Brief #1 decisions remain active and valid. Brief #2 does not contradict any of them.

| ID | Decision | Brief #2 Impact |
|----|----------|----------------|
| D014 | Hash-fragment URLs approved | **Unchanged.** Still the approach. Email sharing in Phase 6D depends on this. |
| D015 | Rate limiting deferred | **Unchanged.** Cache service analytics will eventually inform rate limit design. |
| D016 | CORS handled by framework | **Unchanged.** |
| D017 | i18n before content | **Reinforced.** Brief #2 adds more UI (transparency panel, admin modules, analytics dashboard) -- all must go through i18n. |
| D018 | Token URLs use query string | **Unchanged.** Token-in-URL is visible to server. Cache hash resolution happens server-side. |
| D019 | Separate S3 bucket for observability | **Evolved.** Observability data now goes through cache service, which sits on Memory-FS. The separation principle still applies: observability cache entries are in a separate namespace from transfer cache entries. |
| D020 | Five themes | **Unchanged.** |
| D021 | Text input approved | **Unchanged.** |
| D022 | Email sharing: copy-text + Gmail compose | **Unchanged.** |
| D023 | i18n starts with en + pt | **Unchanged.** |

### New Decisions for Historian (Brief #2)

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| D024 | Google Analytics removed, replaced by server-side analytics | Third-party tracking breaks zero-knowledge promise. Server-side truth is more accurate. No cookies = no consent overhead. |
| D025 | Cache service is the unified data backbone | Five capabilities (files, tokens, analytics, events, costs) converge on one storage/query pattern. Eliminates five separate storage models. |
| D026 | LETS (Load, Extract, Transform, Save) is the data processing pattern | Optimise for read. Save aggregations. Cascade from fine to coarse granularity. Never reprocess raw data. |
| D027 | Tokens are human-friendly with usage limits via cache hash | Foundation for commercial model. Community-branded tokens. Usage limits are prototype paid plans. |
| D028 | IFD is a merge gate, not a guideline | QA verifies. Conductor enforces. PRs that fail IFD do not merge. Non-negotiable per human stakeholder directive. |
| D029 | GA removal sequenced after server-side analytics minimum bar | Two essential questions must be answerable: "Is anyone using the site right now?" and "How many people used the site today?" |
| D030 | Local storage is optional, visible, and clearable | Transparency panel shows all stored data. Key caching is opt-in. Zero-local-storage mode explored. |
| D031 | AWS cost data captured from day one via cache service | Unit economics visibility. Cost per request, per transfer, per user. Feeds financial risk model. |
| D032 | Admin UI uses modular event-driven architecture first | Iterate on admin before user-facing. Dynamic module loading. Event-driven communication between modules. |
| D033 | Designer, Advocate, Ambassador, Sherpa, GRC map to existing roles | No role proliferation. Dev=Designer, Journalist=Advocate+Ambassador, QA=Sherpa, AppSec=GRC+DPO. |

---

## 11. For the Human Stakeholder

Brief #1 and Brief #2 are now a unified execution plan. The cache service is the central design decision -- it touches everything. The Architect's schema is the single gating item.

The GA removal is handled responsibly: we build the replacement first, verify it answers the essential questions, then remove GA. No gap in visibility.

IFD is enforced as a merge gate, not a suggestion. QA verifies, Conductor rejects non-compliant PRs.

The role aliasing (Designer->Dev, Advocate->Journalist, etc.) keeps the team lean while ensuring every task from the brief has a clear owner.

Biggest risk: Phase 0 delay cascades through everything. The Architect must deliver the cache service schema within 1-2 days. If this slips, I will escalate.

---

*Next Conductor document will be produced after Phase 0 (cache service schema) is complete, or if a blocker emerges.*
