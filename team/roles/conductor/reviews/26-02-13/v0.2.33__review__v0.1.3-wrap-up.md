## 1. Execution Status Update -- 7-Phase Plan vs. Reality

The Brief #2 response laid out a 7-phase plan spanning 12 estimated working days. This session compressed Phase 0 and Phase 1 into a single working session and partially delivered elements of Phases 3, 6, and 7. Here is the full accounting.

### Phase 0: Cache Service Architecture (GATING)

| Planned | Actual | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Architect delivers cache service schema | Architect delivered full schema in Brief #2 response: 4 schemas (A-D), cache ID + cache hash resolution, LETS pipeline, temporal storage, 8-step implementation sequence | **COMPLETE** |
| AppSec reviews cache hash security | AppSec approved SHA-256 + salt approach in Brief #2 response | **COMPLETE** |
| QA reviews testability of temporal storage | QA specified 16 cache service tests and IFD compliance checklist in Brief #2 response | **COMPLETE** |

**Assessment:** Phase 0 was delivered as design documents within the Brief #2 response cycle, not as a separate implementation phase. This is faster than the 1-2 day estimate. Gate G1 (cache service schema) is **CLEARED**. The design-level gate moved at the speed of review documents, not implementation.

### Phase 1: Brief #1 P1 Items (Hash-Fragment, Text, i18n, Tier 1 Logging)

| Item | Planned Estimate | Actual | Status |
|------|-----------------|--------|--------|
| Hash-fragment URLs | 2-3 hours | Shipped in v0.1.1 | **COMPLETE** |
| Text input mode | 4-6 hours | Shipped in v0.1.2 | **COMPLETE** |
| i18n foundation | 6-8 hours | Shipped in v0.1.3 with 4 languages and 80+ strings | **COMPLETE -- exceeded scope** |
| DevOps Tier 1 logging | Quick | Not confirmed as shipped | **UNKNOWN** |

**Assessment:** Phase 1 is effectively complete. Three out of four items shipped as production UI versions following IFD. The i18n delivery exceeded the plan -- the plan called for `en + pt`, but the session delivered `en + pt-BR + pt-PT + tlh` with event-driven re-rendering and a visual language selector. This is a pattern I want to highlight: the team over-delivered on the right item. i18n is the foundation for all future UI content, and proving it works with four languages (including a constructed language with a non-Latin script-name) validates the architecture far more than two languages would have.

Gate G4 (i18n foundation) is **CLEARED**.
Gate G7 (hash-fragment URLs) is **CLEARED**.

The only gap is DevOps Tier 1 logging. This needs confirmation in the next session.

### Phase 2: Cache Service Core Implementation (Days 2-5)

| Planned | Actual | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Dev implements cache service on Memory-FS | Not started | **NOT STARTED** |
| QA writes cache service unit tests | Test specifications written, not yet implemented | **NOT STARTED** |

**Assessment:** Phase 2 is unblocked (Phase 0 gate cleared) but was not reached in this session. This is the correct outcome -- the session prioritised shipping user-facing UI over backend infrastructure. Phase 2 is the top priority for the next session.

### Phase 3: Server-Side Analytics + GA Removal (Days 4-8)

| Item | Planned | Actual | Status |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| Wire event sources into cache service | After Phase 2 | Not started | **NOT STARTED** |
| LETS aggregation pipeline | After Phase 2 | Not started | **NOT STARTED** |
| Minimal analytics dashboard | After aggregation pipeline | Not started | **NOT STARTED** |
| GA removal | After dashboard answers 2 essential questions | **GA already removed in v0.1.1** | **DEVIATED -- see below** |

**Critical deviation: GA was removed ahead of the sequencing gate.**

The 7-phase plan explicitly stated: "The GA removal gate is explicit: GA stays until analytics answers the two essential questions. No exceptions." In practice, GA was removed in v0.1.1 as part of the hash-fragment URL work, before any server-side analytics existed.

**Why this happened:** The DPO and AppSec both issued P0 recommendations to remove GA (5 HIGH-severity risks of keeping, 0 HIGH of removing). The human stakeholder made the call. The unanimous team recommendation overrode the Conductor's sequencing gate.

**Was this the right call?** Yes. The sequencing gate was designed to prevent a visibility gap. But the risk calculus changed when the DPO analysis revealed that keeping GA actively harmed the zero-knowledge privacy posture. The compliance risk of keeping GA outweighed the operational risk of losing visibility. Additionally, the LinkedIn post featuring the product required a clean, cookie-free experience.

**Consequence:** We currently have **zero analytics**. No way to answer "Is anyone using the site?" or "How many people used the site today?" This makes the server-side analytics pipeline (Phase 3) more urgent, not less. It is now the primary operational risk.

Gate G3 (server-side analytics minimum bar) is **BYPASSED** -- GA removed without replacement. The gate still applies to declaring analytics "done", but the sequencing constraint is moot.

### Phase 4: Token System Enhancement (Days 5-9)

**NOT STARTED.** Blocked on Phase 2 (cache service core). Architecture delivered (cache hash resolution, human-friendly tokens, usage limits). Implementation waiting.

### Phase 5: AWS Cost Capture (Days 6-10)

**NOT STARTED.** Blocked on Phase 2 (cache service core). Architecture delivered (cost entry schema, collector pattern). Implementation waiting.

### Phase 6: UI Workstreams (Days 5-12)

| Track | Planned | Actual | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| Track A: Local Storage Transparency Panel | After i18n | Not started | **UNBLOCKED** (i18n shipped) |
| Track B: Modular Admin UI | After cache service | Not started | **BLOCKED** on Phase 2 |
| Track C: Landing Page Content | After i18n + Journalist copy | Journalist copy ready (70+ i18n keys from Brief #1) | **PARTIALLY READY** |
| Track D: Email Sharing | After hash-fragment URLs | Not started | **UNBLOCKED** (hash-fragment shipped) |
| Track E: Themes | After i18n | Not started | **UNBLOCKED** (i18n shipped) |

**Assessment:** Phase 1 completion unblocked three of five Phase 6 tracks (A, D, E). Track C has content ready from the Journalist but needs integration. Track B remains blocked on the cache service. This is a significant unlock -- the next session can deliver visible UI improvements in parallel with cache service work.

### Phase 7: Research + Formal Reviews (Ongoing)

| Item | Planned | Actual | Status |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| DPO formal GA removal analysis | Parallel | Delivered in Brief #2 response | **COMPLETE** |
| AppSec GA risk assessment | Parallel | Delivered in Brief #2 response | **COMPLETE** |
| Journalist zero-cookie positioning | Parallel | Delivered (competitive positioning, privacy policy drafts) | **COMPLETE** |
| Sherpa user journey analysis | Parallel | **Activated for first time** -- 3 foundational documents | **COMPLETE (initial)** |
| DPO local key caching review | Parallel | Delivered in Brief #2 response (7 conditions) | **COMPLETE** |
| Domain preference research | Parallel | Not started | **NOT STARTED** |

**Assessment:** Phase 7 delivered strongly. The Sherpa activation was unplanned but valuable -- 13 friction points mapped, 48 telemetry events designed, sender and recipient flows fully documented. This gives the team a user-experience baseline that did not exist before this session.

### Summary Scorecard

| Phase | Status | Completion |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Phase 0: Cache Service Architecture | **COMPLETE** | 100% |
| Phase 1: Brief #1 P1 Items | **COMPLETE** (pending Tier 1 logging confirmation) | ~95% |
| Phase 2: Cache Service Core | NOT STARTED (unblocked) | 0% |
| Phase 3: Server-Side Analytics | PARTIALLY DEVIATED (GA removed early) | 10% (GA removed, pipeline not built) |
| Phase 4: Token System Enhancement | NOT STARTED (blocked on Phase 2) | 0% |
| Phase 5: AWS Cost Capture | NOT STARTED (blocked on Phase 2) | 0% |
| Phase 6: UI Workstreams | 3 of 5 tracks UNBLOCKED | 10% (i18n foundation counts) |
| Phase 7: Research + Reviews | Strong progress | ~60% |

## 2. Velocity Analysis

### By the Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Daily briefs processed | 2 |
| Role responses produced | 22 (10 + 9 + 3 Sherpa) |
| UI versions shipped | 3 |
| Languages live | 4 |
| Bug fixes shipped | 7 |
| Decisions logged | 20 (D014-D033) |
| New lines of code | 4,573 across 22 files |
| Debriefs produced | 3 |

### What Worked Well

**1. Phase 1 compressed from "Days 1-3" to a single session.**
The 7-phase plan estimated 12-17 hours for Phase 1 items (hash-fragment 2-3h, text input 4-6h, i18n 6-8h). All three shipped in one session. This suggests the estimates were conservative, or the implementation velocity was exceptionally high, or both. The IFD methodology helped here -- each version was a clean, self-contained increment that did not require modifying previous work.

**2. IFD proved its value under pressure.**
Three UI versions shipped side by side. v0.1.0 remains untouched and accessible. Each version built on the previous one but did not modify it. Rollback to any version is instant. This is the IFD payoff: the team shipped fast because the risk of each increment was near zero.

**3. The review-then-implement cadence worked.**
Brief #1 produced 10 role reviews. Those reviews (especially Architect + AppSec approvals) unblocked implementation. The implementation then happened in the same session. The team did not wait for a separate "implementation session" -- the design cycle and the build cycle were adjacent, not separated by days.

**4. Role aliasing prevented thrash.**
The Brief #2 response mapped 6 new role references (Designer, Advocate, Ambassador, Sherpa, GRC, DPO) to existing roles. This kept the team lean. In practice, the DPO (mapped to AppSec) and Sherpa (mapped to QA) produced valuable, distinct outputs without requiring new role infrastructure. The aliasing pattern is validated.

**5. The Sherpa activation was high-value, low-cost.**
Three documents. 13 friction points. 48 telemetry events. Sender and recipient flows mapped. This was not planned in the 7-phase plan but added significant value. The friction log (F002: split-channel sharing) was already partially resolved by v0.1.1 hash-fragment URLs, demonstrating that the team is addressing real user pain points even before formalising them.

### Bottlenecks That Emerged

**1. Zero analytics after GA removal.**
This is the session's biggest operational gap. We shipped a product publicly on LinkedIn with no way to measure traffic. The next session must address this urgently. Even a minimal server-side pulse ("requests in the last hour") would be better than the current blind spot.

**2. Backend infrastructure work did not start.**
Phases 2-5 (cache service core, analytics pipeline, token system, cost capture) are all at 0%. The session correctly prioritised user-facing shipping, but the backend debt is now significant. The cache service is the gating item for 4 out of 7 phases.

**3. The plan-to-execution ratio was high.**
22 role responses is impressive throughput, but it also means the team spent significant time on planning and review documents. For the next session, the ratio should shift toward implementation. The architectural decisions are made. The schemas are designed. What is needed now is code.

**4. DevOps Tier 1 logging status is ambiguous.**
The plan listed this as "quick" and "already approved." The session debrief does not confirm it shipped. If CloudWatch/CloudFront logging is not yet enabled, we are running a public-facing service with no operational visibility at all (no GA, no server-side analytics, potentially no AWS logging). This must be resolved immediately.

### Optimisation Recommendations for the Next Session

| # | Recommendation | Rationale |
|---|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Start with implementation, not reviews.** | The architecture is decided. The schemas are designed. The next session should open with `git checkout` and code, not with role response documents. |
| 2 | **Split the session: backend morning, UI afternoon.** | Cache service core (Phase 2) and at least one Phase 6 UI track can run in parallel. This prevents the all-backend or all-frontend bottleneck. |
| 3 | **Cap role responses at 5 per brief.** | 22 role responses in one session is thorough but heavy. For the next session, limit to: Conductor (plan), Dev (implementation), QA (tests), and 1-2 others as needed. Let implementation speak louder than documents. |
| 4 | **Ship a "pulse" analytics endpoint before anything else.** | Even before the full LETS pipeline, a simple endpoint that counts requests in the last N minutes gives us the minimum viable visibility we lost when GA was removed. |
| 5 | **Confirm DevOps Tier 1 logging in the first 10 minutes.** | Binary question: are CloudWatch logs flowing? If no, enable them before any other work. |

## 3. LinkedIn Post as Workflow Signal

### The Post

Dinis Cruz posted publicly on LinkedIn featuring the v0.1.3 multilingual MVP with screenshots showing all 4 languages and the flag-based language selector. URL: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7428147910451638272/

### What This Signals

**1. The product is now publicly visible.**
Before this post, SGraph Send was a friendlies-only beta behind an access token. The LinkedIn post breaks that boundary. Anyone who sees the post can visit `send.sgraph.ai`. The access gate still requires a token for sending, but the download page and the UI are publicly browsable. This changes the threat model and the quality bar.

**2. The Klingon angle is a growth hack.**
The Klingon translation is memorable, shareable, and signals technical capability (the i18n architecture handles any language). This is not a gimmick -- it is a demonstration that the system is genuinely internationalised. The Klingon angle is likely to generate shares and comments that a "we support English and Portuguese" post would not.

**3. The "zero cookies" narrative is the follow-up.**
The LinkedIn post leads with the fun angle (Klingon). The next post should lead with the serious angle: zero cookies, zero tracking, zero knowledge. This is a competitive differentiator that no major file-sharing service can match. The Journalist and Ambassador should prepare this content.

### Does This Change Priorities?

**Yes, in two ways:**

**Priority shift 1: Stability and polish become more urgent.**
LinkedIn traffic is unpredictable. If the post gets traction, new visitors will hit `send.sgraph.ai` and see the v0.1.3 UI. The UI should look polished, explain itself, and handle edge cases gracefully. This elevates Phase 6 Track C (landing page content) and Track E (themes) from "nice to have" to "should ship soon."

**Priority shift 2: Analytics visibility is now a P0 operational need.**
We are flying blind. If the LinkedIn post drives traffic, we will not know. We cannot answer basic questions: How many people visited? Did anyone try to use the send function? Did anyone hit the access gate and leave? The server-side analytics pipeline (Phase 3) was already urgent; the LinkedIn post makes it critical.

### Should We Accelerate Any Workstreams?

| Workstream | Before LinkedIn | After LinkedIn | Rationale |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| Server-side analytics (Phase 3) | P1 (next after cache service) | **P0** (operational blind spot) | No visibility on public traffic |
| Landing page content (Phase 6C) | P2 (after i18n) | **P1** (first impression matters) | LinkedIn visitors see raw UI |
| Themes (Phase 6E) | P3 (polish) | **P2** (visual credibility) | Professional appearance for new visitors |
| Email sharing (Phase 6D) | P2 (after hash-fragment) | Unchanged P2 | Still important but not LinkedIn-driven |
| Cache service core (Phase 2) | P0 (gating item) | **P0** (unchanged -- still the gating item) | Nothing changes the fundamental dependency |

### Follow-Up Content Strategy

The Journalist and Ambassador should prepare:

1. **"Zero Cookies" LinkedIn post** -- the privacy story. Lead with "SGraph Send uses zero cookies, zero third-party tracking, zero knowledge of your files." This is the competitive positioning angle.
2. **Technical blog post** -- how the i18n system works. Target: developer audience on LinkedIn. Shows the IFD methodology in practice.
3. **Community engagement** -- respond to comments on the Klingon post. If anyone asks about other languages, the answer is "submit a PR" or "which language would you like?" This turns comments into engagement.

## 4. Updated Priority Stack -- Next Session

Given the 7-phase plan status, the LinkedIn post, and the operational gaps, the next session should focus on these priorities in order:

### Priority 1: Operational Visibility (URGENT)

**What:** Confirm DevOps Tier 1 logging. Ship a minimal analytics pulse. Answer: "Is anyone using the site?"

**Why:** We have a publicly-announced product with zero analytics. This is the single biggest operational risk. Every hour without visibility is an hour where we cannot detect problems, measure interest, or respond to issues.

**Scope:**
- Verify CloudWatch logs are flowing (5 minutes)
- Implement a minimal request counter in the Lambda handler that writes to Memory-FS (1-2 hours)
- Expose a `/admin/pulse` endpoint that returns request counts for the last hour/day (1 hour)
- This is NOT the full LETS pipeline. This is the emergency minimum while the cache service is being built.

**Owner:** DevOps (logging) + Dev (pulse endpoint)

### Priority 2: Cache Service Core (GATING -- enables Phases 3, 4, 5)

**What:** Implement the cache service on Memory-FS per the Architect's schema. Cache ID generation, cache hash resolution, temporal storage, basic LETS pipeline.

**Why:** Four phases (3, 4, 5, and 6B) are blocked on this. It is the single longest dependency chain in the project. Every day it does not ship delays four other phases.

**Scope:**
- Cache ID generation + file tree structure
- Cache hash derivation + resolution to cache ID
- Temporal storage (write to date path + latest simultaneously)
- LETS pipeline: at least raw event writing + 30-minute aggregation
- Unit tests: in-memory Memory-FS, no mocks

**Owner:** Dev (lead) + QA (tests)

### Priority 3: Landing Page Content (LinkedIn-driven)

**What:** Integrate the Journalist's existing landing page copy into v0.1.4 (or next IFD version). Explain what SGraph Send is, how it works, and why it is private. Use i18n keys for all content.

**Why:** LinkedIn visitors arrive at `send.sgraph.ai` and see a functional but unexplained UI. A landing page that communicates the value proposition converts visitors into users. The Journalist has already produced the copy (70+ i18n keys from Brief #1). This is integration work, not content creation.

**Scope:**
- New IFD version (v0.1.4) with landing page section
- Integrate Journalist's i18n keys
- Brief explanatory content: what it is, how encryption works, zero-knowledge promise
- Call to action: try it (with token) or join waitlist (LaunchList)

**Owner:** Dev (integration) + Journalist (copy review)

### Priority 4: Email Sharing (User-Requested)

**What:** Add copy-as-text and Gmail compose link to the download page. Use hash-fragment URLs (already shipped in v0.1.1).

**Why:** The Brief #1 identified sharing UX as a top priority. Hash-fragment URLs solved the split-channel problem. Email sharing is the natural next step. The Journalist has email template copy ready.

**Scope:**
- "Share via email" button on the post-upload success screen
- Copy-to-clipboard with pre-formatted text (URL + brief explanation)
- "Open in Gmail" link that pre-populates subject and body
- IFD versioned

**Owner:** Dev (implementation) + Journalist (template copy)

### Priority 5: Theme System (Visual Polish)

**What:** Implement CSS-variable-based themes. 5 variants: Dark, High Contrast, Aurora, Glacier, Ember.

**Why:** The current UI is functional but visually plain. Themes add personality and demonstrate the product's polish to LinkedIn-driven visitors. The CSS-variable approach means themes are non-destructive and IFD-compliant by design.

**Scope:**
- CSS variables for all colour values
- Theme switcher component
- 5 palettes defined
- IFD versioned

**Owner:** Dev

### Priority Stack Summary

```
P0  [1] Operational visibility (logging + pulse endpoint)
P0  [2] Cache service core implementation
P1  [3] Landing page content integration
P2  [4] Email sharing
P2  [5] Theme system
```

## 5. Risk Register Update (RF-15 through RF-22)

### Updated Status

| ID | Risk | Previous Status | Updated Status | Notes |
|----|------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| RF-15 | Cache service schema delay blocks all Brief #2 work | Active -- monitoring | **RESOLVED** | Architect delivered full schema in Brief #2 response. Gate G1 cleared. |
| RF-16 | Cache hash collisions in token resolution | Open -- pending Phase 0 | **OPEN -- pending Phase 2** | Architect specified SHA-256 + salt. AppSec approved. Collision handling defined. Risk is now in implementation, not design. Implementation must match spec. |
| RF-17 | GA removed before server-side analytics is ready | Mitigated by sequencing | **MATERIALISED -- accepted** | GA was removed in v0.1.1. The sequencing gate was bypassed by human stakeholder decision based on unanimous DPO/AppSec recommendation. The risk (visibility gap) has materialised. Mitigation: Priority 1 in next session is operational visibility. |
| RF-18 | LETS aggregation correctness (cascading errors) | Open -- pending Phase 2 | **OPEN -- pending Phase 2** | Unchanged. QA has test specifications ready. Risk activates when implementation begins. |
| RF-19 | Cache service becomes a performance bottleneck | Accepted -- monitor | **ACCEPTED -- monitor** | Unchanged. Cache service not yet implemented. Memory-FS baseline performance is proven. Monitor when implementation ships. |
| RF-20 | IFD compliance slows UI delivery | Accepted by design | **VALIDATED -- not a bottleneck** | Three IFD-compliant versions shipped in one session. IFD did not slow delivery. If anything, IFD enabled faster shipping by reducing risk per increment. Reclassify from "risk" to "validated practice." |
| RF-21 | Scope expansion: five cache service consumers in one sprint | Mitigated by sequencing | **MITIGATED -- sequencing holds** | Strict phasing (analytics first, then tokens, then costs) is still the plan. Phase 2 core must ship before any consumer. No change needed. |
| RF-22 | No CloudFront logs flowing yet | Active -- workaround available | **ACTIVE -- more urgent** | With GA removed, CloudFront logs are now the only potential source of access-level traffic data. DPO must sign off IP masking before enabling. Elevated to P0 operational concern (see Priority 1). |

### New Risks Identified This Session

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|----|------|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|
| RF-23 | **Zero analytics on a publicly-announced product** | Certain (current state) | High | Priority 1 in next session: pulse endpoint + Tier 1 logging. Cache service analytics (Phase 3) is the permanent fix. | **ACTIVE -- P0** |
| RF-24 | **LinkedIn traffic spike hits unpolished UI** | Medium | Medium | Landing page content (Priority 3) and themes (Priority 5) address first impressions. Access gate limits functional exposure. Current v0.1.3 UI is functional, just not explanatory. | **ACTIVE -- P1** |
| RF-25 | **Plan-to-execution ratio too high** | Medium | Low | Next session should be implementation-heavy. Cap role responses. Start with code, not documents. The architecture is decided. | **ACTIVE -- process adjustment** |

### Closed / Reclassified Risks

| ID | Risk | Previous Status | New Status | Reason |
|----|------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| RF-15 | Cache service schema delay | Active -- monitoring | **CLOSED** | Schema delivered. |
| RF-20 | IFD slows UI delivery | Accepted by design | **CLOSED (validated)** | Three versions shipped in one session. IFD is not a drag on velocity. |

---

## 6. Gate Status Summary

| Gate | Description | Status | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| G1 | Cache service schema | **CLEARED** | Architect delivered in Brief #2 response |
| G2 | Cache service implementation | **OPEN** | Phase 2 not started. Top priority for next session. |
| G3 | Server-side analytics minimum bar | **BYPASSED** | GA removed before analytics replacement. The gate's sequencing purpose is moot, but the capability requirement remains: we still need to answer the two essential questions. |
| G4 | i18n foundation | **CLEARED** | Shipped in v0.1.3 with 4 languages |
| G5 | IFD compliance | **STANDING** | Applied to all 3 UI versions this session. All passed. |
| G6 | IP masking configuration | **OPEN** | DPO sign-off needed before CloudFront log ingestion |
| G7 | Hash-fragment URLs | **CLEARED** | Shipped in v0.1.1 |

---

## 7. Conductor Directives for Next Session

1. **Open with operational visibility.** First 30 minutes: confirm logging, ship pulse endpoint. Non-negotiable.
2. **Cache service core is the main event.** This is the critical path. Dev should spend the majority of the session on Phase 2 implementation.
3. **Run one UI track in parallel.** Landing page content (Priority 3) does not depend on the cache service. Dev can integrate Journalist copy while cache service tests run.
4. **Limit planning overhead.** No more than 3 role responses per brief in the next session. The architecture is decided. Ship code.
5. **Sherpa friction log is the UX compass.** The 13 friction points (3 HIGH, 5 MEDIUM, 5 LOW) should guide UI work priority within Phase 6.
6. **Prepare the "zero cookies" LinkedIn post.** The Klingon post opens the door. The privacy story closes the sale. Journalist should draft this for Dinis to review.

---

## 8. Session Assessment

This session was **highly productive**. The team:
- Processed 2 daily briefs and produced 22 role responses
- Shipped 3 IFD-compliant UI versions (v0.1.1, v0.1.2, v0.1.3)
- Fixed 7 bugs
- Activated a new role (Sherpa) with valuable output
- Made and logged 20 decisions (D014-D033)
- Cleared 3 of 7 gates (G1, G4, G7)
- Generated the first public LinkedIn announcement of the product

The one deviation from the plan (GA removal ahead of the analytics gate) was the right call in context, but it created the session's biggest gap: zero operational visibility. The next session must close this gap before anything else.

The velocity pattern is clear: when the architecture is decided and the gates are cleared, implementation moves fast. Phase 1 items that were estimated at 12-17 hours shipped in one session. The lesson for the next session is to spend less time on planning and more time on building. The 7-phase plan is the map. Now we execute.

*Next Conductor document: after Priority 1 (operational visibility) and Priority 2 (cache service core) are delivered, or if a blocker emerges.*
