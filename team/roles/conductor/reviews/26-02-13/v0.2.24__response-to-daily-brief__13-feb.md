## 1. Brief Received — Milestone Acknowledged

First real user on the live MVP. Positive reaction. This validates the core product thesis. The brief correctly identifies the next priorities: simplify UX, build observability, lay architectural foundations.

---

## 2. Sequencing Plan

The brief assigns ~15 tasks across 10+ roles. Here's the dependency-aware execution order:

### Phase A: Gating Review (Day 1 — Immediate)

```
Architect + AppSec → Review hash-fragment approach
                     ↓ (APPROVED — both reviews complete)
                     Unblocks: Dev hash-in-URL implementation
```

**Status: COMPLETE.** Both Architect and AppSec have reviewed and approved the hash-fragment approach. Dev can proceed immediately.

### Phase B: P1 Implementation (Days 1-3)

```
                    ┌──────────────────────────────┐
                    │ Dev: Hash-fragment URLs (2-3h)│
                    └──────────┬───────────────────┘
                               │ unblocks
                    ┌──────────▼───────────────────┐
                    │ Dev: Email sharing (2-3h)     │
                    └──────────────────────────────┘

                    ┌──────────────────────────────┐
                    │ Dev: Text input (4-6h)        │ ← parallel track
                    └──────────────────────────────┘

                    ┌──────────────────────────────┐
                    │ DevOps: AWS observability      │ ← parallel track
                    │ settings brief (done above)   │
                    └──────────────────────────────┘
```

### Phase C: Architectural Foundations (Days 2-5)

**These must happen BEFORE Phase D content work:**

```
Architect: i18n design (done above)
         ↓
Dev: i18n module + string extraction (6-8h)
         ↓
Journalist + Designer: Author content through i18n layer
```

```
Designer: Theme palette definitions
         ↓
Dev: Theme manager + CSS variables (6-8h)
```

### Phase D: Content & UI (Days 3-7)

**Depends on i18n being in place:**

```
Journalist: Landing page copy (via i18n keys)
Designer: Landing page layout
Advocate: Review landing page for personas
         ↓
Dev: Integrate landing page content
```

```
Architect: Token schema (done above)
         ↓
Dev: Admin token UI (8-12h)
Sherpa: Review token onboarding trail
```

### Phase E: Observability Pipeline (Days 3-10)

```
DevOps: Enable AWS logging (Tier 1)
         ↓
DevOps + Dev: Build first collector
         ↓
Dev: Event data UI (2-3h)
DPO: Review event data exposure
```

### Phase F: Research & Review (Ongoing)

```
Advocate + Sherpa: Domain preference research (.ai vs .com)
Ambassador: Market positioning review
DPO: GA4 privacy audit, event data review
```

## 3. User Amendments Incorporated

### Rate Limiting → Deferred
Agreed. Rate limiting without traffic data is guesswork. Sequence: observability → visualisation → informed rate limits. Removed from Tier 0 priorities. DevOps confirms this in their review.

### CORS → Already Handled
`osbot-fast-api`'s `Serverless__Fast_API` includes CORS middleware. DevOps will verify headers in smoke tests but no build work needed.

## 4. Role Coordination Matrix

| Task | Lead | Support | Review |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| Hash-fragment implementation | Dev | — | AppSec (done) |
| Text input | Dev | — | QA |
| i18n foundation | Architect (design), Dev (impl) | Journalist (content) | — |
| Landing page | Journalist (copy), Designer (layout) | Advocate (review) | — |
| Admin token UI | Dev | Architect (schema) | Sherpa |
| AWS observability | DevOps | — | AppSec (S3 security) |
| Collector pipeline | Dev + DevOps | — | — |
| Event data UI | Dev | Designer | DPO |
| Theme system | Designer (palettes), Dev (impl) | — | QA, Advocate |
| Email sharing | Dev, Designer | Journalist (copy) | Ambassador |
| Domain research | Advocate | Sherpa, Ambassador | — |

## 5. Risk Register Update

| ID | Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|----|------|-----------|--------|
| RF-10 | No CORS headers | Handled by osbot-fast-api; DevOps to verify | **Resolved** |
| RF-11 | No rate limiting | Deferred per user directive — observability first | **Accepted (deferred)** |
| RF-12 | i18n retrofit pain | Starting i18n NOW before more content is added | Active mitigation |
| RF-13 | Content goes in before i18n is ready | Sequencing: i18n module before landing page content | Active mitigation |
| RF-14 | No Designer role (UI design by Dev) | Flagged — Dev can implement but needs palette definitions | Open |

---

## 6. Decisions for Historian

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| D014 | Hash-fragment approach approved for combined link+key URLs | Zero-knowledge maintained; UX dramatically simplified |
| D015 | Rate limiting deferred until observability pipeline provides traffic data | Cannot set meaningful thresholds without usage visibility |
| D016 | CORS confirmed handled by framework (osbot-fast-api) | No additional work needed |
| D017 | i18n must be in place before new UI content is authored | Prevents hardcoded string debt; content goes through translation layer |
| D018 | Token URLs use query string (not hash) — server visibility is the feature | Opposite of encryption key — we want backend to track token usage |
| D019 | Observability S3 bucket separate from transfer storage | Security boundary — per AppSec recommendation |

---

## Summary

The brief is well-structured. The gating review (hash-fragment) is already complete — both Architect and AppSec approve. The critical sequencing constraint is: **i18n must ship before the landing page content**. All other tracks can proceed in parallel.

Today's focus: Dev starts on hash-fragment URLs and text input. DevOps enables AWS logging. Architect's i18n design is ready for Dev to implement.
