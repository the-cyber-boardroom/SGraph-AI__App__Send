**version** v0.2.24
**date** 13 Feb 2026
**role** Conductor
**type** Achievement Brief + All-Roles Status Request

## Executive Summary

SGraph Send crossed from "working prototype" to "live product with users" today. The system is deployed, authenticated, analytics-instrumented, documented, and publicly announced on LinkedIn. This brief documents what was achieved, updates workstream status against the master roadmap, and requests all roles to review their current responsibilities and report back.

## Part 1: Achievements Since Last Conductor Brief (v0.2.16, 12 Feb)

### Session 1: Incident Handling Team Activation (13 Feb AM)

Five-phase incident handling series executed per Dinis Cruz's command brief:

| Phase | Deliverable | Status |
|-------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Reading guide for 5 incident documents | Done |
| 2 | Incident Response sections added to all 15 ROLE.md files | Done |
| 3 | Feature-9 in Issues FS with 15 tasks (d1000078–d1000092) | Done |
| 4 | Tabletop exercise: Total AWS Compromise scenario | Done |
| 5 | Journalist article: "Why We Treat Every Incident Like a Crisis" | Done |

### Session 2: MVP Auth + Launch Infrastructure (13 Feb PM)

| # | Achievement | Technical Detail |
|---|------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Per-route access token auth** | Replaced global `Middleware__Check_API_Key` (which blocked ALL routes) with surgical `check_access_token()` on create/upload/complete only. Download and info remain public. Env var: `SGRAPH_SEND__ACCESS_TOKEN`. |
| 2 | **Access gate web component** | `<send-access-gate>` — gates send page behind token input. Shows "Join Early Access" LaunchList form for unauthenticated visitors. Listens for 401 events to re-gate. |
| 3 | **LaunchList early access waitlist** | Embedded on send page (below access gate) and download page ("Want to send files too?"). LaunchList ID: `zSa8gI`. Form endpoint: `https://getlaunchlist.com/s/zSa8gI`. Admin dashboard: `https://getlaunchlist.com/sites/sgraph-send`. |
| 4 | **Root domain redirect** | `send.sgraph.ai` → `/send/v0/v0.1/v0.1.0/index.html` (307 redirect). Previously returned JSON "Not Found". |
| 5 | **Google Analytics** | GA property `G-GQTMWE0LHP` on both `send.sgraph.ai` and `docs.send.sgraph.ai`. Single analytics view across both domains. |
| 6 | **docs.send.sgraph.ai live** | Jekyll `url` configured to `https://docs.send.sgraph.ai`. Site deployed and working. |
| 7 | **Journalist launch article** | "SGraph Send Goes Live: Early Access Is Open" — covers auth, access gate, analytics, docs site. |
| 8 | **LinkedIn announcement** | Dinis Cruz posted publicly. First external visibility for SGraph Send. |

### Test Suite Status

- **56 tests passing** in ~2.4 seconds
- All tests use real implementations (in-memory backend), no mocks
- New tests cover: access token auth, root redirect, route registration

## Part 2: Workstream Status Update (Against Master Roadmap v0.2.16)

| WS ID | Workstream | Previous Status | Current Status | Notes |
|-------|-----------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| RF-1 | S3 Storage blocker | HIGH RISK | **RESOLVED** | S3 persistence live since 12 Feb. No longer blocking. |
| WS-2 | Google Analytics Integration | Wave 2 (days 5-12) | **DONE** | Shipped ahead of schedule. DPO review still recommended. |
| WS-7 | UI/Design Improvements | Wave 1 | **PARTIALLY DONE** | Access gate, LaunchList forms, root redirect done. Branding/design/SPA not started. |
| WS-12 | Journalist Website | Wave 0 | **DONE** | Jekyll site live at docs.send.sgraph.ai. 5 articles published. |
| WS-16 | Friendlies Outreach | Wave 3 (days 12-20) | **STARTED** | LaunchList waitlist live. LinkedIn post published. Token-based access working. |
| WS-1 | DPO Activation | Wave 1 | NOT STARTED | DPO ROLE.md created (incident section added), but no audit work done. |
| WS-3 | AWS Observability | Wave 1 | NOT STARTED | |
| WS-4 | Tabletop Exercise | Wave 4 | **DONE** (doc only) | Scenario documented. Live exercise not yet run. |
| WS-5 | Synthetic Users | Wave 3 | NOT STARTED | |
| WS-6 | Playwright Service | Wave 0 (design) | NOT STARTED | |
| WS-8 | User Research | Wave 1 | NOT STARTED | |
| WS-9 | Public Key Encryption | Wave 3 (design) | NOT STARTED | |
| WS-10 | Text Mode | Wave 0 | NOT STARTED | |
| WS-11 | Self-Hosted Scenarios | Wave 2 | NOT STARTED | |
| WS-13 | Sharing UX | Wave 1 | NOT STARTED | Still copy/paste only. |
| WS-14 | Foundation Architecture | Wave 1 | NOT STARTED | SPA routing, i18n, themes. |
| WS-15 | Code Quality | Wave 0 | NOT STARTED | |

### Key Observation

The friendlies release happened faster than the master roadmap predicted. We skipped ahead on WS-2, WS-12, and WS-16 by taking a pragmatic "good enough for friendlies" approach rather than completing all Wave 0/1 prerequisites. This was the right call — real users provide more signal than perfect infrastructure.

However, several foundational workstreams remain untouched (WS-1, WS-3, WS-13, WS-14). The question now is: **what do real users need next?**

## Part 3: Updated Risk Register

| # | Risk | Status | Action |
|---|------|--------|--------|
| RF-1 | S3 storage not ready | **CLOSED** — S3 live since 12 Feb | None |
| RF-2 | DPO IP audit reveals extensive logging | OPEN — no audit done yet | Needs prioritisation |
| RF-7 | No Designer role | OPEN — no Designer brief received | Continue with Dev-led UI |
| RF-8 | GA4 cookie behaviour | OPEN — GA deployed but DPO has not reviewed | DPO should review |
| RF-9 | **NEW** — Access token is a shared secret | LOW — acceptable for friendlies beta | Monitor; consider per-user tokens for public launch |
| RF-10 | **NEW** — No CORS headers configured | UNKNOWN — not tested cross-origin | AppSec/Dev should verify |
| RF-11 | **NEW** — No rate limiting on public endpoints | LOW for friendlies, HIGH for public launch | DevOps should plan |

---

## Part 4: What Dinis Cruz Wants Next

Based on the full brief history, the priorities after this milestone are:

1. **Sharing UX (WS-13)** — copy/paste is friction. The URL hash approach and email template are described in the daily brief.
2. **UI/Design polish (WS-7)** — the friendlies are seeing raw CSS. Branding, explanation pages, navigation.
3. **Foundation architecture (WS-14)** — SPA routing, URL navigation, multi-language, themes.
4. **Observability (WS-3)** — "maximum AWS observability" was explicitly requested.
5. **DPO audit (WS-1)** — GA is live without a privacy review. This should happen soon.

---

## Part 5: Request to All Roles

**All roles are requested to review their current tasks against this status update and report back to the Conductor.** Each role should produce a brief review document at:

```
team/roles/{role}/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.24__status-report__post-launch.md
```

### What each role should address:

| Role | Review Focus |
|------|-------------|
| **Architect** | What architecture decisions are needed next? SPA routing design? Sharing UX technical approach? Playwright service design? |
| **Dev** | What are the next implementation priorities? Sharing UX? SPA routing? Text mode? Code quality? |
| **QA** | What tests are missing for the live system? Auth edge cases? Sharing modes? Browser compatibility? |
| **DevOps** | What operational work is needed? Rate limiting? CORS? Observability dashboards? CI/CD improvements? |
| **AppSec** | Security review of: access token mechanism, GA privacy implications, URL hash fragment for sharing, CORS posture. |
| **DPO** | Priority: GA DPIA. IP address audit. Privacy wording for docs site. Cookie/localStorage review. |
| **Cartographer** | Update system landscape map: two live domains, GA, LaunchList, access token flow. |
| **Historian** | Log decisions made today: disable global middleware, per-route auth, GA property sharing, LaunchList selection, root redirect. |
| **Journalist** | Content plan for docs.send.sgraph.ai: what articles next? How-to guides? FAQ? |
| **Librarian** | Update master index with today's documents. Update Issues FS with completed tasks. |
| **Advocate** | Role not yet activated. Report: what's needed to activate? |
| **Sherpa** | Role not yet activated. Report: what's needed to activate? |
| **Ambassador** | Role not yet activated. Report: what's needed to activate? |

### Deadline

All role reports should be produced in the next session. The Conductor and Architect will then jointly produce the **next workstream plan** based on all inputs.

---

## Part 6: Proposed Next Session Agenda

1. **Collect all role status reports** (this document is the request)
2. **Conductor + Architect joint review** — map the next 2-3 priority workstreams
3. **Begin highest-priority workstream** — likely Sharing UX (WS-13) or Foundation Architecture (WS-14)
4. **DPO quick review of GA** — flag any issues before more traffic arrives

---

*This brief should be read by all roles. The Conductor coordinates; the Architect co-designs. Every role has a voice in what happens next.*
