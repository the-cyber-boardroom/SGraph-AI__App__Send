## 0. What Changed Since the 14 Feb Action Plan

The v0.3.2 action plan (14 Feb) was organised around four workstreams: Issues FS adoption, design agency brief, handover briefs for Villager, and research. That plan was forward-looking and relatively calm -- five roles, four waves, time-boxed sessions.

The v0.3.10 brief (15 Feb) changes the landscape significantly:

1. **The LETS pipeline shipped.** AWS logging is live, the first collector works end-to-end, and privacy-by-design was validated. This is no longer "plan it" -- it is "build on top of it."
2. **22 new tasks landed.** Seven are P1. Dev is carrying 20 of them. The Architect has 5, two of which are blocking.
3. **Server Analytics is now a major workstream.** It was a bullet point on 14 Feb; today it has its own dashboard design, four priority views, path-based routing, and the concept of a digital twin.
4. **UX bugs surfaced.** Six user-facing bugs and three admin-facing bugs need fixing. These are the kind of issues that erode trust with every user session -- they must ship fast.
5. **Upload/download resilience research was called out as strategically critical.** Large file transfer is the identified sweet spot. The research must start now, even though a separate detailed briefing is coming.

**Standing directive shift:** From "push the frontier, capture everything, prepare handovers" to **"fix what users hit, build the SA foundation, and start the resilience research -- in that order."**

The previous plan's workstreams (Issues FS, design agency, handovers, research) are not cancelled. They carry forward as background obligations. But the sprint focus is now dominated by the 22 tasks in the v0.3.10 brief.

---

## 1. Sprint Overview: Three Tracks

The brief explicitly defines three tracks. This plan adopts them:

### Track A: UX Bug Fixes (Ship Fast)

Fix everything that users and admins hit today. User-facing bugs first, admin-facing bugs second.

| # | Task | Priority | Owner | Type |
|---|------|----------|-------|------|
| 1 | Download page loading experience | P1 | Dev | Bug fix |
| 2 | Token expiry message | P1 | Dev | Bug fix |
| 3 | Token-aware page state | P1 | Dev | Bug fix |
| 5 | Upload progress bar granularity | P1 | Dev | Bug fix |
| 6 | Navigation guard during upload/download | P1 | Dev | Bug fix |
| 4 | Analytics Pulse on admin Lambda | P1 | Dev | Bug fix |
| 10 | Token fetch performance | P2 | Dev + Architect | Bug fix (blocked by Architect #9) |

**Goal:** Every P1 in this track ships within the first two waves. No user should encounter these bugs for more than one more session.

### Track B: Server Analytics Foundation

Build the SA dashboard infrastructure and the first operational view (cache browser). Everything else in SA depends on the cache browser.

| # | Task | Priority | Owner | Type |
|---|------|----------|-------|------|
| 17 | Path-based routing for SA dashboard | P2 | Dev + Architect | Infrastructure |
| 7 | Cache service browser UI | P1 | Dev + Architect | Build |
| 9 | Cache service usage mapping (token storage) | P2 | Architect | Architecture |
| 12 | Lambda functions dashboard | P2 | Dev | Build (after #7) |
| 13 | CloudFront log viewer | P2 | Dev | Build (after #7) |
| 11 | IFD version manifest + switcher | P2 | Dev + Architect | Build |
| 15 | S3-triggered Lambda for LETS | P2 | Dev + DevOps | Build |
| 16 | API call log, event log, message panel | P2 | Dev | Build (may need human code) |
| 18 | Admin UI navigation links | P2 | Dev | Build |
| 8 | End-to-end send workflow timings | P2 | Dev | Feature |
| 14 | Token usage counter | P2 | Dev + Designer | Feature |
| 21 | AWS infrastructure overview | P3 | Dev | Build (after #7) |
| 22 | Delta tracking for collected data | P3 | Dev | Build (after #15) |

**Goal:** Cache browser operational within Wave 3. SA dashboard routing live. Subsequent views fan out in Wave 4.

### Track C: Upload/Download Resilience Research

Non-blocking research that informs the large file transfer roadmap. Start early, deliver a landscape document.

| # | Task | Priority | Owner | Type |
|---|------|----------|-------|------|
| 19 | Upload/download resilience research | P2 | Architect + Dev | Research |
| 20 | Three-word key concept exploration | P3 | Architect + AppSec + Advocate | Research |

**Goal:** Research document delivered by Wave 4. Three-word key exploration is P3 and depends on AppSec review -- do not rush it.

---

## 2. Wave Sequencing

### Wave 1: Independent P1 Tasks (All User-Facing Bugs -- Parallel)

**Duration:** 1 session
**Constraint:** Zero dependencies. All can run in parallel. Dev is the sole owner.

| Task | Dev Action | Verification |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| #1 Download page loading | Show "Preparing your download..." immediately; defer mailing list prompt until after download UI renders | Loading state visible within first 100ms; mailing list only appears after download component ready |
| #2 Token expiry message | Intercept silent redirect; show clear error message with guidance ("Token expired", "Token used up", "Request a new token") | Expired/invalid/used token shows descriptive message, not blank page |
| #3 Token-aware page state | Check localStorage for valid token; if present, show "Send a file" link instead of "Join Early Access" prompt | Users with tokens see "Send a file"; users without see join prompt |
| #5 Upload progress granularity | Add progress events for: file selected, encryption start/progress/complete, upload start/progress/complete, server processing, link generation, done | Progress bar updates at every stage; no silent gaps longer than 2 seconds |
| #6 Navigation guard | Add `beforeunload` event during active transfers; intercept on-page link clicks with confirmation modal | Browser "are you sure?" dialog appears on tab close/navigation during transfer; on-page links show confirmation |

**Output:** Five bug fixes shipped. Every user-facing friction point addressed.

**Why these first:** The brief is explicit -- "every new user hits them." These are reputation-damaging bugs. Each one is independent. Ship them fast.

### Wave 2: Architect Unblocking Tasks + Admin P1 Bugs (Parallel Tracks)

**Duration:** 1 session
**Constraint:** Architect produces two blocking deliverables. Dev fixes the admin bug that has no dependencies.

**Architect track (parallel):**

| Task | Architect Action | Unblocks |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| #9 Cache service usage mapping | Produce architecture document: where are token cache entries, what is the lookup path, are there unnecessary reads, is S3 hit directly when cache should suffice? | Dev #10 (token fetch performance) |
| #17 Path-based routing design | Produce routing specification: URL structure, component mapping, SPA-style client-side routing approach, how to handle direct URL access | Dev #7 (cache browser), Dev #12-#13-#21 (all SA views) |
| #11 IFD version manifest spec | Define manifest format: list of available versions, active version, timestamps; define file location (root of major version) | Dev #11 (version switcher implementation) |

**Dev track (parallel with Architect):**

| Task | Dev Action | Verification |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| #4 Analytics Pulse fix | Investigate why Analytics Pulse is not functioning on admin Lambda; fix the data feed or rendering | Analytics Pulse shows real-time-ish activity data |
| #18 Admin UI navigation links | Add links to Swagger, main site, docs site | Links present and functional in admin UI |

**Output:** Three Architect specifications that unblock the entire SA dashboard track. Two admin fixes shipped.

**Why this sequencing:** The Architect is the critical path bottleneck. While the Architect produces specs, Dev fixes the admin bug and adds links -- tasks that require no Architect input. By the end of Wave 2, the Architect has cleared their two most important blocking items.

### Wave 3: SA Dashboard Build (Cache Browser First, Then Fan Out)

**Duration:** 1-2 sessions
**Constraint:** Depends on Wave 2 Architect deliverables. Dev is now fully focused on SA.

**Phase 3a: Foundation (sequential -- must complete before 3b)**

| Task | Owner | Action | Verification |
|------|-------|--------|--------------|
| #17 Path-based routing implementation | Dev + Architect | Implement client-side routing based on Architect spec; `/admin/dashboard/` base route; each view a self-contained component | Direct URL navigation works; no hash fragments |
| #7 Cache service browser | Dev + Architect | Build the cache browser view: browse cache IDs, navigate temporal data, view latest, inspect entries (JSON/text/binary), folder structure navigation | Cache browser operational at `/admin/dashboard/cache/`; can browse, inspect, navigate |

**Phase 3b: Parallel builds (after cache browser works)**

| Task | Owner | Action | Verification |
|------|-------|--------|--------------|
| #10 Token fetch performance fix | Dev + Architect | Apply fix identified by Architect cache mapping (#9) | Token list loads in < 1 second |
| #11 IFD version manifest + switcher | Dev | Implement manifest file at major version root; add version switcher to admin UI | Admin can switch between IFD minor versions |
| #16 API call log, event log, message panel | Dev | Add three missing UI elements to admin page (request code from human if not in existing guidance) | Three panels visible in admin UI; API calls logged; events logged; messages displayed |
| #8 End-to-end timing capture | Dev | Instrument send workflow with Performance API marks (client-side) and Lambda execution timing (server-side); store in cache service | Every send operation stores timing breakdown; visible in cache browser |
| #14 Token usage counter | Dev + Designer | Display token usage ("3 of 10 uses remaining") and token confirmation ("Token accepted: community-beta-2025") | Usage counter visible in upload flow UI |

**Output:** SA dashboard with working cache browser. Token performance fixed. Version switcher live. Timing data flowing. Three admin UI panels added.

**Why cache browser first:** The brief is explicit -- "the most important view because everything else depends on it." It is simultaneously a development tool (see what data we are collecting) and an operational dashboard. Building it first validates the routing infrastructure and the cache service integration pattern that all subsequent views reuse.

### Wave 4: P2 Features + Resilience Research (Parallel)

**Duration:** 1-2 sessions
**Constraint:** Some tasks depend on Wave 3 completion. Research can run anytime.

**SA Dashboard Views (after cache browser):**

| Task | Owner | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| #12 Lambda functions dashboard | Dev | List Lambda functions; show config, metrics, invocations, errors, duration; historical comparison |
| #13 CloudFront log viewer | Dev | Visualise CloudFront access logs; traffic patterns, request rates, response codes, popular endpoints |
| #15 S3-triggered Lambda for LETS | Dev + DevOps | Build the Lambda that fires on S3 log file arrival; extract, normalise, compress; save curated data to cache |

**Research (no dependencies -- can start anytime in Wave 4, or earlier if Dev capacity allows):**

| Task | Owner | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| #19 Upload/download resilience | Architect + Dev | Research document covering: current state, browser capabilities, S3 capabilities, existing solutions, encryption interaction, proposed architecture |
| #20 Three-word key exploration | Architect + AppSec + Advocate | AppSec: entropy analysis, brute-force surface, trademark check. Architect: technical feasibility. Advocate: UX improvement assessment |

**P3 items (stretch goals):**

| Task | Owner | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| #21 AWS infrastructure overview | Dev | Slim read-only console: CloudFront, Route 53, S3, Lambda -- all on one page |
| #22 Delta tracking | Dev | Compare collected data snapshots; save only changes; build temporal diff history |

**Output:** SA dashboard has three operational views. Resilience research document delivered. Three-word key has a go/no-go recommendation.

## 3. Role Coordination

### Critical Handoffs

| From | To | What | When | How to Verify |
|------|-----|------|------|---------------|
| **Architect** | **Dev** | Cache service usage mapping (#9) | End of Wave 2 | Document exists with clear bottleneck identification; Dev can implement fix without guessing |
| **Architect** | **Dev** | Path-based routing specification (#17) | End of Wave 2 | URL structure defined; component mapping clear; Dev can implement routing without design questions |
| **Architect** | **Dev** | IFD version manifest spec (#11) | End of Wave 2 | Manifest format defined; file location specified; Dev can implement without ambiguity |
| **Designer** | **Dev** | Token usage UI spec (#14) | Before Wave 3b | Mockup or description of counter placement, format, and conditional display |
| **DevOps** | **Dev** | S3 event trigger configuration (#15) | Before Wave 4 | S3 event notifications configured; Lambda trigger ready; IAM permissions in place |
| **AppSec** | **Architect** | Three-word key security review (#20) | During Wave 4 | Entropy analysis complete; go/no-go recommendation with conditions |
| **Human** | **Dev** | Three missing UI elements code (#16) | Before Wave 3b | Code shared or pointer to existing implementation provided |

### Communication Protocol

1. **Architect notifies Conductor** when each blocking deliverable is complete. Conductor immediately activates the dependent Dev tasks.
2. **Dev notifies Conductor** when each P1 bug fix ships. Conductor updates sprint tracking.
3. **AppSec notifies Architect and Conductor** when three-word key review is complete. Conductor decides whether to activate Dev work or defer.
4. **DevOps notifies Dev and Conductor** when S3 event trigger is configured. Dev can then build the LETS Lambda.
5. **Conductor escalates to Human** if any blocking dependency is not delivered within one wave of its target.

## 4. Resource Concerns

### The Dev Overload Problem

**Dev has 20 tasks.** This is the single biggest execution risk in the sprint.

**Mitigation strategy:**

1. **Ruthless prioritisation via waves.** Dev does not look at Wave 3 until Wave 1 ships. Dev does not look at Wave 4 until Wave 3's cache browser is operational. The wave structure prevents context-switching.

2. **P1 bugs are small.** Tasks #1, #2, #3, #5, #6 are individually scoped as 30-60 minute fixes. The `beforeunload` guard (#6) is described in the brief as "a one-liner." Token expiry message (#2) is a conditional redirect intercept. Download page loading (#1) is a CSS/JS load order fix. These should not consume a full session.

3. **P2 tasks have dependencies that naturally throttle.** Dev cannot start #10 until Architect delivers #9. Dev cannot start #7 until Architect delivers #17. Dev cannot start #15 until DevOps delivers the S3 config. This means not all 20 tasks can be active simultaneously -- the dependency graph gates them.

4. **P3 tasks are stretch goals.** If Dev does not reach #21 or #22 in this sprint, that is acceptable. They are explicitly labelled P3.

5. **Parallel execution within waves.** Within Wave 3b, tasks #10, #11, #16, #8, #14 are independent of each other. Dev can pick the most impactful or fastest-to-ship and work through them in any order.

**Realistic capacity estimate:** If each session can deliver 3-5 tasks, and we have 4 waves across approximately 4-5 sessions, Dev can handle 12-20 tasks. The P1s (7 tasks) and the SA foundation (cache browser + routing, 2 tasks) are the must-ship items. Everything else is best-effort.

### The Architect Bottleneck

**Architect has 5 tasks. Two are blocking.**

The Architect is the gatekeeper for the entire SA dashboard track (routing design) and the token performance fix (cache mapping). If the Architect is slow, everything downstream stalls.

**Mitigation strategy:**

1. **Wave 2 is the Architect's sprint.** Three specifications in one session. This is the Architect's highest-value work in the entire sprint. Clear the blocking items, then the Architect can shift to research (#19, #20) which is non-blocking.

2. **Time-box Architect specs.** The cache mapping (#9) should be a 1-2 hour investigation, not an exhaustive audit. The routing design (#17) can be a one-page specification. The manifest spec (#11) can be a half-page format definition. These are unblocking documents, not architecture treatises.

3. **Architect has existing documents to build on.** The Architect already produced the observability pipeline proposal (`v0.3.6__implementation-proposal__observability-pipeline.md`). The cache service architecture was reviewed on 13 Feb (`v0.2.40__review__cache-service-architecture-response.md`). These provide foundation -- the Architect is not starting from zero.

### Single-Task Roles

AppSec, Designer, and DevOps each have exactly one task. The risk is not overload but **context starvation** -- they may not have enough information to execute.

| Role | Task | Context Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------|-------------|------------|
| AppSec | Three-word key security review (#20) | Low -- well-defined scope (entropy analysis, trademark, go/no-go) | Existing threat model (`v0.2.15`) provides base. Brief gives clear questions. |
| Designer | Token usage UI spec (#14) | Medium -- needs to know the upload flow context, where the counter appears | Designer has the design agency brief context. Dev should provide a screenshot of current upload flow. |
| DevOps | S3 event trigger config (#15) | Low -- DevOps already configured all AWS logging. This is an extension of that work. | DevOps deployment checklist already exists (`v0.3.8`). |

## 5. Risk Register

### Active Risks (Carried Forward from v0.3.2)

| ID | Risk | Status | Impact on This Sprint |
|----|------|--------|-----------------------|
| RF-24 | LinkedIn traffic hits unpolished UI | ACTIVE | Wave 1 bug fixes directly address this -- polishing the user-facing experience |
| RF-29 | Admin UI API key in browser | ACTIVE | Not addressed in this sprint. Villager territory. |
| RF-32 | Over-engineering delays shipment | ACTIVE | Relevant to SA dashboard -- keep cache browser simple, ship first version fast |
| RF-33 | Architect bottleneck | ACTIVE | Directly addressed in this plan: Wave 2 is the Architect's sprint, time-boxed specs |
| RF-36 | Handover briefs insufficient for Villager | ACTIVE | Not addressed in this sprint (focus shifted to UX + SA). Handover work resumes after. |

### New Risks for This Sprint

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|----|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| RF-37 | **Dev overload -- 20 tasks cause context-switching and quality drops** | HIGH | High | Wave structure prevents parallelism overload. P1s are small. P3s are optional. Conductor enforces wave discipline. |
| RF-38 | **Architect specs delayed -- SA dashboard track stalls** | Medium | High | Time-box specs to 1-2 hours each. Architect has existing documents to build on. Conductor escalates if Wave 2 deliverables are not ready by end of session. |
| RF-39 | **Three missing UI elements (#16) blocked on human-provided code** | Medium | Medium | Explicit ask in recommendations (Section 6). Dev checks existing guidance first. If not found, request goes to human immediately -- do not wait. |
| RF-40 | **Cache browser scope creep** | Medium | Medium | The cache browser is a development tool first. Ship a minimal version: browse, inspect, navigate. Do not build search, filtering, or visualisation in V1. |
| RF-41 | **Upload progress events (#5) harder than expected** | Low-Medium | Medium | Some upload stages may not emit granular events natively. Dev may need to add synthetic progress for stages like "server processing." Accept approximation over perfection. |
| RF-42 | **Path-based routing conflicts with Lambda URL function routing** | Low | High | The SA dashboard is client-side SPA routing, not server-side routing. Verify that the Lambda URL function serves the same HTML for all `/admin/dashboard/*` paths. If not, this is an infrastructure change, not just a frontend change. |
| RF-43 | **Token-aware page state (#3) has edge cases** | Low | Low | What if the token in localStorage is expired but present? Dev needs to validate token freshness, not just existence. Include a server-side validation call or check expiry locally. |

### Risk Heat Map

```
                    IMPACT
                Low     Medium    High
            +--------+--------+--------+
   HIGH     |        | RF-37  |        |
Likelihood  +--------+--------+--------+
   MEDIUM   |        | RF-39  | RF-38  |
            |        | RF-40  |        |
            |        | RF-41  |        |
            +--------+--------+--------+
   LOW      | RF-43  |        | RF-42  |
            +--------+--------+--------+
```

**Top risk:** RF-37 (Dev overload). This is the one that can derail the sprint. The wave structure is the primary mitigation.

**Top blocking risk:** RF-38 (Architect delays). If the Architect does not deliver the routing spec and cache mapping by end of Wave 2, the entire SA track is frozen.

## 6. Recommendations for Human

### Decisions Needed

| # | Decision | Context | Options | Urgency |
|---|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| 1 | **Three missing UI elements code** | The brief says "I have working code in other projects" and "if not in current guidance, ask for them." The code is not in current guidance. | Share the implementation for API call log, event log, and message panel | **Before Wave 3b** -- Dev needs this to implement #16 |
| 2 | **Three-word key go/no-go** | AppSec will produce a security review. But the trade-off (usability vs. entropy) is ultimately a product decision, not a technical one. | After AppSec review: (a) Go with conditions, (b) No-go, (c) Defer | **Wave 4** -- not urgent, but the human should signal appetite so AppSec knows how deep to go |
| 3 | **Cache browser scope for V1** | The brief describes a full cache browser (browse IDs, temporal navigation, folder structure, JSON/text/binary inspection). Should V1 be minimal or comprehensive? | (a) Minimal: list + inspect, (b) Full: all described features, (c) Human picks the must-haves | **Before Wave 3** -- affects Dev scope estimation |
| 4 | **SA dashboard: which Lambda URL function serves it?** | Path-based routing at `/admin/dashboard/*` may require the admin Lambda to serve the dashboard HTML for all sub-paths. Is the dashboard part of the admin Lambda, or a separate deployment? | (a) Part of admin Lambda, (b) Separate Lambda, (c) Same Lambda, new route handler | **Before Wave 3** -- affects Architect routing design |
| 5 | **Upload/download resilience: separate briefing timeline** | The brief says "a separate detailed briefing is coming." When? If soon, the Architect can wait for it before starting research. If not soon, the Architect should start from the brief's own research questions. | (a) Briefing coming within 1-2 days -- Architect waits, (b) Briefing timing uncertain -- Architect starts now | **Before Wave 4** -- affects research scheduling |

### Items NOT Requiring Decisions (Informational)

- **Privacy-by-design validation is confirmed.** The DPO role's presence ensured no IP addresses in AWS logging. This is a success story for the role model. No action needed -- just recognition.
- **Trademark check on "What Three Words."** AppSec will check. If trademarked, we rebrand the concept. This does not need human input unless AppSec finds a problem.
- **The 14 Feb action plan items carry forward.** Issues FS adoption, design agency brief, handover briefs -- these are not cancelled. They run as background obligations alongside the v0.3.10 sprint. If the human wants to reprioritise (e.g., design agency brief is more urgent than SA dashboard), signal in the next brief.

---

## 7. Carried Forward from v0.3.2 Action Plan

The v0.3.2 plan had four workstreams. Here is their status relative to this sprint:

| Workstream | 14 Feb Status | 15 Feb Status | Action |
|------------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| **Issues FS adoption** | P1 -- create 6 `.issues` files | Not addressed in v0.3.10 brief | Carry forward. Conductor creates files when capacity allows. Not blocking anything in this sprint. |
| **Design agency brief** | P1 -- time-sensitive | Designer delivered brief and kickoff presentation (documents exist in `26-02-15/`) | **Largely complete.** Review documents. If human approves, this workstream closes. |
| **Handover briefs for Villager** | P1 -- critical path | Not addressed in v0.3.10 brief | Carry forward. Architect writes handovers after Wave 2 specs are delivered. Lower priority than SA dashboard. |
| **Research (large files, bots)** | P2 | Upload/download resilience research elevated in v0.3.10 brief as #19 | **Absorbed into Track C.** Bot research remains deferred. |

### Decisions from 14 Feb Still Pending

| Decision | Status |
|----------|--------|
| AD-1: Environment separation (Villager) | Still pending human input. Not blocking Explorer. |
| AD-3: Branching strategy (two teams) | Still pending human input. Not blocking Explorer. |
| AD-2: Handover brief format | Adopted. First handovers not yet written. |

---

## 9. Summary

This sprint has a clear shape: **fix, build, research.**

1. **Fix** -- Wave 1 clears all user-facing bugs. Wave 2 clears admin bugs and unblocks the Architect. Total: 7 P1 fixes shipped.

2. **Build** -- Wave 3 constructs the SA dashboard foundation: routing + cache browser + parallel feature work. This is the highest-investment phase and the one most likely to encounter scope creep. The Conductor must enforce "ship V1, iterate later."

3. **Research** -- Wave 4 delivers the resilience research document and explores three-word keys. This is strategic investment that does not ship to users but shapes the next quarter.

**The critical path runs through the Architect.** Waves 2 and 3 depend on the Architect delivering three specifications on time. If the Architect delivers, Dev can execute. If the Architect is late, everything downstream stalls.

**The biggest risk is Dev overload.** 20 tasks is too many for a sprint. The wave structure, dependency gating, and P3 deprioritisation are the mitigations. The Conductor's job is to enforce wave discipline and prevent Dev from working on Wave 3 items before Wave 1 ships.

**Three decisions need human input before Wave 3:** the three missing UI elements code, the SA dashboard hosting question (which Lambda), and the cache browser V1 scope.

Let's execute.
