# v0.4.16 -- GRC Debrief: INC-004 Documentation Token Leak — Complete

**Version:** v0.4.16
**Date:** 19 February 2026
**Role:** GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance)
**Team:** Explorer
**Incident:** INC-004
**Status:** CLOSED

---

## 1. Executive Summary

INC-004 is closed. A documentation pipeline leak exposed a real user's transfer ID and decryption key for approximately 30 minutes. The encrypted file was permanently deleted from S3 before any unauthorised access occurred. The affected user classified the data as Level 1 — Public. No ICO notification is required. The access token remains deliberately active (20 uses remaining) as a controlled experiment under formal risk acceptance (D080).

**Total elapsed time from incident to closure:** ~3 hours (15:50 to ~17:15)
**User data compromised:** None
**Regulatory action required:** None

## 2. What Happened

### The Incident

At ~15:45 on 19 February 2026, three AI agents (Historian, Journalist, Librarian) committed documentation files containing real credential values from the INC-003 fix:
- The `linkedin-user` access token
- Transfer ID `16bff884b7da`
- The decryption key for that transfer

These were pushed to a GitHub branch at ~15:50. The transfer ID + decryption key combination is the full data access path — anyone with both values could download and decrypt the file.

### The Response

| Phase | Time | Duration | Actions |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| Discovery | ~16:00 | — | Human spotted token in Journalist article |
| Round 1 redaction | ~16:04 | 4 min | Access tokens removed from 6 files |
| Round 2 redaction | ~16:12 | 8 min | Transfer IDs and decryption keys removed from 3 files |
| Escalation | ~16:15 | — | Reclassified from P4-as-P1 to P2-as-P1 (data breach) |
| S3 deletion | ~16:20-16:28 | 8 min | Encrypted file permanently deleted; download URL returns 404 |
| Recipient notification | ~16:28 | — | New SG/Send link created and sent |
| Breach notification docs | ~16:30-16:40 | 10 min | Notification process, user notification, ICO assessment created |
| Risk acceptance | ~16:36 | — | Deliberate decision to leave token active; GRC/DPO/Sherpa assess |
| Regulatory closure | ~17:00-17:15 | 15 min | Voice interview; Level 1 Public; no ICO notification |

### The Outcome

The zero-knowledge architecture provided the critical protection. Deleting the S3 object (the ciphertext) made the decryption key permanently useless. No data was accessed during the 30-minute exposure window (download count: 1, believed to be the user's own).

## 3. Governance Assessment

### What Worked

| Capability | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| **Detection speed** | Excellent — human spotted the leak within 10 minutes of push |
| **Response coordination** | Excellent — 10 roles mobilised within the hour |
| **Containment effectiveness** | Excellent — S3 deletion is a permanent, irreversible remedy |
| **Regulatory readiness** | Good — breach notification process, ICO assessment, and user notification created from scratch in ~30 minutes |
| **Risk-based decision making** | Excellent — deliberate token exposure assessed by three roles before proceeding |
| **Documentation** | Excellent — 15+ documents produced, all cross-referenced |

### What Failed

| Gap | Impact | Remediation |
|-----|--------|------------|
| **No credential scanning in documentation pipeline** | Agents committed real values without detection | Pre-commit hook for credential patterns (planned) |
| **No `[REDACTED]` convention existed** | Agents used real values because no convention told them not to | Convention now established (D076) |
| **Agents could not detect own mistakes** | The same agents that created INC-003 documentation created INC-004 | Self-review step needed before documentation commits |
| **No automated git history scanning** | Leaked values persist in git history indefinitely | Git history audit tooling (Q017) |

### Risk Register Update

| Risk ID | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| R001 (token quota) | 20 remaining uses of `linkedin-user` token | **Accepted** (D080) — monitoring active |
| R002 (metadata exposure) | Transfer metadata accessible via token | **Accepted** — low value, beta platform |
| R003 (reputational) | Deliberate exposure perceived as careless | **Accepted** — documentation trail demonstrates governance |
| R004 (malicious upload) | Token used for malicious content | **Accepted** — 20-use hard limit |
| R005 (INC-004 interaction) | Complicates ICO assessment | **Closed** — no ICO notification required |

## 4. Compliance Status

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| UK GDPR Art. 33 (breach notification to ICO) | **Not required** | Level 1 — Public data; low harm potential; single data subject (self) |
| UK GDPR Art. 34 (notification to data subject) | **Complete** | User breach notification created and delivered; user responded via voice interview |
| UK GDPR Art. 5(1)(f) (integrity and confidentiality) | **Compliant** | Breach contained within 28 minutes; S3 deletion permanent; no evidence of unauthorised access |
| Internal incident process | **Complete** | Full incident record, timeline, decisions, patterns documented |
| Data breach register | **Complete** | INC-004 recorded in Historian incident record and attribution leaderboard |

## 5. Decisions Produced

| Decision | Description | Made By |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| D074 | Real values must NEVER appear in documentation — `[REDACTED]` is the default | Dinis Cruz |
| D075 | Token rotation for `linkedin-user` (deferred — deliberate exposure) | Dinis Cruz |
| D076 | Credential scanning pre-commit hook to be implemented | Dinis Cruz |
| D077 | Transfer IDs are secrets (they enable the first half of the data access path) | Dinis Cruz |
| D078 | Data breach notification process established | Dinis Cruz |
| D079 | S3 deletion accepted as retroactive remedy for zero-knowledge breach | Dinis Cruz |
| D080 | Deliberate token exposure accepted for controlled experiment | Dinis Cruz |
| D081 | DPO clearance for immediate action | DPO |
| D082 | DPIA mandatory before any public token sharing programme | DPO |

## 6. Open Items

| Item | Owner | Priority | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| Pre-commit hook for credential scanning | Dev/DevOps | P2 | Not started |
| Git history audit for leaked values | DevOps | P3 | Not started |
| Token usage monitoring for `linkedin-user` | AppSec | P3 | Manual monitoring |
| `[REDACTED]` convention enforcement in agent prompts | Conductor | P2 | Convention established, enforcement pending |
| Token rotation decision (after experiment concludes) | Human | P4 | Deferred |

## 7. Lessons for Future Incidents

1. **The documentation pipeline is a publication pipeline.** Treat every commit as if it will be public. Use `[REDACTED]` from the first draft, not as a post-hoc correction.

2. **Zero-knowledge architecture provides a unique remediation path.** In a traditional system, deleting the server copy doesn't help if the data was in transit. In a zero-knowledge system, deleting the ciphertext makes the key worthless. This is a structural advantage.

3. **Voice interviews accelerate regulatory workflows.** The content sensitivity questionnaire took ~5 minutes via voice vs an estimated 20-30 minutes of typing. This should be standard for any questionnaire-based regulatory process.

4. **Risk acceptance is a valid response.** Not every exposure requires remediation. The deliberate token exposure decision (D080) demonstrates that informed risk acceptance — with documented assessment, conditions, and monitoring — is a governance capability, not a governance failure.

5. **Every incident is practice.** INC-004 built 8+ new capabilities that didn't exist before: breach notification process, ICO assessment framework, voice interview workflow, risk acceptance framework. The digital immune system is materially stronger.
