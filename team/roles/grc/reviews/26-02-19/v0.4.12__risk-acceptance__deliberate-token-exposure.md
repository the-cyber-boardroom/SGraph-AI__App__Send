# v0.4.12 -- GRC Risk Acceptance: Deliberate Token Exposure via Published Documentation

**Version:** v0.4.12
**Date:** 19 February 2026
**Role:** GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance)
**Team:** Explorer
**Triggered by:** Data Controller decision to push INC-003 article (containing `linkedin-user` access token) to `dev` branch
**Related:** [INC-003 record](../../historian/reviews/26-02-19/v0.4.12__incident-record__INC-003__access-token-leak-hotfix.md), [INC-004 record](../../historian/reviews/26-02-19/v0.4.12__incident-record__INC-004__documentation-token-leak.md)

---

## 1. Purpose

This document provides a formal risk assessment for the Data Controller to review and accept before deliberately increasing the exposure of an already-compromised access token (`linkedin-user`) by pushing the INC-003 article to the `dev` branch.

This action serves two purposes:
1. **Immediate:** Observe whether anyone discovers and uses the exposed token (a controlled honeypot experiment)
2. **Strategic:** Preview a future gamification/advocacy model where access tokens are shared publicly to drive user adoption

---

## 2. What Is Being Accepted

### The Immediate Action

Push the Journalist's INC-003 article to the `dev` branch. This article contains the `linkedin-user` access token value (already present in git history on the feature branch). Pushing to `dev` increases the audience from feature-branch collaborators to all repository contributors.

### Current State of the Token

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Token name | `linkedin-user` |
| Token status | **Active** (not rotated) |
| Usage | 30 of 50 uses consumed |
| Remaining uses | **20** |
| Already exposed in | Git history on branch `claude/read-explorer-guidance-StQko` (since ~15:50) |
| Redacted in HEAD | Yes — replaced with `[REDACTED]` in current file versions |
| In git history | **Still present** — readable by anyone who inspects commit diffs |

### What the Token Grants

| Capability | Risk Level | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|
| Upload files to SGraph Send | Low | Consumes sender quota only |
| Validate token (prove identity) | Low | No data access |
| View sender's transfer list | Medium | Reveals transfer metadata (IDs, timestamps, sizes) — but NOT file content |
| Download files | **None** | Downloads are anonymous; the token is not needed |
| Decrypt files | **None** | Decryption keys are client-side; the token has no relationship to keys |

### What the Token Does NOT Grant

- **No access to file content.** The zero-knowledge model means the server stores only ciphertext. The token is an authentication credential, not a decryption key.
- **No access to other users' data.** Tokens are scoped to a single sender identity.
- **No admin access.** Admin functions require a separate authentication path.

---

## 3. Risk Register

### R001: Token Quota Exhaustion

| Element | Assessment |
|---------|------------|
| **Risk** | Unauthorised parties use the remaining 20 token uses, consuming the sender's upload quota |
| **Likelihood** | Low-Medium (requires someone to find and use the token) |
| **Impact** | Low (20 uploads at the platform's size limits; no financial cost in beta) |
| **Mitigation** | Token auto-expires at 50 uses; only 20 remaining |
| **Residual risk** | Acceptable |

### R002: Transfer Metadata Exposure

| Element | Assessment |
|---------|------------|
| **Risk** | Someone uses the token to call the sender API and enumerate transfer metadata (IDs, timestamps, sizes) |
| **Likelihood** | Low (requires API knowledge beyond what the article provides) |
| **Impact** | Low-Medium (metadata only; no file content accessible; transfer IDs alone cannot access files without decryption keys) |
| **Mitigation** | Transfer `16bff884b7da` already deleted from S3; other transfers' decryption keys are not exposed |
| **Residual risk** | Acceptable |

### R003: Reputational Risk from Intentional Exposure

| Element | Assessment |
|---------|------------|
| **Risk** | If the deliberate nature of this exposure becomes known, it could be perceived as careless security practice rather than a controlled experiment |
| **Mitigation** | This risk acceptance document exists as evidence of deliberate, assessed decision-making |
| **Residual risk** | Acceptable — the documentation trail demonstrates governance |

### R004: Token Used to Upload Malicious Content

| Element | Assessment |
|---------|------------|
| **Risk** | An unauthorised party uses the token to upload malicious or illegal content, attributable to the `linkedin-user` sender identity |
| **Likelihood** | Very low (requires discovery, API understanding, and malicious intent) |
| **Impact** | Medium (content stored as encrypted ciphertext; server cannot inspect it; but the upload is attributed to `linkedin-user`) |
| **Mitigation** | 20-use hard limit; beta platform with minimal traffic; no automated content scanning exists (by design — zero-knowledge) |
| **Residual risk** | Acceptable given the 20-use limit and beta context |

### R005: Interaction with INC-004 (Data Breach)

| Element | Assessment |
|---------|------------|
| **Risk** | Pushing to `dev` re-exposes values already involved in INC-004. Could complicate the ICO assessment if the exposure is seen as voluntary rather than accidental |
| **Likelihood** | Low (the decryption key is disabled — S3 object deleted — so no user data is accessible) |
| **Impact** | Low (the token enables platform access, not data access; the data breach vector is already closed) |
| **Mitigation** | The S3 object for `16bff884b7da` is permanently deleted. The decryption key is useless. Only the access token (which grants platform access, not data access) is being deliberately exposed. The ICO assessment is about data exposure (INC-004), not credential exposure (INC-003). |
| **Residual risk** | Acceptable — clearly distinct from the INC-004 data breach |

## 4. Risk Matrix Summary

| Risk ID | Description | Likelihood | Impact | Residual Risk |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------|---------------|
| R001 | Quota exhaustion (20 uses) | Low-Medium | Low | **Accept** |
| R002 | Transfer metadata exposure | Low | Low-Medium | **Accept** |
| R003 | Reputational (intentional exposure) | Low | Medium | **Accept** |
| R004 | Malicious content upload | Very Low | Medium | **Accept** |
| R005 | INC-004 interaction | Low | Low | **Accept** |

**Overall risk level: LOW — acceptable with documented acceptance.**

---

## 5. Conditions for Acceptance

The GRC recommends acceptance of these risks **subject to the following conditions:**

| # | Condition | Rationale |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | **The S3 object for `16bff884b7da` remains deleted** | Ensures the decryption key (also in git history) cannot be used to access user data |
| 2 | **The token is NOT rotated before pushing to `dev`** (deliberate) | The experiment requires the token to remain active |
| 3 | **The token's 50-use hard limit is not increased** | Natural expiration limits blast radius |
| 4 | **Monitor token usage** after the push | If usage spikes, someone found and is using the token |
| 5 | **Document this as a deliberate decision, not an oversight** | This document serves that purpose |
| 6 | **The future gamification strategy (Section 6) must NOT proceed until threat detection infrastructure is operational** | The current experiment is low-risk due to beta scale; public sharing requires detection and isolation |

---

## 6. Future Strategy: Token Sharing for Gamification/Advocacy

The Data Controller has described a future strategy where access tokens are deliberately shared publicly (WhatsApp groups, LinkedIn, advocacy programmes) to drive user adoption. This is a fundamentally different risk profile from the current action.

### Current Action vs Future Strategy

| Dimension | Current (push to `dev`) | Future (public sharing) |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Audience | Repository contributors (private) | Public internet |
| Token volume | 1 token, 20 uses remaining | Many tokens, potentially unlimited uses |
| Discovery method | Must inspect git history or article | Actively promoted to target audiences |
| Threat detection | None | **Required — must be operational** |
| Deployment isolation | Single deployment | **Required — isolated from production users** |
| Monitoring | Manual (check usage count) | **Required — automated real-time monitoring** |

### GRC Prerequisites for Future Token Sharing Strategy

The future gamification strategy **MUST NOT proceed** until:

| # | Prerequisite | Why |
|---|-------------|-----|
| 1 | **Real-time traffic monitoring and alerting** | Must detect abnormal usage patterns (bulk uploads, rapid token cycling) |
| 2 | **Threat detection and automated response** | Must be able to revoke tokens automatically on abuse detection |
| 3 | **Deployment isolation** | Shared tokens must operate on a separate deployment from paying/production users to prevent abuse impacting real customers |
| 4 | **Rate limiting per token** | Beyond use-count limits, need per-minute/per-hour rate caps |
| 5 | **Formal risk acceptance for public sharing** | A separate, more comprehensive risk assessment covering public exposure |
| 6 | **Legal review of gamification rewards** | If rewards are offered for sharing, need compliance review (anti-spam, financial regulations for rewards) |
| 7 | **Abuse response playbook** | Documented process for handling token abuse, including communication templates for shared-token users |
