# GRC Review: Part-3 Briefs — Risk Assessment

**version** v0.5.13
**date** 21 Feb 2026
**role** GRC
**type** Review — governance, risk, and compliance assessment

## Briefs Assigned to GRC

| Brief | Risk Domain |
|-------|-------------|
| `dev-brief__fastapi-ec2-management-routes` | Operational risk — EC2 management via API. Admin compromise. Cost control. |
| `brief__ssh-key-utility-and-marketing-campaign` | Reputational risk — anonymous access, key generation liability. |

## FastAPI EC2 Routes — Risk Register

| Risk ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Residual Risk |
|---------|------|-----------|--------|------------|---------------|
| R-EC2-01 | Admin key compromise leads to unauthorized instance creation | Medium | High (cost, compute) | Budget controls, instance count cap, audit logging, alert on creation | Bounded by budget caps |
| R-EC2-02 | Runaway cost from uncontrolled instance creation | Medium | High (financial) | Daily spend cap ($10 default), max instance count (5 default), auto-terminate idle | Caps limit maximum exposure |
| R-EC2-03 | SSH exec used for lateral movement | Low | Medium | Zero egress on instances, encrypted content unreadable by admin | Admin has shell access but no data access — strong property |
| R-EC2-04 | Privilege escalation via IAM role on EC2 | Low | High | Instances created with no IAM role, no AWS API access | Enforced at creation time |

**Accepted risk**: the brief explicitly asks GRC to document this as accepted for the current phase. The EC2 routes are admin-only, budget-controlled, and audit-logged.

**Recommendation**: every new feature added to these routes requires GRC + AppSec assessment before implementation.

## SSH Key Utility — Risk Register

| Risk ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Residual Risk |
|---------|------|-----------|--------|------------|---------------|
| R-SSH-01 | Reputational risk — keys generated for malicious use | Low | Low | Static page, no tracking, no attribution. Same risk as any key generator. | Minimal — we don't know who generates or what for |
| R-SSH-02 | DDoS on the utility page | Low | Low | Static page, no server computation. CDN rate limiting sufficient. | Standard CDN protection |
| R-SSH-03 | Compromised page serves weak keys | Low | High | SRI hashes, SW trust model (v0.4.12), code review | Strong if integrity checks are in place |
| R-SSH-04 | Data collection liability | N/A | N/A | Zero data collection posture. No analytics, no cookies. | Confirm and document this explicitly. |

**Priority classification from brief**: B3/P7/D3 — low priority across all axes.

## Ongoing GRC Obligations

For all new briefs:
1. Any feature that exposes infrastructure management via API needs risk assessment
2. Any feature that serves anonymous users needs data collection posture confirmation
3. Budget controls on all cost-generating operations (EC2, LLM calls, S3) must be documented
