# Librarian Briefing — Issues-FS Handover + Issue Status Update

**From:** Conductor (on behalf of Dinis Cruz)
**To:** Librarian
**Date:** 12/02/2026
**Version:** v0.2.15
**Source:** `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/12/v0.2.10__review-of-user-site-mvp.md`

---

## Context

The MVP is working and Dinis has two sets of requests for the Librarian:

1. **Update existing Issues-FS** — review all issues and mark completed work
2. **Hand over Issues-FS user stories** to the Issues-FS team

---

## Tasks

### TASK-1: Review and Update All Issues in `.issues/`

**Priority:** High

The project has 50 issues in `.issues/` (1 project, 5 phases, 8 features, 36 tasks). All tasks are currently in `backlog` status, but "quite a good number" have been done.

Current state:
- Phase-1 (MVP): `in-progress` with 8 features, all in `backlog`
- Phase-2 through Phase-5: `deferred`

Work that has been completed (update these):
- FastAPI infrastructure (admin + user Lambdas)
- Transfer API endpoints (create, upload, complete, info, download)
- User UI (upload page, download page, Web Components)
- Schemas (Type_Safe data classes)
- Transfer service (in-memory)
- CI pipeline with automatic Lambda deployment
- Unit tests (44 passing)
- Integration smoke tests (11 passing)

Review each feature and task under Phase-1 and update statuses:
- `done` — for completed work
- `in-progress` — for partially done work
- `backlog` — for work not yet started

### TASK-2: Issues-FS User Stories Handover

**Priority:** Medium

The following user stories need to be handed over to the Issues-FS team. Create a handover document and/or issues tracking these:

1. **"As a user I should be able to get a quick overview of all issues using a command like: issues-fs stats"**
   - Current `issues-fs list` outputs a full list which becomes hard to consume with many issues
   - Need a summary/stats view (counts by status, by type, by priority)

2. **"As a user it should be easy to get a list of all my issues"**
   - Introduce concept of `user` or `current-user`
   - Config location TBD (env var? config file?)
   - Filter issues by assigned user

3. **"As a user I should be able to see what are the work being done in the current workstream and iteration"**
   - Show active work items (in-progress status)
   - Filter by current phase/workstream

4. **"As a user I should be able to see the priority of the issues"**
   - Priority visibility in list/stats views
   - Sort/filter by priority
