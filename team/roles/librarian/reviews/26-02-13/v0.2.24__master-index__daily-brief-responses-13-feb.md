# v0.2.24 — Master Index: Role Responses to Daily Brief (13 Feb 2026)

**Version:** v0.2.24
**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Role:** Librarian
**Context:** All impacted roles responded to the daily brief at `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/13/v0.2.16__daily-brief__sgraph-send-13-feb-2026.md`
**User amendments:** Rate limiting deferred (needs visualisation first); CORS already handled by osbot-fast-api.

---

## Read This First

Ten roles produced responses. The brief's central theme is **UX simplification** (hash-fragment URLs, text input) and **observability** (collect everything, store in S3, visualise). Two user amendments narrow the scope: rate limiting deferred, CORS already handled.

**The gating decision is resolved:** Architect + AppSec both approve the hash-fragment approach. Dev can proceed immediately.

## 1. Role Responses

| Role | File | Key Takeaway |
|---|---|---|
| **Architect** | [`v0.2.24__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md`](../../architect/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.24__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md) | Hash-fragment APPROVED. URL format: `#{transferId}/{base64urlKey}`. Token schema designed (indexed by token). i18n: JSON + runtime loader, en + pt first. Rate limiting deferred. CORS handled by framework. |
| **AppSec** | [`v0.2.24__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md`](../../appsec/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.24__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md) | Hash-fragment APPROVED. Hash never leaves client (RFC 3986 §3.5). Accepted risks: browser history (mitigate with `history.replaceState`), extensions (inherent). Text input: use `textContent` not `innerHTML`. Observability bucket must be separate from transfer storage. |
| **Dev** | [`v0.2.24__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md`](../../dev/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.24__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md) | 9 implementation tasks sized and sequenced. Hash-fragment: 2-3h. Text input: 4-6h. i18n foundation: 6-8h. Admin tokens: 8-12h. Recommended order: hash URLs → text input → i18n → landing page → email sharing → admin tokens → event data → themes. |
| **DevOps** | [`v0.2.24__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md`](../../devops/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.24__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md) | Comprehensive AWS logging brief. Tier 0 (active): Lambda CloudWatch, metrics, CORS. Tier 1 (enable now): CloudFront access logs, S3 access logs, CloudTrail, Lambda Insights. Cost: <$1/month at beta traffic. Collector pipeline: Load → Extract → Save with high-water marks. Rate limiting deferred. |
| **Conductor** | [`v0.2.24__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md`](../../conductor/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.24__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md) | 5-phase execution plan. Phase A (gating review): COMPLETE. Phase B (P1 implementation): hash URLs, text input, AWS logging — parallel. Phase C (foundations): i18n before content. Phase D (content): landing page, admin token UI. Phase E (observability): pipeline. 6 new decisions for Historian (D014–D019). |
| **QA** | [`v0.2.24__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md`](../../qa/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.24__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md) | 35 new tests needed across 7 areas. Current: 56 tests. Target: ~91. Hash-fragment: 6 tests. Text input: 6 tests. Admin tokens: 8 tests. i18n: 5 tests. Themes: 5 tests. Regression risk: MEDIUM (core download flow changes). |
| **Cartographer** | [`v0.2.24__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md`](../../cartographer/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.24__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md) | Updated data flow diagrams for hash-fragment URLs. New system component maps: observability pipeline, admin token system, i18n data flow. Updated security boundary map showing hash fragment stays in browser. Full dependency graph for all new features. |
| **Historian** | [`v0.2.24__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md`](../../historian/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.24__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md) | 10 new decisions logged (D014–D023). Milestone M003: first real user test. 4 decision patterns identified: user feedback driving architecture, deliberate deferral, symmetric design choices (hash vs query), architectural urgency recognition (i18n before content). |
| **Journalist** | [`v0.2.24__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md`](../../journalist/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.24__response-to-daily-brief__13-feb.md) | Landing page structure: hero ("Send files. Simply. Securely."), 3-step how-it-works, trust section. Email template drafted (brief, clear, branded). i18n content strategy: ~70 string keys across 8 categories. All content blocked by i18n module. |
| **Conductor** | (sequencing above) | Role coordination matrix: 11 tasks × lead/support/review assignments. Risk register updated: RF-10 (CORS) resolved, RF-11 (rate limiting) accepted-deferred. |

## 2. Cross-Cutting Themes

### 2.1 Hash-Fragment: Unanimous Approval

Both Architect and AppSec independently confirm:
- URL hash fragment never leaves the client (RFC 3986 §3.5)
- Not in HTTP requests, not in server logs, not in CloudFront logs, not in Referrer headers
- Zero-knowledge guarantee maintained
- Only new exposure: browser history (mitigated by `history.replaceState`)

**URL format agreed:** `https://send.sgraph.ai/send/v0/v0.1/v0.1.0/download.html#{transferId}/{base64urlKey}`

### 2.2 The i18n Sequencing Constraint

Multiple roles converge on the same insight: **i18n must ship before new content**. The Conductor's sequencing plan makes this explicit:
- Phase C (i18n foundation) blocks Phase D (landing page content, admin UI strings)
- The Journalist's ~70 string keys define the scope
- Dev estimates 6-8 hours for the i18n module + string extraction

This is the most important dependency in the entire brief. If content ships before i18n, it creates retrofit debt.

### 2.3 Observability Architecture Alignment

DevOps and Cartographer independently arrived at the same pipeline design:
- Collector layer with high-water marks per source
- S3 data lake with date-partitioned folders
- Separation of concerns: logs bucket ≠ transfer bucket (AppSec requirement)
- Visualisation through admin UI dashboards

### 2.4 Test Coverage: 56 → 91

QA estimates 35 new tests across all new features. The biggest clusters:
- Admin tokens (8 tests) — new backend functionality
- Hash-fragment + text input (12 tests) — core UX changes
- i18n + themes (10 tests) — foundation features

### 2.5 User Amendments Incorporated

Two directives from the user narrow scope and reduce work:

| Amendment | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Rate limiting deferred | DevOps Tier 3, not Tier 0. Observability first, then informed limits. |
| CORS handled by osbot-fast-api | No build work. DevOps to verify in smoke tests only. |
