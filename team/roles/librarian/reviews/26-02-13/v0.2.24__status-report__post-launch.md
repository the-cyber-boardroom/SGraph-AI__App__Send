## 3. Master Index Update Proposal

The current master index (`team/roles/librarian/reviews/26-02-10/v0.2.1__master-index__infrastructure-brief-responses.md`) covers the 10 Feb infrastructure brief responses. It needs a successor to cover:

### Proposed Structure: v0.2.24 Master Index

```
v0.2.24__master-index__post-launch-status.md

1. Context (launch milestone, version, what's live)
2. Role Status Reports (6 reports from 13 Feb)
   - AppSec: security review findings
   - DPO: privacy compliance gaps
   - Cartographer: topology drift
   - Historian: decisions D014-D020
   - Journalist: content plan
   - Librarian: this maintenance report
3. Cross-Cutting Concerns
   - Privacy debt (GA consent, privacy policy)
   - Security debt (referrer policy, rate limiting)
   - Documentation debt (system map outdated)
4. Consolidated Action Items (merged from all roles)
5. Documents Produced (full inventory)
```

## 4. Knowledge Base Health

| Metric | Value | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Total role review files (all dates) | ~25 | Growing |
| Roles with 13 Feb reviews | 7 (including this) | Good coverage |
| Roles without 13 Feb reviews | Architect, Dev, DevOps, QA, Conductor, GRC, Advocate, Ambassador, Sherpa | Expected (not all roles active today) |
| Master index currency | Stale (covers 10 Feb only) | Needs update |
| Issues FS currency | Unknown | Needs audit |

## 5. Immediate Actions

| # | Action | Priority |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1 | Create v0.2.24 master index incorporating all 13 Feb documents | P0 |
| 2 | Audit Issues FS for tasks completed by launch | P1 |
| 3 | Create new Issues FS tasks for privacy and security debt | P1 |
| 4 | Update CLAUDE.md "Current Sprint" section to reflect post-launch focus | P2 |

*The knowledge base grew significantly today. Indexing is the priority before the next sprint begins.*
