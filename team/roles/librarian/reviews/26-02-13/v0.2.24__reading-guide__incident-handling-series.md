## Overview

Dinis Cruz has published a 5-part series on incident handling philosophy and practice. These documents establish the foundation for how SGraph Send approaches security incidents — not as rare emergencies but as the single best opportunity to improve systemic resilience.

The command brief at `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/13/for-claude-code/v0.2.23__command__incident-series-full-team-activation.md` activates all roles to integrate this material.

## Recommended Reading Order

Read these in order. Each builds on the previous.

| # | Document | File | Core Idea |
|---|----------|------|-----------|
| 1 | **P3-as-P1 Philosophy** | `v0.2.23__briefs__incident-philosophy-p3-as-p1.md` | "What could have happened" matters more than "what happened." Analyse the full union of possible damage, not just actual damage. |
| 2 | **Running P3-as-P1 in Practice** | `v0.2.23__briefs__incident-practice-running-p3-as-p1.md` | The 7-step operational playbook: declare, assemble, situate, investigate, assess runbooks, document, close. Role activation matrix. |
| 3 | **Best Time to Fix Things** | `v0.2.23__briefs__incident-payoff-best-time-to-fix-things.md` | The 5x multiplier: 2 weeks of incident work equals 2 months of normal ops. Arguments vanish, alignment materialises, help arrives. |
| 4 | **Simulation, Communication, Escalation** | `v0.2.23__briefs__incident-simulation-communication-escalation.md` | Simulate before acting. Multi-audience stakeholder comms from one Issues FS source. Organic framework integration (MITRE ATT&CK, NIST). |
| 5 | **The Football Team** | `v0.2.23__briefs__incident-football-team-practice-and-preparation.md` | Practice makes real incidents look like exercises. The preparation spectrum: unprepared → practised → operationalised → automated. |

## Key Concepts Across All 5 Documents

### P3-as-P1
Treat every P3 (minor) incident as if it were P1 (critical). The systemic weakness is the same — the only difference is luck. Follow the "second stories" behind human error.

### The 5x Multiplier
During an incident, 2 weeks of work produces what normally takes 2 months. Arguments disappear. Alignment materialises. Help turns up. Focus replaces prioritisation debates.

### Every Role Is a Security Sensor
"How come this was possible?" is always a valid question from any role. Dev asks "how come our tests did not catch this?" QA asks "how come our matrix had this gap?" Librarian asks "how come this runbook was out of date?"

### Simulate Before Acting
Never take your first action in production. Model the response on a whiteboard (or in Issues FS) first. This applies to technical fixes, communications, and escalations.

### The Preparation Spectrum
For each incident type, move rightward: **Unprepared → Practised → Operationalised → Automated**. Tabletop exercises create practice. Runbooks create operationalisation. Detection rules create automation.

### Organic Framework Integration
Adopt MITRE ATT&CK, NIST, etc. one incident at a time. Each incident, add one or two techniques. After 20 incidents, you have organic coverage — earned through practice, not imposed through checklists.

## "For the Agents" Sections — Task Map

Each document contains a "For the Agents" section with role-specific tasks. Here is the consolidated map:

### From Document 1 (Philosophy)
- **CISO/AppSec:** Run the "second story" exercise on the git commit identity incident
- **Conductor:** Add P3-as-P1 criteria to the sprint briefing template
- **All roles:** Ask "how come this was possible?" after every incident

### From Document 2 (Practice)
- **Conductor:** Create the `incident-template.json` for Issues FS
- **All roles:** Update ROLE.md with an `## Incident Response` section
- **QA:** Add incident scenarios to the test matrix
- **DevOps:** Create the incident detection checklist for CI/CD

### From Document 3 (Payoff)
- **Conductor:** Schedule incident improvement sprints after each real incident
- **Librarian:** Maintain the "incident improvement backlog" in Issues FS
- **All roles:** When activated for an incident, identify one systemic improvement

### From Document 4 (Simulation & Communication)
- **Conductor:** Create multi-audience communication templates
- **CISO/AppSec:** Build the escalation matrix
- **Historian:** Track framework adoption per incident
- **Journalist:** Prepare communication drafts for each audience

### From Document 5 (Football Team)
- **QA:** Design tabletop exercise scenarios
- **Conductor:** Schedule monthly tabletop exercises
- **Sherpa:** Develop the "interactive incident replay" format
- **Journalist:** Write the post-incident narrative

## Command Brief Phases

The command brief (`v0.2.23__command__incident-series-full-team-activation.md`) requires 5 phases:

| Phase | Deliverable | Primary Role |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | This reading guide + catalogue | Librarian |
| 2 | Every ROLE.md updated with `## Incident Response` section | All roles |
| 3 | All actionable tasks extracted and filed in Issues FS | Conductor + CISO |
| 4 | Link to tabletop exercise (total AWS compromise) | CISO + Conductor |
| 5 | Journalist article on incident handling philosophy | Journalist |
