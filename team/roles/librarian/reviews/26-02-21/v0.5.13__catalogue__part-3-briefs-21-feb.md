## Agent Context Pages — Librarian Responsibilities

The Librarian is responsible for:

1. **Creating `context.md` per role** — consolidated LLM-ready context file
   - Project introduction (shared across all roles)
   - Role definition (from ROLE.md)
   - Current focus areas
   - Recent briefs and deliverables
   - Key decisions and rationale
   - Open questions and pending tasks
   - Relationships with other roles

2. **Maintaining the GitHub Pages site structure**:
   ```
   roles/{role}/context.md       — LLM-ready context
   roles/{role}/ROLE.md          — Role definition
   roles/{role}/recent/          — Latest briefs
   project/introduction.md       — Shared project preamble
   project/priorities.md         — Current priorities
   ```

3. **Context window budget**: each `context.md` must be under 20K tokens for Claude/GPT-4o, with a 1K-token summary section at the top for smaller models.

4. **Maintenance cadence**: update after each briefing session or daily.
