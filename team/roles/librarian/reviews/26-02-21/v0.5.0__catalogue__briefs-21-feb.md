## New Briefs Catalogued

Three briefs delivered on 21 Feb 2026. Together they define the **next build** (key discovery UI), the **architectural foundation** (chain of trust, key graphs, layered identity), and a **future capability** (secure pod for multi-user revocable encryption).

### 1. Developer Brief: Key Discovery UI and Public Registry

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Document | [`v0.4.27__dev-brief__key-discovery-and-public-registry.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/21/v0.4.27__dev-brief__key-discovery-and-public-registry.md) |
| Version | v0.4.27 |
| Team | Developer (lead), Designer, Architect |
| Classification | B3 as B1 / D1 |
| Status | **CURRENT PRIORITY — immediate next build** |
| Key Content | Two new admin pages: (1) Friendly Key Lookup (`/admin/key-lookup.html`) — find public key by short alphanumeric code (6-8 chars); (2) Public Key Registry (`/admin/key-registry.html`) — browsable list of all published keys with certificate transparency log. 4 new API endpoints (`POST/GET/DELETE /api/keys`, `GET /api/keys`). Publish button on existing `pki.html`. 10 acceptance criteria. Shared utility extraction (`pki-common.js`). |
| Design Principle | **No plaintext on server** — only encrypted blobs, tokens (Obj_Ids), and public keys. Friendly names exist only client-side (IndexedDB). Eliminates metadata leakage and injection attack surface by design. |

### 2. Architecture Brief: Chain of Trust, Key Graphs, and Layered Identity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Document | [`v0.4.27__architecture__chain-of-trust-and-key-graphs.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/21/v0.4.27__architecture__chain-of-trust-and-key-graphs.md) |
| Version | v0.4.27 |
| Team | Architect (lead), AppSec, Developer |
| Classification | Architecture brief — PKI trust model design |
| Status | **DESIGN WORK** — informs future builds; research tasks assigned |
| Key Content | 6 major sections: (1) Key Graph as chain-of-trust — trust propagation from one verified key to an entire group; (2) Git-style hash chaining — append-only tamper-evident commit chain for all trust graph changes; (3) Key rotation — identity-anchored (OAuth/Cognito), multi-device support; (4) Natural revocation via graph maintenance — no CRLs/OCSP, revocation = removing an edge; (5) Layered key identity — 4 layers (API key, device/session, persona, admin) with challenge-response auth; (6) PKI-encrypted personalised web delivery — entire HTML/CSS/JS encrypted per-user via Service Worker. |
| Research Tasks | 10 tasks assigned (D1-D3 priority): trust graph schema, hash chaining, challenge-response protocol, key rotation flow, data room prototype, encrypted page delivery, AppSec reviews (equivocation, replay), Signal/Wire/Keybase research, Google Key Transparency research. |

### 3. Architecture Brief: Secure Pod — Multi-User Revocable Encryption

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Document | [`v0.4.27__architecture__secure-pod-multi-user-encryption.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/21/v0.4.27__architecture__secure-pod-multi-user-encryption.md) |
| Version | v0.4.27 |
| Team | Architect (lead), AppSec, Developer |
| Classification | Architecture brief — future capability |
| Status | **RESEARCH** — implementation dependent on customer demand |
| Key Content | Solves the "encryption trilemma" (zero-knowledge + multi-user + revocable access). Introduces the **Secure Pod** — an intermediary enclave that decrypts with its own key, re-encrypts per-request for the specific user, then forgets. User never holds a key that works on stored content. Maximum damage model: server compromise = zero exposure; user key theft = only documents actually opened; pod + server compromise = total. Two operation modes: Mode 1 (Direct PKI, current) and Mode 2 (Pod-Mediated, future). 5 implementation options (Nitro Enclave, separate AWS account, HSM, client-side pod, third-party enclave). 7-phase implementation roadmap. Pod compromise response protocol with micro-payment budget as security control. |

## Foundational Design Principle (All 3 Briefs)

> **Only encrypted blobs and tokens on the server.** No strings, no folder names, no user names, no labels, no metadata in plaintext. Everything is an Obj_Id or ciphertext. Human-readable names exist only client-side (IndexedDB) or inside encrypted blobs. This eliminates metadata leakage, injection attacks, and traffic analysis — by design, not by policy.
