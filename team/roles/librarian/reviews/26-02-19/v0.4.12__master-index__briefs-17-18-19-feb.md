## Read This First

This index covers **three days of unindexed briefs** (17, 18, 19 February 2026) -- the largest single intake since the project began. The version has advanced from v0.4.4 (the previous index) to v0.4.12, reflecting intensive activity across both teams.

The three days mark a shift from internal building to **external engagement**. The project received its first external security review (29 findings), its first beta user feature feedback, conducted its first user interview (Levente Simon, via LLM voice mode), observed real users in the field, distributed physical business cards at an industry dinner, and encountered a stranger on the tube who spontaneously named the product "Signal for the web."

**Key arc across these three days:**

1. **17 Feb** -- P1 incident declared: first external security review. 29 findings processed, zero-knowledge model validated. First beta user confirms product works.
2. **18 Feb** -- Strategic expansion: new Accountant role (19th role), partner ecosystem strategy, encrypted mini chat concept, UX research from live user observation, User A interview captured.
3. **19 Feb** -- Community inflection: industry dinner validation, visitor programme designed, operational maturity (runbooks, chaos agent, fire drills), post-quantum crypto research, secure browser integration concept.

**Total documents catalogued:** 20 briefs + 1 interview + 10 incident pack files + 10 team response files = **41 documents**

## 3. Documents Catalogued: 19 February 2026

### 3.1 Daily Brief

| Document | Version | Team | Status | Key Takeaway |
|----------|---------|------|--------|--------------|
| [`v0.4.11__daily-brief__19-feb-2026.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/19/v0.4.11__daily-brief__19-feb-2026.md) | v0.4.11 | All | **COMPLETELY UNPROCESSED** | 5 voice memos (evening 18 Feb + morning 19 Feb). Cross-cutting themes: the product sells itself when people touch it, the browser is the platform, shift from closed team to open community, operational maturity acceleration. Orphan topics: "how to learn about what we're doing" public page, Dropbox encryption verification, business card workflow as template, "Signal for the web" tagline strategy. New items: Chaos Agent (future role, placeholder), Visitor (new category, not a role). |

### 3.2 Topic Briefs

| Document | Version | Lead Roles | Status | Key Takeaway |
|----------|---------|------------|--------|--------------|
| [`v0.4.11__brief__industry-dinner-debrief-and-validation.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/19/v0.4.11__brief__industry-dinner-debrief-and-validation.md) | v0.4.11 | Ambassador, Sherpa, Designer | **COMPLETELY UNPROCESSED** | Industry dinner (18 Feb evening) field notes. Business cards distributed (6 cards, handwritten access codes). Tube story: stranger spontaneously called the product "Signal for the web." Dropbox perception gap (technical user surprised Dropbox isn't E2E encrypted). GitHub page has broken images -- needs immediate fix. Card distribution validated as acquisition channel. |
| [`v0.4.11__brief__post-quantum-cryptography-research.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/19/v0.4.11__brief__post-quantum-cryptography-research.md) | v0.4.11 | Architect, AppSec, Developer | **COMPLETELY UNPROCESSED** | Triggered by industry dinner question. AES-256-GCM is relatively quantum-resistant (Grover reduces to AES-128 equivalent, still secure). Real PQC risk is when we add asymmetric crypto (PKI). Research needed: NIST PQC standards, browser WASM implementations, performance benchmarks. Business need: credible PQC story for financial/regulated verticals. Hybrid mode (AES + PQC) likely the right 2026 answer. |
| [`v0.4.11__brief__guest-visitor-programme.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/19/v0.4.11__brief__guest-visitor-programme.md) | v0.4.11 | Librarian, Advocate, Sherpa | **COMPLETELY UNPROCESSED** | New "Visitor" category for external contributors. Welcome letter, Visitor `.claude.md`, platform-specific getting-started guides (ChatGPT, Claude, Claude Code). "Talk to an Agent" instructions. Interview briefs for visitors. Challenges and Easter eggs for gamified exploration. OpenAI GPT with live repo access research. `team/visitors/` folder structure defined. First visitor: Manuel. |
| [`v0.4.11__brief__ui-bugs-and-improvements.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/19/v0.4.11__brief__ui-bugs-and-improvements.md) | v0.4.11 | Designer, Developer | **COMPLETELY UNPROCESSED** | 2 bugs: navigation active state, drag-and-drop area too large. 4 improvements: test file drag-and-drop from UI, in-browser image/PDF rendering after decryption (sandboxed), auto-upload mode (feature flag), delete button for both sender and recipient. Delete button aligns with User A's Firefox Send `delete_secret` suggestion. |
| [`v0.4.11__brief__surf-security-browser-integration.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/19/v0.4.11__brief__surf-security-browser-integration.md) | v0.4.11 | Ambassador, Architect, AppSec | **COMPLETELY UNPROCESSED** | Partnership concept with Surf Security (secure enterprise browser). 6 integration ideas: browser-managed key storage, PKI via browser, links that only work in secure browser, device/network/session posture assessment, enforced self-expiring messages (view-once with DLP), secure copy-paste between SG/Send instances. Connects to Chrome extension detection research from security review. Applies to any enterprise secure browser (Island, Talon/Palo Alto). |
| [`v0.4.11__brief__chaos-agent-runbooks-fire-drills.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/19/v0.4.11__brief__chaos-agent-runbooks-fire-drills.md) | v0.4.11 | GRC, AppSec, Conductor | **COMPLETELY UNPROCESSED** | Operational maturity: Chaos Agent (future role -- Netflix Chaos Monkey adapted for agentic teams), severity runbooks (P0--P10 with detection/assessment/escalation/response/mitigation/recovery/post-mortem), fire drill schedule (monthly P3--P5, quarterly P1--P2, annually P0). Special runbooks: "turn it off" procedure, cost spike, token compromise, external security disclosure, service degradation. P0 runbook is P1 priority. |

## 4. Key Themes Across 17--19 February

### Theme 1: External Validation Loop (17--19 Feb)

The project has entered a validation cycle with real external actors:

| Day | External Actor | Validation |
|-----|---------------|------------|
| 17 Feb | User A (Levente Simon) | Full security review, 29 findings. Crypto is sound. "I can't tell you how many times I've needed something like this." |
| 17 Feb | User B (community) | Tested product, confirmed it works. 3 feature requests (all already on roadmap). |
| 18 Feb | User A interview | Deep interview via LLM voice mode. "Foolproof." "I don't know who wouldn't need this." |
| 18 Feb | Live user observation | UX research: "what's next?" problem identified. User's hook was convenience, not encryption. |
| 19 Feb | Industry dinner (6+ people) | Business cards distributed. Dropbox comparison understood immediately. Agentic team model generated interest. |
| 19 Feb | Tube stranger | Tried product in real time. Spontaneously: "Signal for the web." |

### Theme 2: Product Direction Shift -- Utility to Platform

The product vision is evolving rapidly:

- **17 Feb**: File transfer + security hardening focus
- **18 Feb**: Encrypted mini chat concept, shared key relationships, real-time transfer visibility -- shifting toward "ongoing secure communication channel"
- **19 Feb**: Secure browser integration (enterprise platform), visitor programme (community platform), post-quantum preparedness (regulated-industry platform)

The arc is: file transfer tool --> communication tool --> platform.

### Theme 3: Organisational Maturity

| Day | Maturity Signal |
|-----|-----------------|
| 17 Feb | P1 incident response protocol executed (first external security disclosure) |
| 18 Feb | 19th role (Accountant) introduced. Cost measurement, externality accounting, maturity classification. |
| 19 Feb | Runbooks and fire drills planned. Chaos Agent conceptualised. Visitor programme designed (community opening). |

### Theme 4: The "No Installation Required" Value Proposition

Independently confirmed by three separate sources:

1. **User A** (17 Feb): "If you use Signal, Proton, or whatever else, the other party needs the same tech, which is not always the case, right?"
2. **Live user observation** (18 Feb): The hook was "this is a way for me to send information from A to B in a better way, and it doesn't require anything to be installed"
3. **Tube stranger** (19 Feb): "Signal for the web" -- four words capturing the proposition

### Theme 5: Content Licensing

Starting 18 Feb, all briefs include the Creative Commons BY 4.0 footer. The Librarian should audit all existing materials and add the CC BY footer where missing.

---

## 5. New Roles, Categories, and Concepts Introduced

| Item | Type | Day | Status |
|------|------|-----|--------|
| **Accountant** | Role #19 (both teams) | 18 Feb | Defined, not yet onboarded |
| **Chaos Agent** | Future role (placeholder) | 19 Feb | Prerequisites: runbooks, monitoring, separate environments |
| **Visitor** | New category (not a role) | 19 Feb | Folder structure defined, not yet created |

### 6.2 Previous Decisions Still Active

All decisions D038--D047 from the v0.4.4 index remain active. Notable interactions:

- D038 (encrypted workflow platform vision) reinforced by encrypted mini chat concept (18 Feb) and secure browser integration (19 Feb)
- D042 (Translator is Villager-exclusive) still holds -- Accountant is NOT team-exclusive (both teams)
- D044 (daily memo workflow: Architect + Librarian process first) still active -- this index is the Librarian's catch-up for 3 days of backlog

## 8. Urgent Items Requiring Team Processing

### Priority 1 -- Immediate Action Required

| Item | Why Urgent | Owner |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **P3 security fixes** (token validation fails-open, localStorage plaintext, token race condition) | Must fix before any production release. Security review findings with real exploitability. | Developer, AppSec |
| **P0 "pull the plug" runbook** | No documented procedure exists for taking the service offline in an emergency. | GRC, DevOps |
| **P1 major incident runbook** | The security review incident was handled ad-hoc; need a formalised procedure. | GRC, AppSec |
| **Fix broken GitHub images** | Customer-facing surface with broken content, observed by tube stranger in real time. | Developer, Designer |
| **README accuracy** | Claims about salted IP hashing are false. Public documentation must match implementation. | GRC, Developer |

### Priority 2 -- Should Process This Week

| Item | Why Important | Owner |
|------|--------------|-------|
| **Ambassador briefs (5 documents)** | Investor docs, accountant pitch, and agentic team article are ready for Ambassador review and refinement. These are customer/partner-facing materials. | Ambassador |
| **User A and User B stakeholder communications** | Two engaged users waiting for formal response. Sets the standard for all future user relationships. | Sherpa, Journalist |
| **User A interview processing** | Rich interview data not yet processed into user insights, marketing quotes, or case study. | Journalist, Sherpa, Ambassador |
| **Accountant role onboarding** | 19th role defined but not formally created (no ROLE.md, no folder structure). | Conductor |
| **Visitor programme setup** | First visitor (Manuel) expected; `team/visitors/` folder structure not yet created. | Librarian |
| **UX improvements from observation** | Progressive disclosure, post-encryption page redesign, download page simplification. Fresh user data -- act while insights are current. | Designer, Developer |

### Priority 3 -- Schedule for Coming Sprints

| Item | Owner |
|------|-------|
| One-click deployment packaging (Docker, CloudFormation, PyPI) | DevOps, Developer |
| Partner manifesto document | Ambassador |
| Post-quantum cryptography research | Architect, AppSec, Developer |

3. **18 Feb User A interview** -- rich validation data, quotable moments, and partnership signal (Dethernety)
4. **19 Feb industry dinner debrief** -- the "Signal for the web" moment, business card validation, GitHub fix urgency
5. **18 Feb Accountant role brief** -- the 19th role introduces cost measurement and externality accounting
6. **18 Feb encrypted chat brief** -- product direction shift from utility to relationship tool
7. **19 Feb chaos agent + runbooks brief** -- operational maturity acceleration, P0 runbook is urgent
8. **17 Feb ambassador briefs** (skim) -- ready for Ambassador processing, customer-facing materials
9. Remaining briefs as needed by role
