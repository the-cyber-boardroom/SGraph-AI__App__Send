# v0.4.16 -- Librarian Note: ChatGPT Voice Mode Workflow for INC-004 Questionnaire

**Version:** v0.4.16
**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Role:** Librarian
**Team:** Explorer
**Related:** [Voice interview brief](../../appsec/reviews/26-02-19/v0.4.12__voice-interview__INC-004-content-sensitivity.md), [User responses](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/19/incident/v0.4.15__incident-004__dinis-answers-to-interview.md)

## Context

The AppSec role created a voice interview brief (`v0.4.12__voice-interview__INC-004-content-sensitivity.md`) containing a prompt for ChatGPT voice mode to guide the affected user through the INC-004 content sensitivity questionnaire. The Data Controller (Dinis Cruz) used it at approximately 17:00 on 19 February 2026.

This note records observations about the workflow — both the successful outcome and the friction encountered.

---

## Outcome

The workflow succeeded. The voice interview produced a clean, structured markdown response with all 7 questions answered, an ICO notification assessment table, and a clear recommendation (no ICO notification required — Level 1 Public data). The output followed the template specified in the prompt almost exactly.

**Time from prompt to structured output:** ~5-10 minutes (voice conversation)
**Quality of output:** High — matched the requested markdown structure, included direct quotes, produced actionable ICO recommendation

## ChatGPT Voice Mode Access Observations (19 Feb 2026, ~17:00)

Three access issues were encountered before the workflow could begin:

| # | Observation | Impact |
|---|------------|--------|
| 1 | **Non-logged-in ChatGPT does not offer voice mode** — attempting to use voice mode without a ChatGPT account required login first | Blocks anonymous/quick use; user must have a ChatGPT account |
| 2 | **"Anonymous" mode (temporary chat) raised an error** — after logging in, attempting to use anonymous/temporary chat mode with voice failed with an error on 19 Feb 2026 at ~17:00 | Prevents privacy-conscious usage; forces conversation to be stored in ChatGPT history |
| 3 | **Normal chat mode worked** — pasting the prompt into a standard (logged-in, history-enabled) chat, then switching to voice mode, worked successfully | The functional path, but requires accepting ChatGPT's data retention |

### Implications for Future Voice Interview Briefs

These observations matter for the broader pattern of using LLM voice mode as a data collection method:

1. **Account requirement:** Any voice interview brief we send to external users (e.g., User A security reviewer) requires them to have a ChatGPT account (or equivalent LLM with voice capability). This is a friction point — not everyone has one.

2. **Privacy trade-off:** The interview content (including breach details, sensitivity assessments, personal data classifications) is processed through ChatGPT's servers and stored in the user's chat history. For INC-004 this is acceptable (Level 1 Public data), but for higher-sensitivity breaches, this creates a secondary data exposure vector.

3. **Workflow: paste-then-switch.** The successful path was: paste the prompt as text → then switch to voice mode. This is a non-obvious UX pattern. Future briefs should make this explicit in the instructions.

## Updates to Knowledge Base

| Item | Action |
|------|--------|
| Voice interview as a pattern | **Validated** — second successful use (after User A interview brief v0.4.9). Add to patterns catalogue. |
| ChatGPT voice mode access constraints | **New knowledge** — document as known limitation for external-facing voice briefs |
| INC-004 questionnaire status | **Complete** — user responses collected, ICO notification not required |
| Paste-then-switch workflow | **Add to instructions** — future voice briefs should explicitly state "paste as text first, then switch to voice mode" |
