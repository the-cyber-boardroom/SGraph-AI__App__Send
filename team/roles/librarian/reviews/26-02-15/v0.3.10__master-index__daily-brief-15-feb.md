## 1. Brief Summary

The v0.3.10 daily brief is the first **Explorer-team-specific brief** following the v0.3.0 team split into Explorer and Villager tracks. It covers three major themes:

1. **Progress shipped** -- Cache service LETS pipeline live, AWS logging fully configured, privacy-by-design validated through DPO role presence, end-to-end admin flow confirmed.

2. **UX fixes and features** (12 items) -- Six user-facing bug fixes and improvements (download page loading, token expiry messages, token-aware page state, upload progress granularity, navigation guards, three-word key exploration), plus six admin-facing items (Analytics Pulse fix, IFD version switching, token fetch performance, admin UI links, end-to-end timing capture, three missing UI elements).

3. **Server Analytics (SA) deep dive** -- Architecture for the SA dashboard including the LETS pipeline for both event-driven data (logs) and collected data (API calls), the digital twin concept, smart collection principles, path-based routing for the SA dashboard, and four priority views (cache browser, Lambda functions, CloudFront logs, AWS infrastructure overview).

The brief also introduces the **upload/download resilience research** workstream as a strategically critical item for the large-file-transfer sweet spot.

### Key Decisions Embedded in Brief

| ID | Decision | Status |
|----|----------|--------|
| D038 | SA dashboard uses path-based URLs (not hash-fragment) | APPROVED |
| D039 | Cache service browser is highest-priority SA view | APPROVED |
| D040 | Three-word key concept requires security review before any implementation | APPROVED |
| D041 | Upload/download resilience research starts immediately (separate detailed briefing coming) | APPROVED |
| D042 | Privacy by design validated -- DPO role prevents IP capture in logging config | CONFIRMED |

---

## 2. Role-Task Mapping

The brief assigns 21 discrete tasks across 8 roles (with the Conductor receiving orchestration guidance). Tasks are grouped by the brief's own priority scheme (P1/P2/P3).

### 3.3 AppSec

**Read from brief:** Section 1 (three-word keys -- security implications).

**Tasks assigned (1 item, P3):**

| Priority | Task | Co-owner | Dependency |
|----------|------|----------|------------|
| **P3** | Three-word key concept security review (#20) | Architect, Advocate | None -- **blocks Dev implementation** |

**Scope of review:**
- Entropy analysis: what is the entropy of three random words from a standard dictionary? (e.g., 2048 words = 33 bits for three words -- compare to 256-bit AES key)
- Can both lookup ID and decryption key be derived from the same three words, or must they be separated?
- Brute-force attack surface: with a known three-word scheme, what is the time to enumerate?
- Trademark/patent check on "What Three Words" and similar concepts
- Risk classification: for which threat models is this acceptable vs. unacceptable?
- Recommendation: go/no-go with conditions

**Existing AppSec documents to reference:**
- `team/roles/appsec/reviews/26-02-14/v0.3.2__action-plan__explorer-next-steps.md` -- most recent

---

### 3.4 Designer

**Read from brief:** Section 3 (token usage display).

**Tasks assigned (1 item, P2):**

| Priority | Task | Co-owner | Dependency |
|----------|------|----------|------------|
| **P2** | Token usage UI design (#14) | Dev | None -- **Dev waits for spec** |

**Scope:**
- Design the token usage counter display: "3 of 10 uses remaining"
- Design the token confirmation display: "Token accepted: community-beta-2025"
- Consider placement in the upload flow -- when and where does the user see this?
- Consider the payment model visibility angle: this is the beginning of showing users that usage has a budget

### 3.5 DevOps

**Read from brief:** SA Deep Dive section (S3-triggered Lambda, LETS pipeline architecture).

**Tasks assigned (1 item, P2):**

| Priority | Task | Co-owner | Dependency |
|----------|------|----------|------------|
| **P2** | S3-triggered Lambda configuration for LETS pipeline (#15) | Dev | None -- **Dev waits for S3 event config** |

**Scope:**
- Configure S3 event notifications to trigger a Lambda function when log files land in the log buckets
- Coordinate with existing AWS logging configuration (already confirmed working)
- Ensure the Lambda has the correct IAM permissions to read source S3 objects and write to the cache service bucket
- Define the trigger pattern (which S3 prefixes, which event types)

---

### 3.6 QA

**Read from brief:** All UX bug fix sections (2, 4, 5, 10, 12), all new feature sections (3, 8, 11), SA dashboard section.

**Tasks assigned (no explicit tasks in the brief, but implied):**

| Priority | Task | Dependency |
|----------|------|------------|
| **P2** | Define test strategy for P1 bug fixes (items #1-#6) | Dev starts implementing |
| **P2** | Define test strategy for SA dashboard views | Cache browser built |
| **P3** | Update the admin UI test plan (46 tests from v0.3.0) for new features | All P2 features |

**Scope:**
- The brief does not explicitly call out QA tasks, but each of the 7 P1 fixes and 10 P2 features needs test coverage
- Focus first on regression tests for the bug fixes (token expiry, loading state, navigation guards, upload progress)
- The SA dashboard introduces path-based routing -- needs URL-based test cases
- The three missing UI elements (API call log, event log, message panel) need integration test coverage

**Existing QA documents to reference:**
- `team/roles/qa/reviews/26-02-14/v0.3.0__response-to-daily-brief__14-feb.md` -- admin UI test strategy (46 tests)
- `team/roles/qa/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__response-to-daily-brief-2__13-feb.md` -- previous test plan

### 3.7 Conductor

**Read from brief:** "For the Conductor" section at the end of the brief.

**Tasks assigned (orchestration):**

The brief provides explicit conductor guidance:

1. **Three tracks to manage:**
   - **Track A: UX bug fixes** (P1 items #1-#6, plus admin bugs #4, #10) -- ship fast
   - **Track B: Server Analytics foundation** (cache browser as gating item, then fan out)
   - **Track C: Upload/download resilience research** (start early, non-blocking)

2. **Key sequencing decisions:**
   - User-facing bugs (#1, #2, #3, #5, #6) before admin-facing bugs (#4, #10, #11)
   - Token fetch performance (#10) is **blocked by** Architect cache mapping (#9) -- do not let Dev guess
   - Cache browser (#7) is the SA gating item -- build first, then Lambda views, CloudFront, cost dashboards

3. **Resource allocation:**
   - Dev is heavily loaded (20 tasks). Conductor should prioritise ruthlessly.
   - Architect has 5 tasks, two of which are blocking (cache mapping, routing design). Prioritise those.
   - AppSec, Designer, DevOps each have 1 task. Ensure they are not starved of context.

**Existing Conductor documents to reference:**
- `team/roles/conductor/reviews/26-02-14/v0.3.2__action-plan__explorer-next-steps.md` -- most recent
- `team/roles/conductor/reviews/26-02-14/v0.3.0__response-to-daily-brief__14-feb.md` -- v0.3.0 response

---

### 3.8 Advocate

**Read from brief:** Section 1 (three-word keys -- UX perspective).

**Tasks assigned (1 item, P3):**

| Priority | Task | Co-owner | Dependency |
|----------|------|----------|------------|
| **P3** | Three-word key UX evaluation (#20) | Architect, AppSec | None |

**Scope:**
- Evaluate: how much easier does three-word sharing make the experience vs. current key+URL approach?
- Consider: voice-sharing ("the password is sunset-bicycle-ocean"), mobile-friendliness, memorability
- Compare with current flow: copy URL, share URL, recipient clicks URL
- Identify user segments where this matters most (non-technical users, phone-based sharing)

**Existing Advocate documents to reference:**
- `team/roles/advocate/reviews/26-02-14/v0.3.2__action-plan__explorer-next-steps.md` -- most recent
- `team/roles/advocate/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.33__review__v0.1.3-wrap-up-and-linkedin.md` -- UX review context

## 4. Dependency Graph

The brief creates several blocking dependencies that the Conductor must manage:

```
Architect: cache service usage mapping (#9)
    |
    +---> Dev: fix token fetch performance (#10)

Architect: path-based routing design (#17)
    |
    +---> Dev: build cache service browser (#7)
    +---> Dev: build Lambda dashboard (#12)
    +---> Dev: build CloudFront viewer (#13)
    +---> Dev: build AWS infrastructure overview (#21)
    +---> Cartographer: update system maps

Architect: IFD version manifest spec (#11)
    |
    +---> Dev: implement version switcher (#11)

AppSec: three-word key security review (#20)
    |
    +---> Architect: technical feasibility (#20)
    +---> Dev: implementation (BLOCKED until review complete)

Designer: token usage UI spec (#14)
    |
    +---> Dev: implement token usage display (#14)

DevOps: S3 event trigger configuration (#15)
    |
    +---> Dev: implement LETS Lambda (#15)
    +---> Dev: implement delta tracking (#22)

Dev: cache service browser (#7)
    |
    +---> Dev: Lambda dashboard (#12)
    +---> Dev: CloudFront viewer (#13)
    +---> Dev: AWS infrastructure overview (#21)
```

**Critical path:** Architect routing design -> Dev cache browser -> Dev Lambda/CloudFront/infrastructure views

**Key unblocking actions:**
1. Architect produces cache service usage mapping -- unblocks Dev token performance fix
2. Architect produces path-based routing design -- unblocks all SA dashboard views
3. AppSec produces three-word key review -- unblocks Architect + Dev on that feature

---

## 5. Documents Already Produced for 15 Feb

The following documents already exist in `26-02-15` review folders before this master index was created:

| Role | File | Topic |
|------|------|-------|
| **Architect** | `team/roles/architect/reviews/26-02-15/v0.3.6__implementation-proposal__observability-pipeline.md` | Observability pipeline implementation proposal |
| **DevOps** | `team/roles/devops/reviews/26-02-15/v0.3.8__deployment-checklist__observability-pipeline.md` | Observability pipeline deployment checklist |
| **Designer** | `team/roles/designer/reviews/26-02-15/v0.3.3__brief__cruz-and-cruz-design-agency.md` | Cruz and Cruz design agency brief |
| **Designer** | `team/roles/designer/reviews/26-02-15/v0.3.3__brief__kickoff-presentation-for-cruz-and-cruz.md` | Design agency kickoff presentation |

These indicate that work on the observability/SA pipeline and design agency brief has already begun, partially addressing tasks #15 (LETS pipeline) and #14 (design context for UI work).

## 6. Cross-Reference to Previous Index

The v0.3.0 master index (`team/roles/librarian/reviews/26-02-14/v0.3.0__master-index__daily-brief-responses-14-feb.md`) documented:

- **3 of 14 roles** had responded to the v0.3.0 brief (QA, Cartographer, Librarian)
- **11 roles** were pending responses
- **D014-D037** decisions logged
- **RF-01 to RF-32** risk register entries
- **111+ backend tests** existing
- **46 admin UI tests** planned

This v0.3.10 brief supersedes the v0.3.0 brief's "What's Next" directive (admin UI Priority 1) with a broader scope: UX bug fixes + SA dashboard + resilience research. The admin UI work continues but is now part of the SA dashboard track rather than a standalone priority.

---

*This master index should be read first for any v0.3.10 session context. The brief marks the beginning of the Explorer team's focused workstream on Server Analytics, UX polish, and resilience research. The critical unblocking actions are: (1) Architect produces cache service usage mapping, (2) Architect produces path-based routing design, and (3) AppSec produces three-word key security review. The Dev role carries the heaviest load with 20 tasks and should be sequenced per the Conductor's three-track guidance.*
