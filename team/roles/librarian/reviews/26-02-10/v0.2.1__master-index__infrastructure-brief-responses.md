**Version:** v0.2.1
**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Role:** Librarian
**Context:** All roles responded to the Conductor's v0.1.4 infrastructure brief at `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/2026-02-10/v0.1.4__briefs__focus-on-mvp-release-infrastructure.md`

## Read This First

Eight roles produced responses. Here's the executive summary of what each role found, followed by cross-cutting themes.

## 1. Role Responses

| Role | File | Key Takeaway |
|---|---|---|
| **Architect** | [`team/roles/architect/reviews/26-02-10/v0.2.1__response-to-infrastructure-brief.md`](../../../architect/reviews/26-02-10/v0.2.1__response-to-infrastructure-brief.md) | 7 deployment targets reduce to 4 unique patterns (Lambda, Container, Server, CLI). Storage backend selection via env var. Lambda 6MB response limit (not 20MB). GCP can use AWS S3 cross-cloud for MVP. |
| **DevOps** | [`team/roles/devops/reviews/26-02-10/v0.2.1__response-to-infrastructure-brief.md`](../../../devops/reviews/26-02-10/v0.2.1__response-to-infrastructure-brief.md) | Current CI does tests + tag + PyPI. Target CI adds deploy + smoke test per target. Phased rollout: Lambda first, Docker second, then Fargate/EC2/AMI/GCP. Reusable smoke test action. |
| **QA** | [`team/roles/qa/reviews/26-02-10/v0.2.1__response-to-infrastructure-brief.md`](../../../qa/reviews/26-02-10/v0.2.1__response-to-infrastructure-brief.md) | Full test matrix: 4 storage modes × 8 targets × 5 test levels. Currently 7 tests; estimated 55-80+ needed. Critical gaps: no transfer tests, no encryption tests, no auth tests. |
| **AppSec** | [`team/roles/appsec/reviews/26-02-10/v0.2.1__response-to-infrastructure-brief.md`](../../../appsec/reviews/26-02-10/v0.2.1__response-to-infrastructure-brief.md) | AES-256-GCM "wrong key = clear error" is inherent (no code needed). IV must be prepended to ciphertext. No-plaintext guarantee needs automated verification in smoke tests. Container images need vulnerability scanning. |
| **Dev** | [`team/roles/dev/reviews/26-02-10/v0.2.1__response-to-infrastructure-brief.md`](../../../dev/reviews/26-02-10/v0.2.1__response-to-infrastructure-brief.md) | 12-step build order: schemas → storage wrapper → services → User Lambda → entry points → frontend → CLI. Admin Lambda is the template; User Lambda mirrors it. |
| **Cartographer** | [`team/roles/cartographer/reviews/26-02-10/v0.2.1__response-to-infrastructure-brief.md`](../../../cartographer/reviews/26-02-10/v0.2.1__response-to-infrastructure-brief.md) | Dependency graphs showing what blocks what. Docker/Fargate/GCP share a container; EC2/AMI share systemd. CI pipeline mapped as 4 stages: Validate → Build → Deploy → E2E. |
| **Historian** | [`team/roles/historian/reviews/26-02-10/v0.2.1__response-to-infrastructure-brief.md`](../../../historian/reviews/26-02-10/v0.2.1__response-to-infrastructure-brief.md) | 13 decisions logged (D001–D013). Key pattern: scope expanded from Lambda-only to 7 targets, but Architect/Cartographer grouped to 4. Conductor retains CI/CD ownership. Jekyll approved for Journalist site. |
| **Journalist** | [`team/roles/journalist/reviews/26-02-10/v0.2.1__response-to-infrastructure-brief.md`](../../../journalist/reviews/26-02-10/v0.2.1__response-to-infrastructure-brief.md) | Content plan: "How It Works" and transparency explainer as P0. Jekyll site (Conductor decision). Three key messages drafted for beta launch. |

## 2. Cross-Cutting Themes

### 2.1 The "4 Not 7" Insight

Both Architect and Cartographer independently identified that 7 deployment targets reduce to 4 unique deployment patterns:

| Pattern | Targets | Entry Point |
|---|---|---|
| Lambda | Lambda | Mangum |
| Container | Docker, ECS Fargate, GCP Cloud Run | uvicorn in Docker |
| Server | EC2, AMI | uvicorn + systemd |
| CLI | CLI tool | Direct library import |

**Implication:** DevOps needs 4 unique configs, not 7. Infrastructure effort is ~60% of what it appeared.

### 2.2 Critical Path to "Done"

Combining Dev's build order and Cartographer's dependency graph:

```
Schemas → Storage Wrapper → Transfer Service → User Lambda → Frontend → E2E
                                                     ↓
                                               Uvicorn entry point → Dockerfile → All other targets
```

**Blocked:** Storage wrapper for S3 needs the Memory-FS S3 class from Conductor.
**Not blocked:** Everything through in-memory backend (which covers schemas, services, Lambda, tests).

### 2.3 Test Coverage Gap

QA estimates 55-80+ tests needed (currently 7). The most critical gaps:
- No transfer lifecycle test (the core product feature)
- No encryption/decryption test
- No auth enforcement test
- No storage adapter test

All of these can be written NOW using the in-memory backend.

### 2.4 Security Wins and Concerns

AppSec confirms:
- AES-256-GCM inherently prevents silent corruption (wrong key = clear error)
- No-plaintext guarantee needs automated smoke test verification
- IV/nonce management needs documenting (standard: prepend 12 bytes)
- Lambda response limit is 6MB (corrects Cartographer's risk register)

### 2.5 New Decisions This Sprint

Historian logged 13 decisions. The most impactful:
- **D001:** 7 deployment targets (expanded from Lambda-only)
- **D010:** Grouped to 4 patterns (Architect/Cartographer simplification)
- **D013:** Jekyll for Journalist website (Conductor decision)
