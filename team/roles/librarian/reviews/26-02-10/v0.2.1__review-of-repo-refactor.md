# v0.2.1 -- Librarian Review of Repo Refactor

**Version:** v0.2.1
**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Role:** Librarian
**Trigger:** Commit `cbf812556acb931dfc3868c70bcdbfd8e1e640b7` -- Conductor repo reorganisation

---

## 1. Summary

The Conductor performed a major structural refactor of the repository, creating a `team/` top-level folder and reorganising role directories and documentation. This review documents what was moved, identifies and fixes all broken internal links resulting from the refactor, and flags residual issues.

---

## 2. What Was Moved

| Old Path | New Path | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `roles/` | `team/roles/` | All role directories moved under `team/` |
| `roles/conductor/reviews/` | `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/` | Conductor reviews moved to humans folder, date-bucketed |
| `docs/` | `library/docs/` | Documentation moved under `library/` |
| `docs/_to_process/` | `library/docs/_to_process/` | Spec originals moved with docs |
| `docs/specs/` | `library/docs/specs/` | Specs index moved with docs |

### New Directories Created

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `team/` | Top-level container for team structure |
| `team/roles/` | Role-based review and planning documents |
| `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/` | Conductor (human) briefs and reviews |
| `team/roles/appsec/` | New role: application security |
| `team/roles/historian/` | New role: decision tracking |
| `team/roles/journalist/` | New role: communications and content |

### New Role README Files

Each role now has a `README.md` defining its responsibilities.

---

## 3. Broken Links Found and Fixed

### 3.1 Files Fixed (17 files, 35+ individual link corrections)

| # | File | What Was Fixed |

## 4. Files NOT Modified (Intentional)

### 4.1 Historical Conductor Brief (2026-02-08)

`team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/2026-02-08/v0.1.0__review-on-dev-and-librarian-commits.md`

This file contains references to `roles/architect/v0.1.1/` and `roles/dev/briefs/` that were correct at the time of writing. Since this is a historical document authored by the Conductor before the refactor, modifying it would alter the historical record. These references are left as-is.

### 4.2 Generic Workflow Guide

`library/guides/agentic-setup/v0.1.0__guide__agentic-role-based-workflow.md`

Contains references to `roles/` as a generic pattern for any project using agentic workflows. These are not project-specific path references but general guidance. Left as-is.

### 4.3 v0.1.4 Review Files (Architect, Dev, DevOps, QA)

The four v0.1.4 review files under `team/roles/*/reviews/26-02-10/` contain no broken internal links. They reference source code paths (`sgraph_ai_app_send/`, `tests/unit/`) which were not affected by the refactor.

---

## 5. Issues Found

### 5.1 Residual `roles/` Directory at Root

An empty `roles/librarian/questions/` directory still exists at the repository root (`/roles/`). This appears to be a leftover from the move that was not fully cleaned up. It should be removed.

**Recommendation:** Delete `roles/` from the repo root.

### 5.2 No `docs/architecture/` Directory Exists Anywhere

The `.issues/README.md` previously linked to `../docs/architecture/` which never existed at `library/docs/architecture/`. The architecture documents were moved to `team/roles/architect/v0.1.1/` in an earlier reorganisation (v0.1.2). The navigation link has been updated accordingly.

### 5.3 No GRC Role Directory

`team/roles/librarian/reviews/v0.1.2__librarian-review.md` references `team/roles/grc/research/` as a destination for research docs. No `grc` role directory exists under `team/roles/`. The reference is from the v0.1.2 historical reorganisation table and describes what the Conductor intended at that time. This may need to be created or the reference updated if GRC research docs need a home.

### 5.4 MEMORY.md (Project Memory) Contains Stale Paths

The project memory file at `/root/.claude/projects/-home-user-SGraph-AI--App--Send/memory/MEMORY.md` references old paths:
- `docs/_to_process/` should be `library/docs/_to_process/`
- `docs/architecture/` should be `team/roles/architect/v0.1.1/`
- `docs/specs/README.md` should be `library/docs/specs/README.md`
- `docs/roadmap/phase-overview.md` should be `library/roadmap/phases/v0.1.1__phase-overview.md`

**Recommendation:** Update MEMORY.md to reflect current paths.
