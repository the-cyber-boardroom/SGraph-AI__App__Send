# Librarian Review: Explorer/Villager Session Setup

**Version:** v0.3.0
**Date:** 14 February 2026
**Role:** Librarian
**Brief:** `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/14/v0.3.2__daily-brief__sgraph-send-14-feb-2026.md`

---

## Summary

Reviewed the v0.3.2 daily brief and Wardley Maps team structure documents. Created the session infrastructure for the Explorer/Villager team split.

## Deliverables

### 1. Updated `.claude/CLAUDE.md`

Added to the root project guidance:

- **Team Structure section** — explains Explorer vs Villager, the 5 key separation rules, and links to role definitions
- **Session-specific instructions** — points to `.claude/explorer/CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/villager/CLAUDE.md`
- **Updated Role System** — expanded from "10 roles" to "17 roles across two teams" plus two meta-roles
- **Team-specific briefs note** — documented that daily briefs will now be team-specific
- **Updated Current State** — reflects v0.3.0 milestone and two parallel tracks
- **Updated Key Documents** — added Wardley Maps brief, Explorer/Villager role definitions, decisions document, and both daily briefs (v0.3.2 and v0.3.0)

### 2. Created `.claude/explorer/CLAUDE.md`

Explorer session file includes:
- Mission statement and Wardley stage context
- What Explorers DO and do NOT do (clear boundaries)
- Team composition (core, frequent, consulted, connected roles)
- Current Explorer priorities (from v0.3.2 brief task table)
- Wardley evolution map of components still being explored
- Four Explorer questions to always ask
- Handover protocol for when components are mature
- Full key references table
- Architecture context diagram

### 3. Created `.claude/villager/CLAUDE.md`

Villager session file includes:
- Mission statement and Wardley stage context
- **The One Rule** — prominently placed: no features, no functionality changes
- What Villagers DO (performance, scalability, hardening, docs, monitoring, testing, stability)
- What Villagers do NOT do (no features, no experiments, no exploration, no shortcutting handover)
- Team composition (core, frequent, consulted, connected roles)
- First Villager mission with component table and production release checklist (10 steps)
- Five Villager questions to always ask
- Distinct infrastructure requirements
- Communication protocol with Explorer team (receiving and sending)
- Full key references table
- Architecture context diagram
- Metrics the Villager team owns

### 4. Repo Structure

```
.claude/
  CLAUDE.md                    # Root — shared project rules + team structure overview
  explorer/CLAUDE.md           # Explorer team session instructions
  villager/CLAUDE.md           # Villager team session instructions
```

## How New Sessions Should Work

1. Human starts a new Claude Code Web session
2. In the first prompt, human indicates: "This is an **Explorer** session" or "This is a **Villager** session"
3. The agent reads `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (auto-loaded) for project-wide rules
4. The agent then reads `.claude/explorer/CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/villager/CLAUDE.md` for team-specific guidance
5. The agent operates within that team's boundaries for the entire session

## Notes for Future Updates

- When new briefs arrive (team-specific), update the "Current Priorities" section in the relevant session file
- The Wardley evolution map in the Explorer session should be updated as components mature
- When the first handover happens, create `team/roles/explorer/handovers/` folder
- If/when Town Planners team is introduced, create `.claude/town-planners/CLAUDE.md`
