# v0.3.2 -- Master Index: Explorer Action Plans (14 Feb 2026)

**Version:** v0.3.2
**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Role:** Librarian
**Briefs indexed:** 4 (v0.3.2 daily brief + 3 supporting documents)
**Previous index:** [`v0.3.0__master-index__daily-brief-responses-14-feb.md`](v0.3.0__master-index__daily-brief-responses-14-feb.md)

## Read This First

The v0.3.2 briefs mark the most significant structural change in the project since inception: the introduction of the **Explorer/Villager team split** based on Wardley Maps methodology. The end-to-end MVP is proven. Real users have completed the full file-sharing flow. The project now divides into two parallel tracks -- Explorers continue discovering and building new features, while Villagers take the proven components and productise them for a stable release.

Four briefs were issued simultaneously. This index catalogues them, maps them to roles, recommends a reading order, and captures the new decisions.

## 1. Document Catalogue

### 1.1 The Four v0.3.2 Briefs

| # | Document | Path | Summary |
|---|----------|------|---------|
| **B1** | Daily Brief (v0.3.2) | [`v0.3.2__daily-brief__sgraph-send-14-feb-2026.md`](../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/14/v0.3.2__daily-brief__sgraph-send-14-feb-2026.md) | Central brief. MVP confirmed working end-to-end. User feedback: "why not WeTransfer?" and large-file sweet spot identified. Six workstreams launched: IFD production release (P1), design agency brief (P1), Issues FS adoption (P1), large file transfer roadmap (P2), external partner bot research (P2), landing page positioning (P2). Explorer/Villager team structure introduced. 11 tasks assigned across roles. |
| **B2** | Wardley Maps Context | [`v0.3.2__briefs__wardley-maps-in-sgraph-project.md`](../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/14/v0.3.2__briefs__wardley-maps-in-sgraph-project.md) | Deep explanation of Wardley Maps applied to SGraph Send. Evolution map of 13 components (5 at custom-built ready for productisation, 8 at genesis still being explored). Defines the Explorer-to-Villager "theft" handover mechanism. Two teams created (Explorer, Villager); Town Planners explicitly deferred. Role distribution table across teams. Cartographer identified as the connective tissue between teams. IFD connection: Explorers create minor versions, Villagers create major releases. |
| **B3** | Explorer Role Definition | [`v0.3.2__role-definition__explorer.md`](../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/14/v0.3.2__role-definition__explorer.md) | Meta-role definition for Explorer team leader. Owns the exploration frontier, manages minor versions, writes handover briefs, captures knowledge. Team composition defined (4 core, 4 frequent, 5 consulted, 3 always-connected). Relationship with Cartographer formalised. Clear "does NOT do" boundaries: no production, no performance optimisation, no releases. Metrics: pace of discovery, handover brief quality, failed experiment ratio, maturity progression. |
| **B4** | Villager Role Definition | [`v0.3.2__role-definition__villager.md`](../../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/14/v0.3.2__role-definition__villager.md) | Meta-role definition for Villager team leader. Owns the productisation pipeline, creates IFD releases, manages distinct production infrastructure. The One Rule: NO feature changes. Focus: performance, scalability, deployment, documentation, monitoring, testing, stability. Team composition defined (4 core, 4 frequent, 3 consulted, 3 always-connected). First Villager mission: productise the 5 MVP components (encryption, upload/download, S3, tokens, link sharing). Metrics: release cadence, production stability, feature creep incidents, time to productise. |

### 1.2 Session Deliverables Responding to v0.3.2 Briefs

| Role | File | Key Takeaway |
|------|------|--------------|
| **Librarian** | [`v0.3.0__review__explorer-villager-session-setup.md`](v0.3.0__review__explorer-villager-session-setup.md) | Created `.claude/explorer/CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/villager/CLAUDE.md` session files. Updated root `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with team structure. Defined how new sessions should work (human declares team, agent reads team-specific guidance). |
| **Architect** | [`v0.3.0__review__next-steps-from-wardley-briefs.md`](../../architect/reviews/26-02-14/v0.3.0__review__next-steps-from-wardley-briefs.md) | 10 Explorer actions (E1-E10) and 10 Villager actions (V1-V10) defined. 4 architectural decisions proposed: AD-1 (environment separation -- recommends same account, separate resources), AD-2 (handover brief format), AD-3 (branching strategy -- recommends release branches), AD-4 (large file transfer architecture). Evolution map visualised with handover zone. Critical path identified: Explorer handover brief, production environment, design agency brief. |
| **Librarian** | [`v0.3.2__master-index__explorer-action-plans.md`](v0.3.2__master-index__explorer-action-plans.md) | **This file.** Complete catalogue of v0.3.2 briefs, role-to-brief mapping, reading order, cross-references, decision register, and delta from v0.3.0. |

## 2. Role-to-Brief Mapping

This table shows which roles should read which briefs, based on the task assignments in the daily brief (B1) and the team composition defined in B3 (Explorer) and B4 (Villager).

### 2.1 Explorer Team Roles

| Role | B1 (Daily Brief) | B2 (Wardley Maps) | B3 (Explorer Def.) | B4 (Villager Def.) | Rationale |
|------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|-----------|
| **Conductor** | MUST | MUST | MUST | MUST | Orchestrates both teams, manages handovers, owns IFD release coordination. P1 tasks: IFD release, Issues FS adoption. Needs full context of both team structures. |
| **Architect** | MUST | MUST | MUST | SHOULD | P1: design agency brief (supporting). P2: large file transfer roadmap, external partner bot research, Slack/WhatsApp research. P3: unencrypted mode evaluation. 4 architectural decisions pending (AD-1 to AD-4). |
| **Designer** | MUST | SKIM | SHOULD | SKIM | P1: design agency brief (owner), kickoff presentation (owner). P2: landing page "why not WeTransfer?" positioning. Must understand exploration context but doesn't need deep Wardley theory. |
| **Dev** | MUST | SKIM | SHOULD | SKIM | P1: IFD production release preparation. Needs to understand Explorer boundaries (what to build) vs Villager (what to harden). |
| **AppSec** | MUST | SKIM | SHOULD | SHOULD | P3: unencrypted mode security implications. Needs both team contexts because AppSec operates across Explorer (code review) and Villager (production hardening). |
| **Advocate** | MUST | SKIM | SHOULD | SKIM | P1: design agency brief (user persona input), kickoff presentation. P2: "why not WeTransfer?" user perspective. P3: unencrypted mode user review. User feedback is the trigger for several workstreams. |
| **Journalist** | MUST | SKIM | SHOULD | -- | P2: landing page positioning copy. Must understand the "why not WeTransfer?" feedback. |
| **Sherpa** | MUST | SKIM | SHOULD | -- | P3: read receipts and multi-upload roadmap items. Trail data informs UX features. |
| **Librarian** | MUST | MUST | MUST | MUST | Catalogues work from both teams. Must maintain indexes across both tracks. This role operates across both teams. |
| **Historian** | MUST | MUST | MUST | MUST | Must record the team split as a structural milestone. Tracks the evolution -- what moved from Explorer to Villager and when. Operates across both teams. |
| **Cartographer** | MUST | MUST | MUST | MUST | Central to the entire Wardley Maps structure. Maintains the evolution map, visualises the handover pipeline, tracks movement along the evolution axis. Explicitly identified as connective tissue between teams. |
| **Ambassador** | MUST | SKIM | SHOULD | -- | P1: design agency kickoff presentation (positioning). P2: "why not WeTransfer?" market positioning. Needs to define the competitive landscape for the design agency brief. |

### 2.2 Villager Team Roles (for context)

These roles are primarily Villager but should read the v0.3.2 briefs for awareness of the new structure:

| Role | B1 (Daily Brief) | B2 (Wardley Maps) | B3 (Explorer Def.) | B4 (Villager Def.) | Rationale |
|------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|-----------|
| **DevOps** | MUST | SHOULD | SKIM | MUST | V2-V3: production AWS environment, deployment pipeline. V6: monitoring. V10: rollback procedures. Needs Villager definition deeply. |
| **QA** | MUST | SHOULD | SKIM | MUST | V4: performance testing. V7: regression suite. V9: smoke tests. Needs to understand Villager test mandate. |
| **GRC** | SHOULD | SHOULD | SKIM | MUST | Production compliance verification. Primarily Villager. |
| **DPO** | SHOULD | SHOULD | SKIM | MUST | Data protection verification for production systems. Primarily Villager. |
| **CISO** | SHOULD | SHOULD | SHOULD | MUST | Security review for both exploration and production. V5: security hardening review. |

**Legend:** MUST = required reading, primary assignment depends on it. SHOULD = recommended, provides important context. SKIM = awareness-level, read the summary and relevant sections. -- = not required.

## 5. Decision Register Update

### 5.1 New Structural Decisions (v0.3.2)

| ID | Decision | Made By | Status | Reference | Impact |
|----|----------|---------|--------|-----------|--------|
| D038 | **Explorer/Villager team split adopted.** Project now operates as two teams based on Wardley Maps methodology. Two meta-roles (Explorer, Villager) created to lead each team. | Dinis Cruz | APPROVED | B1 (section "Wardley Maps"), B2, B3, B4 | Fundamental structural change. All roles now have Explorer-mode and Villager-mode behaviours. Session files created. |
| D039 | **Town Planners team explicitly deferred.** Third Wardley team type will not be introduced until components reach commodity stage. | Dinis Cruz | APPROVED | B2 (section "Two Teams, Not Three") | Prevents premature scaling of team structure. |
| D040 | **Cartographer identified as connective tissue between teams.** Cartographer maintains the Wardley evolution map, tracks component maturity, visualises the handover pipeline. | Dinis Cruz | APPROVED | B2 (section "The Cartographer's Special Role") | Elevates the Cartographer to a structurally critical role in the new team topology. |
| D041 | **Villagers do NOT add features, fix bugs that change behaviour, or modify functionality.** The One Rule is non-negotiable. Bugs that require behaviour changes go back to Explorer. | Dinis Cruz | APPROVED | B4 (section "The One Rule"), B2 | Enforces clean separation between exploration and productisation. Prevents version drift. |
| D042 | **Distinct infrastructure required.** Explorer and Villager teams operate in separate AWS environments, separate pipelines, separate branches. | Dinis Cruz | APPROVED | B2 (section "Distinct Environments"), B4 | Architect proposed AD-1 (same account, separate resources) as implementation approach. Decision pending from Dinis/DevOps. |

### 5.2 New Feature/Product Decisions (v0.3.2)

| ID | Decision | Made By | Status | Reference | Impact |
|----|----------|---------|--------|-----------|--------|
| D043 | **Design agency engagement.** External design company coming on board. Designer role owns the brief and kickoff presentation. | Dinis Cruz | APPROVED | B1 (section "Design Agency Brief") | First external stakeholder. Creates new collaboration pattern. Time-sensitive -- agency waiting. |
| D044 | **Issues FS adoption starts now.** Every active workstream gets a `.issues` file. All roles update issue status as they work. | Dinis Cruz | APPROVED | B1 (section "Issues FS: Start Using It") | Changes task tracking methodology across the project. |
| D045 | **Large file transfer identified as the sweet spot.** User feedback: 1GB+ files are where real unmet need lives. Added to roadmap as P2. | Dinis Cruz | APPROVED | B1 (section "The Big File Sweet Spot") | Shapes product direction. Architecture should support chunked uploads, retry, checksum from the start. |
| D046 | **"Why not WeTransfer?" must be answered in first 10 seconds.** Landing page must address competitive positioning head-on. | Dinis Cruz | APPROVED | B1 (section "Why are we reinventing WeTransfer?") | Drives Designer, Journalist, Advocate, Ambassador work on landing page. |
| D047 | **Unencrypted mode under evaluation.** Default always encrypted, but explicit opt-out for large non-sensitive files being considered. Pluggable, not fundamental. | Dinis Cruz | UNDER REVIEW | B1 (section "Unencrypted Mode") | P3. Requires Advocate (user perspective), AppSec (security implications), Architect (architecture impact) review before decision. |
| D048 | **Read receipts and multi-upload captured for roadmap.** Not urgent, but natural extensions. | Dinis Cruz | CAPTURED | B1 (section "Read Receipts and Multi-Upload") | P3. Architect to add to roadmap. Sherpa to inform via trail data. |

### 5.3 Architectural Decisions Proposed (Pending Human Approval)

These were proposed by the Architect in the next-steps review. They are not yet approved.

| ID | Decision | Proposed By | Status | Reference |
|----|----------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| AD-1 | Environment separation: same AWS account, separate resources with naming conventions | Architect | PROPOSED | Architect next-steps review |
| AD-2 | Handover brief format: standardised 7-section template at `team/roles/explorer/handovers/` | Architect | PROPOSED | Architect next-steps review |
| AD-3 | Branching strategy: Explorer on `dev`, Villager on `release/*` branches | Architect | PROPOSED | Architect next-steps review |
| AD-4 | Large file transfer: client-side chunking, S3 multipart upload, per-chunk retry, SHA-256 checksum | Architect | PROPOSED | Architect next-steps review |

### 5.4 Decision Register Summary

| Range | Count | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| D014-D037 | 24 | From v0.3.0 and earlier (see previous master index) |
| D038-D048 | 11 | New in v0.3.2 (this index) |
| AD-1 to AD-4 | 4 | Proposed, pending approval |

*This master index supersedes the v0.3.0 master index for current project state. For the v0.3.0 session context (admin UI delivery, decision register D014-D037, risk register RF-01 to RF-32), refer to [`v0.3.0__master-index__daily-brief-responses-14-feb.md`](v0.3.0__master-index__daily-brief-responses-14-feb.md). The highest priority next actions are: (1) Explorer writes handover brief for MVP components, (2) Villager sets up production environment, (3) Designer starts the design agency brief. These three workstreams can run in parallel across the two team sessions.*
