# v0.3.0 -- Master Index: Role Responses to Daily Brief (14 Feb 2026)

**Version:** v0.3.0
**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Role:** Librarian
**Brief:** `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/14/v0.3.0__daily-brief__sgraph-send-14-feb-2026.md`
**Previous index:** `team/roles/librarian/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.24__master-index__daily-brief-responses-13-feb.md`

## Read This First

The v0.3.0 daily brief marks a milestone: the version bump from v0.2.41 to v0.3.0 captures two days of intense work (13-14 February) that transformed SGraph Send from a minimal encrypted file sharing MVP into a multi-Lambda, cache-backed, token-managed platform.

**The central directive for v0.3.0 is: build the admin UI.** The backend is complete -- 5 token endpoints, 1 analytics pulse endpoint, analytics middleware, inter-Lambda communication via Service Registry. The admin UI at `sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__admin/v0/v0.1/v0.1.0/index.html` is a placeholder. All 14 roles received directives; this index catalogues the responses produced in this session.

Full data flow diagrams for token validation, transfer create, analytics recording. Admin UI component topology proposed. Storage namespace map documented. Security boundary map updated. 8 changes tracked from v0.2.24 state. |
| **Librarian** | [`v0.3.0__master-index__daily-brief-responses-14-feb.md`](../../librarian/reviews/26-02-14/v0.3.0__master-index__daily-brief-responses-14-feb.md) | **This file.** Complete index of v0.3.0 session documents, cross-references, decision register, risk register, document chain. |

### 1.2 Documents from Earlier 14 Feb Sessions (Pre-v0.3.0 Brief)

These were produced in response to the v0.2.41 brief (`team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/14/v0.2.41__brief__decisions-14-feb-2026.md`) and remain relevant context:

| Role | File | Key Takeaway |
|------|------|--------------|
| **Dev** | [`v0.2.41__review__ifd-broken-independence-analysis.md`](../../dev/reviews/26-02-14/v0.2.41__review__ifd-broken-independence-analysis.md) | Root cause analysis: v0.1.x UI versions are full class copies, not surgical overrides. Decision: accept current state, fix at v0.2.0 consolidation. |
| **Dev** | [`v0.2.41__review__osbot-capabilities-and-cache-service-audit.md`](../../dev/reviews/26-02-14/v0.2.41__review__osbot-capabilities-and-cache-service-audit.md) | Complete catalogue of every osbot-* feature used by SGraph Send. Identified existing cache service reduces implementation from 25-35h to 8-12h. |

*This master index should be read first for any v0.3.0 session context. For the 13 Feb session, refer to the previous master index at `team/roles/librarian/reviews/26-02-13/v0.2.24__master-index__daily-brief-responses-13-feb.md`. The highest priority pending item is the Architect response, which unblocks the Dev implementation of admin UI v0.1.0.*
