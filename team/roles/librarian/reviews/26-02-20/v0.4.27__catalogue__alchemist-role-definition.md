## Summary

The **Alchemist** role has been created as a new team role (role #18). The Alchemist owns investor relations -- transmuting the team's technical output into investor-grade materials, managing patron relationships, and owning the funding pipeline.

The role was created from a human brief that provided the full conceptual framework, historical metaphor, and day-to-day responsibilities.

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Separate from Ambassador | Ambassador = broad (world), Alchemist = narrow (investors). Different audiences, different stakes, different outputs. |
| Follows established ROLE.md pattern | Same structure as Ambassador, Sherpa, etc. for consistency. |
| Consumes from all technical roles | Architect, Dev, DevOps, AppSec, QA -- all feed into investor materials. |
| Owns B0-B10 priority queue | Business priorities flow through the Alchemist to the Conductor. |
| "The gold is real" principle | Explicit acknowledgement that the Alchemist translates, never fabricates. |
