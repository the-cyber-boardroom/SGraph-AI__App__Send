## New Briefs Catalogued

### 1. Developer Brief: Admin PKI Key Management Page

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Document | [`v0.4.20__dev-brief__admin-pki-key-management-page.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/20/v0.4.20__dev-brief__admin-pki-key-management-page.md) |
| Version | v0.4.20 |
| Team | Developer (lead), Designer |
| Classification | B3 as B1 / D1 |
| Status | **ACTIONED** — PKI page built as v0.1.2 admin UI overlay |
| Key Content | Detailed build spec for `/admin/pki.html`. Standalone page using Web Crypto API and IndexedDB. RSA-OAEP 4096-bit key generation with non-extractable private keys. Hybrid encryption (RSA wraps AES-256-GCM). PEM export/import. Contacts store. 6 workflows, 13 acceptance criteria. |

### 2. AppSec Research: Service Worker Trust Anchor

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Document | [`v0.4.20__appsec-research__service-worker-trust-anchor.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/20/v0.4.20__appsec-research__service-worker-trust-anchor.md) |
| Version | v0.4.20 |
| Team | AppSec (lead), Architect, Developer, GRC |
| Classification | Security architecture research — novel approach |
| Status | **CATALOGUED** — no action taken yet |
| Key Content | Novel security architecture using Service Workers as client-side trust anchors independent of the CA system. Three layers: code integrity (hash pinning), content authenticity (Ed25519 signed responses), source restriction (trust registry). TOFU model with physical trust anchor mitigations (business card QR codes, multi-path verification). Five-phase implementation roadmap from MVP code pinning through browser-native support. Comparison table against TLS, HSTS, certificate pinning, SRI. Research questions for AppSec role. Potentially publishable as IETF draft or research paper. |

## Team Responses Produced (This Session)

| Document | Role | Key Content |
|----------|------|-------------|
| PKI page (v0.1.2) | Developer | Implemented the dev brief: `pki.html`, `pki-manager.js` Web Component, updated admin-shell with Security nav section. Full key generation, storage, import/export, hybrid encrypt/decrypt test, browser capability detection. |
| [v0.4.17 research outputs](v0.4.17__investor-proposal-and-pki-research.md) | Architect, Ambassador | PKI+mTLS implementation plan, LLM integration plan (CLI + MCP), investor proposal. All "SigSend" references corrected to "SG/Send". |

## Cross-References

- **PKI page implements concepts from:** Service Worker trust anchor research (Layer 5: Web Crypto PKI)
- **PKI page precedes:** PKI integration with main send/receive flow, Claude skill integration
- **Service Worker research extends:** Existing zero-knowledge architecture (adds integrity and authenticity layers above confidentiality)
- **Naming decision:** Written brand name is "SG/Send". CLI package name is `sg_send`. Spoken form is "sig send" (informal only).
