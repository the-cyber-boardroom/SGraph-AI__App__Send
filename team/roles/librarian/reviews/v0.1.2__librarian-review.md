# v0.1.2 — Librarian Review

**Version:** v0.1.2
**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Role:** Librarian
**In response to:** Conductor review v0.1.0

---

## 1. Repo Reorganisation Acknowledged

The Conductor has reorganised the repo significantly in v0.1.2:

| Old Location | New Location | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| `docs/architecture/` | `team/roles/architect/v0.1.1/` | Versioned under architect role |
| `docs/library/` | `library/dependencies/` + `library/guides/` | Split into dependencies and guides |
| `docs/roadmap/` | `library/roadmap/phases/` | Prefixed with v0.1.1 |
| `docs/research/` | `team/roles/grc/research/` | Under GRC role |

This structure is cleaner — each role has its own output folder, library docs are separated from project-specific docs, and everything is versioned. I'll follow this pattern going forward.

## 2. File Naming Convention

**Action taken:** All files created in this review follow the `v0.1.2__` prefix convention, reading from `sgraph_ai_app_send/version`.

## 3. Issues FS Config Updates

### 3.1 Node Types Added

Per the Conductor's note that we should add `phase` as a node type, I've updated `.issues/config/node-types.json` to add:

- **`phase`** — sits between project and feature in the hierarchy (statuses: proposed, active, completed, deferred)
- **`project`** — top-level project container (statuses: active, on-hold, completed, archived)
- **`research`** — for research briefs/spikes (statuses: proposed, in-progress, completed, archived)
- **`spike`** — time-boxed investigation (statuses: proposed, in-progress, completed)

### 3.2 Issues FS CLI

The Conductor noted issues-fs-cli is in pyproject.toml. I'll use it for future issue management instead of manual JSON creation.

## 4. Register Interest — Moved to External Platform

Per the Conductor's decision, the Register Interest feature (previously Feature-6 Tasks 4-5) is removed from the MVP scope. A research task has been added to investigate suitable external platforms (e.g., Mailchimp, ConvertKit, Buttondown, or a simple Google Form).

**Impact on Issues FS:**
- Feature-6 Task-4 (`POST /register-interest`) → status changed to `deferred`, note added
- Feature-6 Task-5 (register-interest page) → status changed to `deferred`, note added
- New research task added: "Research external mailing list platform"

## 5. Knowledge Base Status

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Spec documents (6) | `library/docs/_to_process/` | Unchanged, still the source of truth |
| Phase 1 Issues FS tree | `.issues/` | 8 features, 39 tasks (2 deferred per register-interest decision) |
| Architecture docs | `team/roles/architect/v0.1.1/` + `team/roles/architect/v0.1.2/` | v0.1.1 preserved, v0.1.2 revisions produced |
| Library docs | `library/` | Substantial new dependency and guide docs added by Conductor |
| Roadmap | `library/roadmap/phases/` | Phase overview and issue overview moved here |

## 6. New Library Documentation Inventory

The Conductor added extensive dependency documentation. Here's the inventory for reference:

| Library | Key Docs | Relevance to SGraph Send |
|---------|----------|-------------------------|
| **osbot-utils / Type_Safe** | 5 docs (type_safe, decorators, collections, testing, primitives) | Core: all code uses Type_Safe |
| **osbot-utils / features** | 3 docs (files, json, temp utilities) | Core: file and JSON operations |
| **osbot-fast-api** | 1 doc (routes development guide) | Core: all API routes |
| **osbot-aws** | 3 docs (overview, lambda, s3) | Core: all AWS operations |
| **memory-fs** | 2 docs (abstraction layer, architecture) | Core: storage abstraction |
| **issues-fs** | 3 docs (user guide, manual workflow, architecture) | Supporting: project management |
| **IFD** | 5 docs (intro, testing, versioning) + 5 docs (issues-fs UI) | Core: frontend methodology |
| **Python formatting** | 1 doc | Core: code style |
| **Testing patterns** | 2 docs (type_safe testing, cache service testing) | Core: test approach |

**Total: ~30 library/guide documents** providing the patterns and conventions for all development.
