# v0.4.4 -- Master Index: Daily Brief 16 February 2026

**Version:** v0.4.4
**Date:** 2026-02-16

## Read This First

The v0.4.4 daily brief marks a significant strategic shift. The project has moved from v0.3.0 (end-to-end MVP, admin UI priority) to v0.4.4 with a new vision: **SG/Send as an encrypted workflow platform, not just a file transfer tool.** The version jump from v0.3.0 to v0.4.4 reflects multiple iterations (v0.3.x through v0.4.x) of work between 14 Feb and 16 Feb, including Explorer and Villager sessions on 15 Feb.

The human has provided **6 documents** and a **design-brief subfolder** (3 additional documents) on 16 Feb 2026. The briefs are now team-specific: separate Explorer and Villager daily briefs. This index catalogues all of them.

**Key new concepts introduced in v0.4.4:**
1. **Interactive encrypted data workflows** -- JSON in / JSON out with dynamic UIs, all client-side encrypted
2. **Briefing packs for agents** -- curated context packages for parallel agent execution
3. **Translator role** -- first Villager-exclusive role (language + audience translation)
4. **DPO/AppSec/GRC evidence pack** -- collecting real evidence of security/privacy role value
5. **Daily memo workflow process** -- formalised intake pipeline for human briefs

## 1. Documents Catalogued (16 Feb 2026)

### 1.1 Daily Briefs

| Document | Version | Team | Key Takeaway |
|----------|---------|------|--------------|
| [`v0.4.4__daily-brief__explorer-team-16-feb-2026.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/16/v0.4.4__daily-brief__explorer-team-16-feb-2026.md) | v0.4.4 | Explorer | 5 new concepts: interactive encrypted workflows, briefing packs, Translator role awareness, DPO/AppSec/GRC evidence pack, daily memo workflow process. Yesterday's priorities (UX bugs, SA dashboard, upload/download resilience) remain active. |
| [`v0.4.4__daily-brief__villager-team-16-feb-2026.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/16/v0.4.4__daily-brief__villager-team-16-feb-2026.md) | v0.4.4 | Villager | Production environment setup (dev/QA/prod subdomains), CloudFront LETS pipeline in detail, user acquisition beta programme, Translator role definition, admin UI SA visualisation, daily automated reports. |

### 1.2 Role Definitions

| Document | Version | Team | Key Takeaway |
|----------|---------|------|--------------|
| [`v0.4.3__role-definition__translator.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/16/v0.4.3__role-definition__translator.md) | v0.4.3 | Villager (exclusive) | First Villager-exclusive role. Handles language translation (en, pt-BR, pt-PT, Klingon) AND audience translation (developer, business, end-user personas). Three-phase evolution: internal translation, market entry scaling, customer-facing translation product with P&L. Human reviewer step is non-negotiable. Uses SG/Send for reviewer workflow (dogfooding). Corporate translation profiles for enterprise customers. Non-English market hypothesis as growth strategy. |

### 1.3 Exploration Briefs

| Document | Version | Team | Key Takeaway |
|----------|---------|------|--------------|
| [`v0.4.4__explorer-brief__interactive-encrypted-data-workflows.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/16/v0.4.4__explorer-brief__interactive-encrypted-data-workflows.md) | v0.4.4 | Explorer | Major new exploration: JSON data with UI schemas, encrypted round-trip, dynamic interactive UIs rendered client-side. Three use cases: (1) translation review workflow, (2) client-side translation as product feature, (3) general-purpose encrypted workflows (approval, survey, code review, data collection). UI component library of 13 component types defined. LLM-generated UI schemas proposed. Security model: schemas must be declarative, never executable; renderer must be sandboxed. |

### 1.4 Process Briefs

| Document | Version | Team | Key Takeaway |
|----------|---------|------|--------------|
| [`v0.4.4__briefs__briefing-packs-for-agents.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/16/v0.4.4__briefs__briefing-packs-for-agents.md) | v0.4.4 | All | Curated context packages for agent execution. Iron rule: one folder per pack (no exceptions). Minimum viable pack: BRIEF.md + .issues/tasks.issues. Four sizes (bug, task, iteration, workstream) x three access levels (full repo, packaged repo, no repo). Method streams principle: quote actual code with file paths and line numbers, never descriptions. Reference summaries library (caching service, LETS, IFD, etc.). First pack: CloudFront log pipeline. |
| [`v0.4.4__briefs__dpo-appsec-grc-evidence-pack.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/16/v0.4.4__briefs__dpo-appsec-grc-evidence-pack.md) | v0.4.4 | All (Librarian, Historian, Journalist lead) | Evidence collection for publication: 11 known examples of DPO/AppSec/GRC influence on project decisions. Three phases: (1) evidence collection (Librarian + Historian), (2) interviews with impacted roles (Journalist), (3) two articles -- technical report (Historian) and narrative article (Journalist). Runs in parallel with engineering work. |

### 1.5 Design Brief Subfolder

| Document | Version | Team | Key Takeaway |
|----------|---------|------|--------------|
| [`design-brief/v0_3_5__designer__sg-send-design-guidelines.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/16/design-brief/v0_3_5__designer__sg-send-design-guidelines.md) | v0.3.5 | Explorer | Full brand identity guidelines. "SG/Send" adopted as brand shorthand (D051). Product family system (SG/ prefix). The slash is the key brand element. |
| [`design-brief/v0_3_5__designer__sg-send-logo-brief.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/16/design-brief/v0_3_5__designer__sg-send-logo-brief.md) | v0.3.5 | Explorer | Logo generation brief. Purely typographic, slash is the hero, minimal, geometric, modern. |
| [`design-brief/v0_3_5__designer__sg-send-logo-brief-for-chatgpt.md`](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/02/16/design-brief/v0_3_5__designer__sg-send-logo-brief-for-chatgpt.md) | v0.3.5 | Explorer | ChatGPT-specific logo generation prompt. Same design direction, packaged for image generation. |
