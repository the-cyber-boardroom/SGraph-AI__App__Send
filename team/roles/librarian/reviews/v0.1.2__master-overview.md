# v0.1.2 — Librarian / Architect / Cartographer Review

**Version:** v0.1.2
**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Author:** Claude (Librarian, Architect, Cartographer)
**In response to:** [Conductor review v0.1.0](../../../humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/2026-02-08/v0.1.0__review-on-dev-and-librarian-commits.md)

## Summary

This document is the master index for all v0.1.2 outputs from the Librarian, Architect, and Cartographer roles. It was produced in response to the Conductor's review of v0.1.0/v0.1.1 work, which made significant architectural decisions that reshape the implementation approach.

## Key Decisions Incorporated

These are the Conductor decisions from the v0.1.0 review that are now reflected in all revised plans:

| # | Decision | Impact |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Memory-FS as storage abstraction | Entire storage layer redesigned — no direct S3 calls |
| 2 | Two Lambda functions (public + admin) | Separate security boundaries, simplified auth |
| 3 | Lambda URL Functions (no API Gateway) | Simplified deployment, cost reduction |
| 4 | OSBot-Fast-API for all routing | Routes as classes, built-in auth, CORS handled |
| 5 | Type_Safe everywhere (never Pydantic) | All schemas follow Schema__App__Send__* pattern |
| 6 | No mocks in tests | Full in-memory stack, ~100ms startup |
| 7 | Events as individual files | One file per event in events/ folder |
| 8 | File storage = observability | Every action logged as a file in transfer folder |
| 9 | No /api/v1/ prefix | Python client API provides versioning abstraction later |
| 10 | IFD + Web Components for frontend | No frameworks, surgical override versioning |
| 11 | Three UIs (user, tools, admin) | Separate concerns, separate deployment |
| 12 | Register Interest → external platform | Removed from scope, research task added |
| 13 | osbot-aws only (never boto3) | All AWS operations via osbot-aws wrappers |
| 14 | Endpoints for file save/retrieve | Server handles storage (not just pre-signed URLs) |
| 15 | Timestamps as ints (Timestamp_Now) | Consistent across all schemas |
| 16 | IDs via Obj_Id / Transfer_Id | With .new() helper for random generation |

## What Changed From v0.1.1

| Area | v0.1.1 | v0.1.2 |
|------|--------|--------|
| Storage | S3 directly | Memory-FS abstraction (in-memory, disk, zip, sqlite, S3) |
| File transfer | Pre-signed URLs only | Endpoints for save/retrieve + pre-signed URLs (deployment-dependent) |
| Lambda count | 1 | 2 (public + admin) |
| API Gateway | Required | Not needed (Lambda URL Functions) |
| Schemas | Pydantic | Type_Safe |
| Testing | Mocks (moto) | Full in-memory stack, no mocks |
| Events storage | events.json | events/ folder, one file per event |
| Frontend | Vanilla JS, hash routing | IFD + Web Components, SPA routing |
| UI count | 1 site (6 pages) | 3 sites (user workflow, user tools, admin) |
| Register Interest | Custom endpoint | External platform (research task) |
| Base path | /api/v1/ | No prefix |
| Data model | In FastAPI plan | Separate document |
