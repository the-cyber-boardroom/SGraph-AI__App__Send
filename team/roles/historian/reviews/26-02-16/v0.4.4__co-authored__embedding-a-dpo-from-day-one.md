# v0.4.4 -- Co-Authored Article: Embedding a DPO From Day One

**Version:** v0.4.4
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Role:** Historian (co-author with Journalist)
**Type:** Co-authored feature article for external audience

## Historian's Contribution

This document records the Historian's contribution to the co-authored article on DPO evidence.

**Primary document:** `team/roles/journalist/reviews/26-02-16/v0.4.4__article__embedding-a-dpo-from-day-one.md`

### What the Historian Provided

1. **Evidence verification.** Each of the 10 DPO interventions was verified against source documents. Quotes were confirmed against the original files. Dates and version numbers were cross-referenced.

2. **Counterfactual assessments.** The "what would have happened without the DPO" analysis for each intervention draws on the Historian's record of the project's decision-making patterns. The assessment that DevOps would have selected all CloudFront fields by default, for example, is based on the observed pattern of "maximum observability" in the project's infrastructure decisions.

3. **Confidence levels.** The HIGH / MEDIUM-HIGH / MEDIUM classification reflects the Historian's honest assessment of evidentiary strength. HIGH-confidence items have explicit documentation, clear causation, and verifiable counterfactuals. MEDIUM items have real DPO influence but shared credit or incomplete outcomes.

4. **Timeline reconstruction.** The 9-day timeline (8--16 February 2026) and the sequencing of interventions draws on the Historian's milestone records and decision log.

### What the Article Did NOT Claim

The Historian ensured the article does not:

- Attribute the zero-knowledge architecture solely to the DPO (it was the human stakeholder's vision)
- Claim that any intervention prevented a confirmed breach (they prevented conditions that could lead to breaches)
- Inflate medium-confidence items to high confidence
- Omit the DPO's acknowledged failures (open actions, missing privacy policy)
