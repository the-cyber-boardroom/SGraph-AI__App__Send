## 1. Milestone Record

### M010: v0.3.0 -- First Minor Version Bump (Platform Foundation Complete)

**Date:** 14 February 2026
**Version range:** v0.2.24 to v0.3.0
**Duration:** 2 calendar days (13-14 February 2026)

**Significance:** The version was bumped from v0.2.41 to v0.3.0, marking the completion of the foundational sprint. This is the first time the project has incremented its minor version number. All previous work (v0.1.x through v0.2.x) is now considered foundational infrastructure. v0.3.0 signals the transition from "building the platform" to "building on the platform."

**What the v0.3.0 milestone represents:**

| Capability | State at v0.2.24 (start of sprint) | State at v0.3.0 (end of sprint) |
|------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Lambda architecture | Single Lambda (user) | Two Lambdas (user + admin) with inter-Lambda communication |
| Token management | No token system | Full CRUD: create, lookup, use, revoke, list |
| Analytics | Google Analytics (third-party) | Server-side analytics via cache service (zero third-party) |
| Storage | Direct Memory-FS | Cache service abstraction (KEY_BASED + TEMPORAL strategies) |
| UI versions | v0.1.0 only | v0.1.0, v0.1.1, v0.1.2, v0.1.3, v0.1.4 shipped |
| Languages | English only | 4 languages (English, PT-BR, PT-PT, Klingon) |
| Roles active | 10 of 14 | 14 of 14 (all activated) |
| Decision log | D001-D013 | D001-D034+ |
| Public presence | Domain live, no content | LinkedIn post, 4-language showcase |
| Admin UI | No UI | Placeholder ready, backend complete, architecture designed |

**Why this matters for the historical record:**
- v0.3.0 is the first version that has a fully operational backend for both user-facing and admin operations
- The version bump from v0.2.x to v0.3.0 is an explicit signal from the project lead that the foundational sprint is complete
- Everything after v0.3.0 is building on proven infrastructure, not creating it

### M011: All 14 Roles Activated

**Date:** 14 February 2026
**Significance:** All 14 agentic roles have now produced at least one deliverable. The team is fully operational.

**Role activation timeline (complete):**

| Role | Defined | First Output | Dormancy | Total Deliverables (est.) |
|------|---------|-------------|----------|---------------------------|
| Conductor | Pre-v0.1.4 | 08 Feb | 0 days | 5+ sprint plans |
| Architect | Pre-v0.1.4 | 08 Feb | 0 days | 12+ reviews |
| Dev | Pre-v0.1.4 | 08 Feb | 0 days | 10+ implementations |
| QA | Pre-v0.1.4 | 08 Feb | 0 days | 5+ test plans |
| DevOps | Pre-v0.1.4 | 08 Feb | 0 days | 5+ infrastructure reviews |
| Librarian | Pre-v0.1.4 | 08 Feb | 0 days | 8+ indices/catalogues |
| Cartographer | Pre-v0.1.4 | 08 Feb | 0 days | 4+ system maps |
| AppSec | Pre-v0.1.4 | 08 Feb | 0 days | 8+ security reviews |
| Historian | Pre-v0.1.4 | 08 Feb | 0 days | 7+ milestone records |
| Journalist | Pre-v0.1.4 | 08 Feb | 0 days | 3+ content pieces |
| DPO | 12 Feb | 13 Feb | 1 day | 2+ compliance reviews |
| Sherpa | 12 Feb | 13 Feb | 1 day | 4+ journey maps |
| Advocate | 12 Feb | 14 Feb | 2 days | 1+ accessibility review |
| Ambassador | 12 Feb | 14 Feb | 2 days | 1+ enterprise assessment |

**Pattern observed:** The four "wave 2" roles (DPO, Sherpa, Advocate, Ambassador) all activated within 2 days of definition. This confirms the "demand-triggered activation" pattern identified in the v0.1.3 wrap-up -- roles activate when a brief creates demand for their expertise.

**Why this matters:** A fully activated 14-role team means every brief now receives comprehensive coverage. No perspective is missing from the analysis. This is the state the project needs to maintain going forward.

---

### M012: Cache Service Operational

**Date:** 14 February 2026
**Significance:** The MGraph-AI Cache Service is integrated, tested, and serving token management and analytics for the admin Lambda. This is the first time an external service (beyond osbot-* utilities) has been integrated into the runtime path.

**Integration timeline:**
```
13 Feb AM    Cache service discovered as existing PyPI package
             Effort estimate reduced from 25-35h to 8-12h
             5 roles reviewed and approved
13 Feb PM    Send__Cache__Client wrapper created
             Service__Tokens implemented (full CRUD)
             Service__Analytics__Pulse implemented
             Middleware__Analytics wired
             Routes__Tokens and Routes__Analytics tested
14 Feb       Inter-Lambda communication operational
             Environment variables wired through CI
             111+ tests passing
```

**Discovery-to-operational:** Less than 24 hours from discovering the package exists to having it operational with tests. This validates the "cache service discovery" pattern (see Section 3).

---

### M013: Inter-Lambda Communication Established

**Date:** 14 February 2026
**Significance:** The user Lambda can now call the admin Lambda via the Service Registry pattern. Token validation works across Lambda boundaries.

**Architecture established:**
```
User Lambda  --[Service Registry]-->  Admin Lambda
  |                                      |
  +-- Admin__Service__Client             +-- Routes__Tokens
  |   (IN_MEMORY for tests)              +-- Routes__Analytics
  |   (REMOTE for production)            +-- Send__Cache__Client
  |                                      +-- Service__Tokens
  +-- token_use(name)                    +-- Service__Analytics__Pulse
  +-- token_lookup(name)
```

**Why this matters:** This is the first inter-service communication in the project. Previously, the user Lambda was self-contained. The Service Registry pattern means the same code runs in tests (IN_MEMORY, zero latency) and production (REMOTE, HTTP calls). This architectural decision was validated by the v0.2.41 Architect review (three-pillar assessment).

### 2.3 Velocity Analysis

The v0.3.0 sprint produced approximately **6x the output** of the infrastructure sprint in **half the time**. This 12x effective velocity increase is explained by three factors:

1. **Infrastructure leverage.** The infrastructure sprint built the foundation (CI pipeline, Lambda deployment, domain setup, IFD methodology, role system). The v0.3.0 sprint built on that foundation. The foundational work has a multiplier effect: every subsequent sprint benefits from it.

2. **Role system maturity.** With 14 roles producing parallel analysis, the team generates comprehensive coverage on every brief. The infrastructure sprint had 8 roles producing 8 responses. The v0.3.0 sprint had 14 roles producing 50+ responses -- this is not linear scaling, it is compounding expertise.

3. **IFD methodology.** Each UI version is additive, requiring no regression testing of previous versions. This removed the traditional bottleneck of "test everything before shipping anything." The team shipped 4 UI versions in 2 days -- this would not have been possible with a traditional single-version approach.

**Caution:** This velocity is not sustainable at peak. The 48,948 lines in 2 days includes substantial generated content (role responses, documentation, locale files, test fixtures). The "lines added" metric overstates the engineering effort compared to hand-written code. A more accurate measure would be "functional capabilities added" -- which is still impressive (4 UI versions, token system, analytics, cache service integration, inter-Lambda communication).

---

## 3. Named Patterns from This Sprint

### Pattern 6: Cache Service Discovery (Existing-Asset Leverage)

**Observation:** The team planned to build a custom cache layer (estimated 25-35 hours). During the architecture session, the MGraph-AI Cache Service was discovered as an existing PyPI package from the same organisation. Integration effort dropped to 8-12 hours. Five roles reviewed and approved the approach within one session.

**Named pattern:** "Discovery before invention." Before building, search for existing assets in the ecosystem. The osbot-* and MGraph-AI packages are maintained by the same organisation, creating a rich pool of pre-built capabilities that SGraph Send can leverage.

**Historical significance:** This is the most impactful cost reduction in the project so far. A 70% effort reduction (from 25-35h to 8-12h) on a critical-path deliverable, achieved by asking "does this already exist?" before writing code.

**Lesson:** The project should systematically audit the osbot-* and MGraph-AI ecosystems before designing any new infrastructure component. The v0.2.41 Architect review (osbot ecosystem assessment) was a step in this direction.

---

### Pattern 7: Brief-to-Ship Velocity (Two-Day Sprint Compression)

**Observation:** The v0.3.0 sprint compressed a full feature development cycle into 2 calendar days: brief received, roles respond, architecture designed, implemented, tested, deployed, announced. The v0.1.3 session (13 Feb) demonstrated same-day compression; the v0.3.0 sprint extends this to a multi-day but still remarkably compressed cycle.

**Evolution of the pattern:**

| Sprint | Duration | Compression | Capabilities Delivered |
|--------|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Infrastructure (08-12 Feb) | 4 days | Baseline | Lambda, domain, CI, IFD, role system |
| v0.1.3 session (13 Feb) | 1 day | 4x faster | 3 UI versions, 7 bug fixes, LinkedIn post |
| v0.3.0 sprint (13-14 Feb) | 2 days | 2x faster (per capability) | Token system, analytics, cache service, inter-Lambda, 4 UI versions |

**Named pattern refinement:** "Accelerating returns." Each sprint is faster per capability delivered than the previous one. The returns accelerate because the foundational infrastructure accumulates -- each new capability builds on everything that came before.

**Risk:** Accelerating returns have a ceiling. When the foundation is complete and the team shifts to complex feature work (E2E encryption flows, Playwright tests, production hardening), velocity will naturally decrease. This is expected and healthy -- it means the team is tackling harder problems.

---

### Pattern 8: IFD Independence Lessons (Methodology Under Stress)

**Observation:** The Dev root cause analysis on 14 Feb revealed that v0.1.x UI versions are full class copies, not surgical overrides. This means the IFD "surgical override" principle was not followed -- each version contains complete copies of components, not just the changed methods.

**Named pattern:** "Methodology drift under velocity pressure." When shipping fast, the team took shortcuts that violated the IFD methodology. The versions are functionally correct (each version works) but structurally non-compliant (they are not surgical overrides).

**Decision made:** Accept the current state. Fix the structural compliance at v0.2.0 consolidation. This is pragmatic -- the versions work, the rollback capability exists (each version is a separate folder), and refactoring the surgical override structure has zero user-visible benefit.

**Historical significance:** This is the first documented case of methodology drift in the project. The team identified it, analysed the root cause, and made a conscious decision to defer remediation rather than pretending it did not happen. This is healthy engineering culture -- acknowledging technical debt rather than hiding it.

**Lesson recorded:** IFD surgical overrides require discipline that is difficult to maintain during high-velocity sessions. The Dev guidance should include a pre-commit check: "Is this a surgical override or a full copy? If full copy, is there a justification?"

---

### Pattern 9: Gravitational Centralisation Validated

**Observation:** The cache service (D026 -- "gravity component" from the v0.2.33 review) is now operational and serving both token management and analytics. The gravitational centralisation predicted in Pattern B of the v0.2.33 review is now empirically confirmed.

**Evidence of centralisation:**

```
Cache Service (gravity centre)
  |
  +-- Token management (CRUD, usage tracking, revocation)
  +-- Analytics (raw event recording, temporal storage)
  +-- Pulse (real-time traffic monitoring)
  +-- Cost tracking (planned, infrastructure ready)
  +-- Transfer event caching (planned, infrastructure ready)
```

Five concerns resolved through one component. The concentration risk flagged in Q002 (v0.2.33) remains an open question -- no design flaw has been found, but the risk is structural, not probabilistic.

**Named pattern confirmation:** "Gravity component" is now a proven pattern, not just a theoretical concern. The cache service is the gravitational centre of the admin Lambda, and its operational success validates the decision to centralise.

---

### Pattern 10: Version Bump as Communication Signal

**Observation:** The project lead bumped the version from v0.2.41 to v0.3.0 explicitly to signal the completion of the foundational sprint. The version number is being used as a communication tool, not just a technical marker.

**Named pattern:** "Semantic signalling." Version numbers carry meaning beyond the code they represent:
- v0.1.x = MVP infrastructure (foundation)
- v0.2.x = Feature development (building on foundation)
- v0.3.0 = Foundation complete (milestone signal)

**Historical significance:** This is the first time a version bump has been explicitly justified in a brief ("The scope of change justifies a minor version bump"). Previous version increments were automatic (CI pipeline tag bumps). v0.3.0 is a deliberate, human-authored decision to communicate project state through the version number.

---

## 4. Decision Log Update

### Decisions from v0.3.0 Brief (D034+)

The v0.3.0 brief contains several implicit decisions that should be recorded:

| ID | Decision | Date | Rationale | Made By |
|----|----------|------|-----------|---------|
| D034 | **IN_MEMORY + S3 prefix for cache service** | 2026-02-14 | Cache service runs in-process with S3 prefix isolation (`admin/`). Previously approved conditionally by AppSec (M1-M6 requirements). Now operational. | Architect, AppSec |
| D035 | **Admin UI first for modular architecture (reconfirmed)** | 2026-02-14 | Originally D032. Reconfirmed as Priority 1 in v0.3.0 brief. Admin console is the next major deliverable. | Human (project lead) |
| D036 | **Web Components + IFD for admin UI** | 2026-02-14 | Admin UI follows the same IFD methodology as the user UI. Shell/router pattern from the IFD Web Components guide. | Architect, Human (project lead) |
| D037 | **v0.2.41 to v0.3.0 version bump -- foundational sprint complete** | 2026-02-14 | The version bump signals the completion of the foundational sprint. All infrastructure is operational. Future work builds on this foundation. | Human (project lead) |

### Decision Supersession

- D035 reconfirms D032. No contradiction -- D035 is an explicit re-prioritisation of an existing decision.
- D036 is new but consistent with D031 (IFD non-negotiable) and D032 (admin UI first).
- D037 is a milestone decision, not a technical decision. It establishes v0.3.0 as a reference point.

### Cumulative Decision Statistics (D001-D037)

| Brief / Session | Decisions | Range |
|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| Infrastructure brief (08 Feb) | 13 | D001-D013 |
| Daily Brief #1 (13 Feb) | 10 | D014-D023 |
| Daily Brief #2 (13 Feb) | 10 | D024-D033 |
| v0.3.0 Brief (14 Feb) | 4 | D034-D037 |
| **Total** | **37** | D001-D037 |

---

## 5. Open Questions Update

### Resolved

| ID | Question | Resolution |
|----|----------|------------|
| Q002 | Concentration risk if cache service has a design flaw | **PARTIALLY RESOLVED** -- The cache service is now operational with tests. No design flaw discovered. The concentration risk is structural and will persist as long as the cache service is the single data backbone. AppSec's conditional approval (M1-M6) provides guardrails. Downgrade to monitoring status. |

### Still Open

| ID | Question | Status | Update |
|----|----------|--------|--------|
| Q001 | Cache hash collision risk for human-friendly token names | Open | Architect to confirm. Not yet addressed. |
| Q003 | LETS pipeline trigger mechanism | Open | Not yet addressed. Cost tracking (D033) is planned but not implemented. |
| Q004 | Memory-FS migration path if cache service backend needs replacement | Open | The three-pillar assessment (v0.2.41) confirms pluggability via Storage_FS abstraction. Downgrade to low priority. |

### New Questions

| ID | Question | Raised By | Date | Status |
|----|----------|-----------|------|--------|
| Q005 | How will the admin UI login page be exempted from API key auth in the admin Lambda? Is there a `Serverless__Fast_API` mechanism for route exemptions, or does it require custom middleware? | Historian (from Architect review AQ1) | 2026-02-14 | Open -- DevOps/Dev to design |
| Q006 | At what velocity does IFD structural compliance break down? The v0.1.x versions demonstrate that full-copy versions are produced under high velocity, not surgical overrides. Is there a velocity threshold below which surgical overrides are practical? | Historian (from Pattern 8) | 2026-02-14 | Open -- Dev/QA to assess |

## 9. Comparative Sprint Analysis

### Sprint Fingerprints

| Dimension | Infrastructure Sprint (08-12 Feb) | v0.3.0 Sprint (13-14 Feb) |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Character** | Foundation-laying | Capability-stacking |
| **Bottleneck** | CI pipeline, deployment | Nothing (all systems operational) |
| **Risk profile** | High (first deployment) | Low (building on proven infrastructure) |
| **Decision type** | Architectural (D001-D013) | Capability + policy (D014-D037) |
| **Reversals** | 0 | 1 (D024 -- GA removal) |
| **Public visibility** | Domain goes live | LinkedIn showcase |
| **Role coverage** | 8 of 10 roles | 14 of 14 roles |
| **Methodology** | Establishing IFD | Stress-testing IFD |
| **Output ratio** | 1x (baseline) | 12x (per-capability, normalised) |

### Velocity Ceiling Prediction

Based on the two sprints, the project is approaching a velocity ceiling where:
1. **Infrastructure returns diminish** -- the foundation is built, future infrastructure work has lower multiplier effect
2. **Complexity increases** -- E2E encryption flows, Playwright tests, and production hardening are inherently slower than adding UI features or wiring backend services
3. **Quality gates engage** -- 111+ tests must pass, 28 risk register entries must be managed, AppSec has 28 active action items

**Predicted velocity for next sprint:** 4-6x the infrastructure sprint baseline (down from 12x). This is not a regression -- it reflects the transition from "easy wins on a new platform" to "hard problems on a mature platform."
