## 1. Milestone Record: Explorer/Villager Split

### M014: Explorer/Villager Team Split — First Structural Reorganisation

**Date:** 14 February 2026
**Version:** v0.3.2
**Significance:** The project's single team split into two teams based on Simon Wardley's team topology. This is the first organisational structure change since the project's inception and marks the transition from "can we build this?" to "can we build this AND ship this reliably, simultaneously?"

**What happened:**

The v0.3.2 daily brief and Wardley Maps brief introduced a two-team structure:

| Team | Wardley Stage | Focus | Output |
|------|---------------|-------|--------|
| **Explorer** | Genesis to Custom-Built | Discover, experiment, build first versions | Minor versions (IFD) |
| **Villager** | Custom-Built to Product | Stabilise, harden, deploy to production | Major versions (IFD releases) |

**Why it happened:**

The end-to-end MVP was proven. A user could open the page, authenticate with a token, drag and drop a file, encrypt it in the browser, copy the link, open a new window, paste the link, and download the file. With the core flow working, continuing to explore new features while simultaneously needing to ship a stable production release created a fundamental tension. The single-team model could not serve both objectives without one degrading the other.

The Wardley Maps framework provided the conceptual vocabulary: components at different evolutionary stages require fundamentally different ways of working. The encryption flow, upload/download, S3 backend, and token system had moved from genesis to custom-built and were ready for productisation. The landing page, admin interface, observability, multilingual support, themes, large file transfer, and design/brand identity remained at genesis and needed continued exploration.

**Why this matters for the historical record:**

1. **Organisational maturation.** This is the project growing from a prototype-stage team into a product-stage organisation. The split acknowledges that building and shipping are different disciplines, not different phases of the same discipline.

2. **Methodology adoption.** Wardley Maps are not merely a reference — they are now an operational framework. The Cartographer role is explicitly tasked with maintaining the evolution map. Team assignment decisions are made based on where components sit on the evolution axis. This is theory becoming practice.

3. **Two new meta-roles created.** The Explorer and Villager roles are "meta-roles" — they sit above the existing 17 roles and provide team-level leadership. This is the first time the role system has introduced hierarchical structure. Previously, all roles operated as peers coordinated by the Conductor. Now there is a layer above: the Explorer leads the exploration track, the Villager leads the productisation track, and the Conductor orchestrates both.

4. **The "theft" mechanism formalised.** The handover from Explorer to Villager is explicitly defined as a deliberate act — the Villager "takes" mature components from the Explorer. The handover brief is the contract. This is the first inter-team protocol in the project.

5. **Infrastructure separation mandated.** Explorer and Villager teams will operate in separate AWS environments, separate deployment pipelines, separate branches. This is the first time the project has required environment isolation. Previously, there was one environment (with dev/staging/prod tiers within it).

6. **Town Planners deliberately deferred.** The brief explicitly states that the third Wardley Maps team archetype is NOT being created yet. This is a disciplined scope decision — introduce structure only when the project has reached the stage that warrants it. The Town Planners come when components reach commodity stage (fully automated, utility-scale). That is not where we are.

**Decisions captured (continuing from D037):**

| ID | Decision | Date | Rationale | Made By |
|----|----------|------|-----------|---------|
| D038 | **Explorer/Villager two-team split adopted** | 2026-02-14 | MVP proven, need parallel exploration and productisation. Wardley Maps provides the framework. | Human (project lead) |
| D039 | **Town Planners team deferred** | 2026-02-14 | No components at commodity stage yet. Premature to create the third team. | Human (project lead) |
| D040 | **Explorer and Villager meta-roles created** | 2026-02-14 | Each team needs a leader above the individual roles. Meta-roles provide team-level direction. | Human (project lead) |
| D041 | **Wardley Maps adopted as operational framework** | 2026-02-14 | Not just conceptual — the Cartographer maintains the map, teams are assigned based on component maturity. | Human (project lead) |
| D042 | **Distinct environments mandated for Explorer/Villager** | 2026-02-14 | Separate AWS infra, separate pipelines, separate branches. Explorer experiments must never affect production. | Human (project lead) |
| D043 | **Handover brief protocol established** | 2026-02-14 | Explorer produces a handover brief when declaring a component mature. Villager verifies completeness before accepting. Brief is the contract. | Human (project lead) |
| D044 | **Design agency engagement approved** | 2026-02-14 | First external service provider. Logo, brand identity, website mockups. Uses our own file sharing service for file exchange. | Human (project lead) |
| D045 | **Issues FS adoption mandated** | 2026-02-14 | Every active workstream gets a `.issues` file. New flat-file format lowers adoption barrier. | Human (project lead) |
| D046 | **Large file transfer identified as key differentiator** | 2026-02-14 | User feedback: 1 GB+ files are the sweet spot. S3 backend has no meaningful size limit. Chunked uploads, retry, checksum on the roadmap. | Human (project lead), from user feedback |
| D047 | **Unencrypted mode under evaluation** | 2026-02-14 | Default remains encrypted. Explicit opt-out for non-sensitive large file use cases. Pluggable, not architectural. Under review by Advocate, AppSec, Architect. | Human (project lead) |

**Cumulative decision count: D001-D047 (47 decisions in 6 working days).**

## 2. Project Narrative Update

### The Story So Far

The Wardley Maps brief explicitly requests that this narrative be captured. Here it is, as a continuous historical arc:

---

**Phase 1: Genesis (8-12 February 2026)**
*A single team, a blank canvas, and a brief.*

SGraph Send began on 8 February 2026 with a project brief: build a zero-knowledge encrypted file-sharing service. The initial team was a single Claude Code agent operating across 10 roles (Conductor, Architect, Dev, QA, DevOps, Librarian, Cartographer, AppSec, Historian, Journalist). The first four days were pure infrastructure: setting up the Lambda architecture, deploying to AWS, configuring the domain (`send.sgraph.ai`), establishing the CI pipeline, adopting the IFD (Iterative Flow Development) methodology, and defining the role system.

By 12 February, the MVP was live — a user could visit the page, but the core encryption and file-sharing flow was still being built. Three milestones marked this phase: first deployment (M001), domain live (M002), and the first real user test (M003). Thirteen architectural decisions were logged (D001-D013). The team operated entirely in what we would later call "Explorer mode" — discovering, experimenting, building first versions.

**Phase 2: Acceleration (13 February 2026)**
*The sprint that built the product.*

13 February was the most productive single day in the project's history. Five briefs were processed. Ten roles produced responses. The team shipped three UI versions in a single day (v0.1.1, v0.1.2, v0.1.3), each adding new capabilities: hash-fragment URLs, text input mode, auto-decrypt, internationalisation with four languages (English, PT-BR, PT-PT, Klingon), and seven bug fixes.

Google Analytics was removed — the first strategic reversal (D024) — as the team committed fully to zero third-party scripts and zero tracking. The cache service was discovered as an existing PyPI package from the same organisation, reducing the estimated integration effort by 70% (from 25-35 hours to 8-12 hours). The project's first public presence appeared: a LinkedIn post showcasing the multilingual file-sharing workflow.

Three new roles were defined (Advocate, Sherpa, Ambassador) and a fourth (DPO) was added, expanding the team from 10 to 14. All activated within two days of definition. Six milestones were recorded (M004-M009). Twenty decisions were logged (D014-D033). The "brief-to-ship-to-announce" cycle compressed to same-day delivery (M009).

**Phase 3: Foundation Complete (13-14 February 2026)**
*The two-day sprint: 452 files, 48,948 lines, 50+ commits.*

Across 13-14 February, the foundational sprint produced an order-of-magnitude increase over the infrastructure phase: approximately 12x the effective velocity in half the time. The cache service was integrated. Inter-Lambda communication was established (M013). The token system reached full CRUD (create, read, update, delete). Analytics moved from third-party (Google Analytics) to first-party (server-side via cache service). The version was bumped from v0.2.41 to v0.3.0 — the first deliberate minor version increment — signalling that the platform foundation was complete (M010).

All 14 roles were active and producing deliverables (M011). The historical record at this point: 13 milestones, 37 decisions, 14 named patterns, 6 open questions.

**Phase 4: The Split (14 February 2026)**
*One team becomes two. The project grows up.*

With the end-to-end MVP proven — a user could encrypt a file in the browser, upload it, share a link, and the recipient could download and decrypt it — the project reached the transition point that Wardley Maps describes as the moment Explorers and Villagers diverge.

The v0.3.2 briefs formalised this. The single team split into two:

- **The Explorer team** would continue pushing the frontier: design agency engagement, landing page improvements, large file transfer research, Issues FS adoption, observability pipeline, multilingual and multi-theme support.
- **The Villager team** would take the proven MVP and ship it to production: performance optimisation, deployment hardening, monitoring, security hardening, the first IFD major release.

Two meta-roles (Explorer and Villager) were created to lead each team. The Cartographer was identified as the connective tissue between teams — maintaining the evolution map that determines what moves from exploration to productisation. The handover protocol was defined: Explorer produces a brief, Villager verifies and accepts, the component is frozen functionally from that point.

Three additional roles were added (CISO, GRC, and the Explorer/Villager meta-roles themselves), bringing the total to 17 roles plus 2 meta-roles. The project simultaneously onboarded its first external service provider (a design agency) and began evaluating new feature directions from user feedback (large file transfers as the key differentiator, unencrypted mode as a pluggable option).

**The narrative arc:** Single team (10 roles) builds infrastructure. Team expands (14 roles) and accelerates. MVP proven. Team splits (17 roles, 2 teams) to pursue exploration and productisation in parallel. The project transitions from "can we build this?" to "can we build this AND ship this reliably?" — the classic genesis-to-custom-built inflection point.

## 4. Velocity Tracking

### The Pace of Discovery

The project's velocity has followed a characteristic acceleration curve, now entering a new phase:

| Sprint | Duration | Key Metric | Velocity Character |
|--------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Infrastructure (08-12 Feb) | 4 days | 3 milestones, 13 decisions, ~50 files | **Foundation-laying.** Slow by output, but everything after depends on it. |
| v0.3.0 Sprint (13-14 Feb) | 2 days | 10 milestones, 24 decisions, 452 files, 48,948 lines | **Acceleration.** 12x effective velocity over baseline. |
| v0.3.2 Structural (14 Feb) | Same day | 1 milestone, 10 decisions, 2 new role definitions, 1 framework brief | **Maturation.** Output is structural, not code. |

### Velocity Type Shift

The v0.3.2 brief marks a shift in what "velocity" means:

- **Phases 1-3 (08-14 Feb):** Velocity measured in code output — files changed, lines added, tests passing, UI versions shipped, bugs fixed.
- **Phase 4 (14 Feb, v0.3.2):** Velocity measured in structural decisions — team splits, role definitions, framework adoptions, process formalisation.

This is not a slowdown. It is a gear change. The project is now producing organisational infrastructure alongside technical infrastructure. The v0.3.2 brief contains zero code changes but introduces the most consequential structural change since the project began.

### Discovery Pace Indicators

| Indicator | Value | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Decisions per day (D001-D047, 6 days) | 7.8/day | High. The team is making nearly 8 recorded decisions daily. |
| Milestones per day (M001-M014, 6 days) | 2.3/day | High. Averaging over 2 significant milestones per working day. |
| Named patterns per day (14 patterns, 6 days) | 2.3/day | High. The team is identifying and naming behavioural patterns faster than most projects do in months. |
| Role activation time | 0-2 days from definition | Extremely fast. No role has remained dormant for more than 2 days after definition. |
| Brief-to-ship cycle | Same day (best case) | Compressed. The IFD methodology enables this. |
| New roles per week | 9 (from 10 to 19) | Rapid team scaling. Almost doubled in one week. |

### Velocity Ceiling Prediction (Updated from v0.3.0)

The v0.3.0 review predicted a velocity decrease to 4-6x baseline for the next sprint. With the Explorer/Villager split, this prediction needs refinement:

- **Explorer team velocity:** Expected to remain high (6-8x baseline) for feature exploration. The Explorers keep the fast, experimental culture.
- **Villager team velocity:** Expected to be lower (2-3x baseline) by design. The Villagers trade speed for reliability. Their output is measured in production stability, not lines of code.
- **Combined velocity:** Will appear lower than the v0.3.0 sprint because the two teams are optimising for different things. This is correct behaviour, not a regression.

---

## 5. Decision History

### Structural Decisions of 14 February 2026

The v0.3.2 briefs contain a cluster of decisions that are structural — they change how the project operates, not what the project builds. These deserve special historical attention because they are harder to reverse than technical decisions.

#### 5.1 The Explorer/Villager Split (D038)

**Category:** Organisational structure
**Reversibility:** Low. Once teams are separated with distinct environments, merging them back requires significant coordination.
**Precedent:** Based on Simon Wardley's team topology, widely adopted in industry. Not experimental.
**Risk:** Role confusion (does an agent operate as Explorer Dev or Villager Dev?), handover friction (the "theft" mechanism requires discipline), environment drift (Explorer and Villager environments diverge over time).
**Mitigation:** Clear role definitions provided, Cartographer maintains the shared map, Conductor orchestrates both teams.

#### 5.2 Wardley Maps as Operational Framework (D041)

**Category:** Methodology adoption
**Reversibility:** Medium. Could revert to single-team without abandoning the conceptual framework.
**Precedent:** Wardley Maps are a respected strategic planning tool. Using them to drive team structure is more advanced but documented in Wardley's writings.
**Risk:** Over-classification (spending more time mapping than building), map-territory confusion (the map is not the product).
**Mitigation:** The Cartographer owns the map, preventing everyone from mapping independently. The framework informs decisions but does not make them.

#### 5.3 Design Agency Engagement (D044)

**Category:** External partnerships
**Reversibility:** High. Contractual engagement, can be terminated.
**Significance:** First external service provider. Marks the transition from purely internal team to team-plus-vendors. Also creates a real user of SGraph Send (the agency will use the file-sharing service for deliverable exchange).
**Risk:** Communication overhead, scope creep in design brief, design output not matching technical constraints.
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive brief and kickoff presentation required before engagement begins.

#### 5.4 Large File Transfer as Key Differentiator (D046)

**Category:** Product strategy
**Reversibility:** High. Feature roadmap item, not yet built.
**Significance:** This emerged directly from user feedback — not team speculation. A user identified the 1 GB+ sweet spot unprompted. This is the first time the product's differentiation strategy has been informed by real user input rather than team hypothesis.
**Historical note:** The "Why not WeTransfer?" reaction is equally significant. It means the file-sharing utility is immediately understood, but the differentiation is not yet communicated. The product has a positioning problem, not a comprehension problem.

### Cumulative Decision Statistics (D001-D047)

| Brief / Session | Decisions | Range | Decision Type |
|-----------------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Infrastructure brief (08 Feb) | 13 | D001-D013 | Architectural |
| Daily Brief #1 (13 Feb) | 10 | D014-D023 | Capability + policy |
| Daily Brief #2 (13 Feb) | 10 | D024-D033 | Capability + policy |
| v0.3.0 Brief (14 Feb) | 4 | D034-D037 | Consolidation |
| **v0.3.2 Briefs (14 Feb)** | **10** | **D038-D047** | **Structural + strategic** |
| **Total** | **47** | D001-D047 | |

**Decision type evolution:** The project's decisions have progressed through a recognisable maturation sequence:
1. **Architectural** (D001-D013): "How do we build this?"
2. **Capability + Policy** (D014-D033): "What should it do? What rules apply?"
3. **Consolidation** (D034-D037): "What have we accomplished?"
4. **Structural + Strategic** (D038-D047): "How should we organise to build and ship?"

This sequence — build, define, consolidate, reorganise — is a textbook project maturation arc. Each decision type depends on the previous type being resolved.

---

## 6. What This Transition Means

### From Prototype to Product (While Continuing to Explore)

The v0.3.2 team split is not a "pivot." It is a bifurcation. The project is not abandoning exploration for productisation, nor deferring productisation for further exploration. It is doing both, simultaneously, with explicit separation.

This is the critical insight from Wardley Maps applied in practice: **you can have genesis-stage and product-stage components in the same system, but you cannot manage them with the same team, the same process, or the same success criteria.**

The Explorer team's success metric is: "Did we discover something useful?" The Villager team's success metric is: "Is it running reliably in production?" These metrics are not just different — they are in tension. Speed of discovery trades off against stability of deployment. The two-team structure resolves this tension by giving each metric its own team.

### What Changes Operationally

| Aspect | Before v0.3.2 (single team) | After v0.3.2 (two teams) |
|--------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Briefs | One set of briefs for all roles | Team-specific briefs (Explorer briefs, Villager briefs) |
| Version management | Single version stream (v0.1.x through v0.3.x) | Two version streams: Explorer minor versions + Villager releases |
| Deployment | One pipeline | Two pipelines to separate environments |
| Success criteria | "Does it work?" | Explorer: "Did we learn something?" / Villager: "Is it production-grade?" |
| Role behaviour | Roles have one mode | Roles have two modes (Explorer behaviour, Villager behaviour) |
| Quality gates | Tests pass | Explorer: tests pass. Villager: tests pass + load tests + security review + monitoring |
| Inter-team communication | N/A (single team) | Handover briefs, Cartographer's evolution map, Conductor orchestration |

### What Does Not Change

- The role system itself (17 roles remain)
- The IFD methodology (additive versioning, no overrides)
- The technology stack (FastAPI, Type_Safe, Memory-FS, Web Crypto API)
- The security posture (zero-knowledge, client-side encryption by default)
- The human stakeholder structure (Dinis Cruz as project lead and decision-maker)
- The debrief and documentation culture
- The Historian's mandate to record everything

### The Maturation Trajectory

```
Feb 08: 1 team, 10 roles, 0 code, 0 users
        |
        v
Feb 12: 1 team, 14 roles, MVP deployed, domain live, first user
        |
        v
Feb 13: 1 team, 14 roles, 4 UI versions, 4 languages, GA removed, LinkedIn post
        |
        v
Feb 14: 1 team, 14 roles, v0.3.0 foundation complete, 111+ tests, cache service
        |
        v
Feb 14: 2 teams, 17+2 roles, Wardley Maps operational, design agency, user feedback
        (v0.3.2)
```

**Six working days.** From zero to two-team product organisation with a working MVP, external partnerships, and an operational strategic framework. This velocity is worth recording because it will not be repeated — the conditions that enabled it (greenfield project, single human stakeholder, AI-native team, focused scope) are unique to the genesis stage.

## 7. Carries Forward — Updates Required to v0.3.0 Records

The following items from the v0.3.0 review need updating in light of v0.3.2:

### 7.1 Milestone Registry Update

| ID | Milestone | Date | Recorded In |
|----|-----------|------|-------------|
| M001-M013 | (Unchanged) | Various | Previous reviews |
| **M014** | **Explorer/Villager team split — first structural reorganisation** | **2026-02-14** | **This action plan** |

**Next milestone to watch for:** M015 will likely be either the first Villager IFD release (production deployment) or the first Explorer-to-Villager handover. Both are expected within the next sprint.

### 7.2 Named Pattern Registry Update

| # | Pattern Name | First Observed | Source |
|---|-------------|----------------|--------|
| 1-10 | (Unchanged — see v0.3.0 review) | Various | Previous reviews |
| A-D | (Unchanged — see v0.3.0 review) | Various | Previous reviews |
| **11** | **Team bifurcation at maturity threshold** | **14 Feb** | **This action plan** |
| **12** | **Structural decisions cluster** | **14 Feb** | **This action plan** |
| **13** | **User-informed differentiation** | **14 Feb** | **This action plan** |

**Pattern 11: Team bifurcation at maturity threshold.**
The project operated as a single team until the MVP was proven, then split into two. The split was not gradual — it was a discrete event triggered by a maturity signal (end-to-end flow working). This matches Wardley's prediction: team structure changes happen at evolutionary stage transitions, not on a schedule.

**Pattern 12: Structural decisions cluster.**
D038 through D047 are all structural or strategic decisions, logged within a single brief cycle. Structural decisions tend to cluster — when the project decides to reorganise, multiple related decisions cascade. The 10 decisions in v0.3.2 compare to 4 consolidation decisions in v0.3.0 and 10 capability decisions in each of the v0.2.x briefs. The decision type changed, but the decision volume remained constant.

**Pattern 13: User-informed differentiation.**
The "Why not WeTransfer?" reaction and the "big files are the sweet spot" insight both came from real users, not from team brainstorming. The project's differentiation strategy is now being shaped by market feedback rather than internal hypothesis. This is the explorer-to-custom-built transition at the product level — we are no longer guessing what the product should be.

**Cumulative named patterns: 17** (13 numbered + 4 lettered).

### 7.3 Open Questions Update

| ID | Question | Status | Update |
|----|----------|--------|--------|
| Q001 | Cache hash collision risk for human-friendly token names | Open | Not addressed in v0.3.2 briefs |
| Q003 | LETS pipeline trigger mechanism | Open | Not addressed in v0.3.2 briefs |
| Q004 | Memory-FS migration path if cache service backend needs replacement | Low priority | Unchanged |
| Q005 | Admin UI login page auth exemption | Open | Unchanged |
| Q006 | IFD structural compliance velocity threshold | Open | Relevant to Villager team — structural compliance is a productisation concern |

**New questions from v0.3.2:**

| ID | Question | Raised By | Date | Status |
|----|----------|-----------|------|--------|
| Q007 | How does the Explorer/Villager handover actually work in practice? The protocol is defined conceptually, but no handover has been executed yet. What friction will emerge? | Historian | 2026-02-14 | Open — will be answered by the first handover |
| Q008 | How will team assignment work for agents? The brief says "an agent can be Explorer Dev in one workstream and Villager Dev in another" — but how is this tracked? Is it per-session, per-branch, per-issue? | Historian | 2026-02-14 | Open — Conductor to define |
| Q009 | What is the Villager team's definition of "production-ready"? The role definition lists activities (performance, scaling, monitoring, security, testing) but not acceptance criteria. When does the Villager declare a release ready to ship? | Historian | 2026-02-14 | Open — Villager role to define |
| Q010 | Will the design agency engagement produce a feedback loop? The brief suggests using SGraph Send to share design files with the agency. If the agency uses the product, their experience becomes user feedback. Is this intentional dogfooding? | Historian | 2026-02-14 | Open — appears intentional but not explicitly stated as a feedback mechanism |

### 7.4 Velocity Tracking Framework Update

The v0.3.0 review tracked velocity as a single stream. With two teams, velocity tracking needs to split:

| Metric | Explorer Tracking | Villager Tracking |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Output | Minor versions shipped, experiments run, features built | Releases deployed, production uptime, performance benchmarks |
| Decisions | Feature and capability decisions | Deployment and stability decisions |
| Milestones | Discovery milestones (new capability proven) | Delivery milestones (new release in production) |
| Pace indicator | Experiments per sprint, failed experiment ratio | Time to productise, rollback frequency |
| Quality indicator | Handover brief completeness (Villager feedback) | Production stability (uptime, error rate) |

### 7.5 Records Needing Versioned Updates

The following documents from v0.3.0 should be updated to v0.3.2 to reflect the team split:

| Document | What Needs Updating | Priority |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| Cumulative milestone registry | Add M014, update milestone velocity | P1 |
| Named pattern registry | Add patterns 11-13, update cumulative count | P1 |
| Timeline | Add v0.3.2 events | P1 |
| Decision log | Add D038-D047 | P1 |
| Sprint velocity comparison | Split into Explorer/Villager tracking | P2 |
| Open questions | Add Q007-Q010, update Q006 context | P2 |
| Velocity ceiling prediction | Revise for two-team model | P2 |
| Role activation timeline | Add Explorer/Villager meta-roles, update count to 17+2 | P3 |

## Summary

The v0.3.2 briefs mark the most consequential organisational change since the project's inception. The single-team model that built the MVP has split into Explorer and Villager teams, based on Wardley Maps team topology. This is captured as Milestone M014, with 10 new decisions (D038-D047), 3 new named patterns (bringing the total to 17), and 4 new open questions (Q007-Q010).

The project narrative now spans four phases: genesis (infrastructure), acceleration (feature building), foundation complete (v0.3.0 consolidation), and the split (v0.3.2 two-team structure). Six working days, 14 milestones, 47 decisions, 17 named patterns.

The Historian's role is now explicitly cross-team — tracking the evolution of both Explorer and Villager tracks, recording what moves between them and when, and maintaining the continuous narrative of a project growing from prototype to product while continuing to explore new territory.
