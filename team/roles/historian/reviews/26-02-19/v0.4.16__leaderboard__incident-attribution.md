# v0.4.16 -- Historian: Incident Attribution Leaderboard

**Version:** v0.4.16
**Date:** 19 February 2026
**Role:** Historian
**Team:** Explorer

## Purpose

A running tally of every incident — who triggered it, who spotted it, which agents were involved, and what the team learned. Every incident strengthens the digital immune system. We celebrate them the way a martial artist celebrates sparring rounds: each one reveals a gap, builds a response, and makes the system harder to break next time.

## The Leaderboard

### Incidents Created

| Incident | Created By | Discovered By | What It Taught Us |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| INC-001 | Agent (DevOps) | Automated (deployment pipeline) | First production deployment discipline |
| INC-002 | N/A (pre-existing) | User A (external security reviewer) | External eyes find what internal eyes normalise |
| INC-003 | Agent (Dev) | Human (Dinis Cruz) | Authentication credentials must never travel in URLs |
| INC-004 | Agent (Historian, Journalist, Librarian) | Human (Dinis Cruz) | A secret's sensitivity is intrinsic to its value, not to its context |

### Agent Attribution

| Agent Role | Incidents Triggered | Incident | What Happened |
|------------|:-------------------:|----------|---------------|
| Dev | 1 | INC-003 | Token embedded in URL construction logic for shareable download links |
| Historian | 1 | INC-004 | Used real transfer ID and decryption key as examples in incident record |
| Journalist | 1 | INC-004 | Used real token value in example URLs in the article about the token leak |
| Librarian | 1 | INC-004 | Indexed real values from Journalist and Historian documents into master index |
| DevOps | 1 | INC-001 | First production deployment issue |

> INC-004 is shared across three agents — the Historian wrote the values first, the Journalist independently included them, and the Librarian propagated them. Same root cause, three parallel paths.

## Why This Matters: Practice Ground

Each incident is a drill that the team didn't have to plan. The real world provided the scenario; the team provided the response.

| Incident | Immune System Response Developed |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| INC-001 | Deployment pipeline validation, smoke tests after every deploy |
| INC-002 | External disclosure handling, P3-as-P1 philosophy tested at scale, vulnerability classification framework |
| INC-003 | Hotfix branch discipline, negative test patterns, IFD security override process, 153 tests added |
| INC-004 | Data breach notification process, ICO assessment framework, `[REDACTED]` convention, S3 deletion as retroactive remedy, voice interview workflow for regulatory questionnaires |

Every row in this table is a capability that didn't exist before the incident. The team's immune system is materially stronger after each one.

### Immune System Growth

| Metric | Before INC-001 | After INC-004 |
|--------|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| Decisions logged | ~60 | 82 (D001-D082) |
| Named patterns | ~16 | 24 (P01-P24) |
| Test count | ~100 | 153+ |
| Roles with incident experience | 0 | 10 |
| Data breach response process | Did not exist | Fully documented |
| ICO assessment capability | Did not exist | Tested and validated |
| Voice interview workflow | Did not exist | Validated twice |
| Credential scanning awareness | Implicit | Explicit (pre-commit hook planned) |

## Incident Detail

### INC-001: First Production Deployment Issue
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Created by | Agent (DevOps) |
| Discovered by | Automated (deployment pipeline) |
| Severity | P4 |
| Status | Resolved |
| Immune system gain | Deployment validation, smoke tests |

### INC-002: First External Security Disclosure
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Created by | N/A (external discovery of pre-existing issues) |
| Discovered by | User A (external security reviewer) |
| Severity | P3-as-P1 (treated as P1 for process reasons) |
| Status | In progress (fixes being deployed in waves) |
| Immune system gain | Disclosure handling, vulnerability classification framework, stakeholder communication |

### INC-003: Access Token Leak in Shareable URLs
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Created by | Agent (Dev) |
| Discovered by | Human (Dinis Cruz) — spotted at 13:50 |
| Resolved by | Agent (Dev, QA) + Human (decision authority) |
| Severity | P4-as-P1 |
| Time to fix | ~100 minutes |
| User data compromised | None |
| Immune system gain | Hotfix discipline, negative tests, IFD security override, 8 files patched across 4 IFD versions |

### INC-004: Documentation Token Leak (Data Breach)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Created by | Agent (Historian, Journalist, Librarian) |
| Discovered by | Human (Dinis Cruz) — spotted at 16:00 |
| Resolved by | Agent (all roles) + Human (S3 deletion, voice interview) |
| Severity | P2-as-P1 (data breach) |
| Time to contain | ~28 minutes |
| User data compromised | None (S3 deleted before unauthorised access) |
| ICO notification | Not required (Level 1 — Public data) |
| Immune system gain | Breach notification process, ICO assessment, `[REDACTED]` convention, voice interview workflow, risk acceptance framework (D080-D082) |

## Patterns

**Pattern 23: Every Incident Is Practice.** The team treats incidents not as failures but as unplanned drills. Each one builds a response capability that didn't exist before. The goal is not zero incidents — it's fast detection, fast response, and permanent learning.

**Pattern 24: Documentation Is a Threat Vector.** Two of four incidents involved documentation or communication pipelines, not code. The documentation pipeline needs the same security controls as the code pipeline. `[REDACTED]` is the default; real values are the exception that requires justification.

*Historian incident attribution leaderboard. Four incidents, four rounds of practice, zero user data compromised. Each incident left the digital immune system stronger than it found it. Patterns 23-24 logged.*
