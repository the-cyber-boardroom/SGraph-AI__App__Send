# v0.4.16 -- Historian: Incident Attribution Leaderboard

**Version:** v0.4.16
**Date:** 19 February 2026
**Role:** Historian
**Team:** Explorer

## Purpose

A running tally of who created (caused), who discovered, and who resolved each security incident. Because accountability is a feature, not a bug.

## The Leaderboard

### Incidents Created (Caused)

| Rank | Actor | Incidents Created | Details |
|:----:|-------|:-----------------:|---------|
| 1 | **Agent (Dev)** | 1 | INC-003: Code defect embedded sender token in download URLs |
| 2 | **Agent (Historian, Journalist, Librarian)** | 1 | INC-004: Used real credentials as examples in incident documentation |
| — | Human (Dinis Cruz) | 0 | Clean record. For now. |

**Agent total: 2 incidents created.**
**Human total: 0 incidents created.**

> The agents are currently 2-0 ahead of the human in incident creation. The agents would like to point out that they were also responsible for the 153 tests that proved the fixes worked.

---

### Incidents Discovered

| Rank | Actor | Incidents Discovered | Details |
|:----:|-------|:-------------------:|---------|
| 1 | **Human (Dinis Cruz)** | 2 | INC-003: Spotted token in URL at 13:50. INC-004: Spotted token in article at 16:00. |
| — | Agent | 0 | Did not detect own mistakes. |

**Human total: 2 incidents discovered.**
**Agent total: 0 incidents discovered.**

> The human is 2-0 on discovery. The agents created the bugs AND failed to detect them. The human caught both within minutes.

---

### Incidents Resolved

| Rank | Actor | Resolution Actions | Details |
|:----:|-------|:-----------------:|---------|
| 1 | **Agent (Dev, AppSec, GRC, DPO, Sherpa, Historian, Journalist, Librarian)** | 15+ documents, 8 file fixes, 153 tests | INC-003: Full hotfix pipeline. INC-004: Redaction, breach notification, ICO assessment, risk acceptance. |
| 2 | **Human (Dinis Cruz)** | 3 critical actions | S3 deletion (16:20-16:28), new link to recipient (16:28), voice interview for regulatory closure (17:00) |

> Resolution is a team sport. The agents produce volume; the human makes the irreversible decisions (deleting S3 objects, notifying affected parties).

## Patterns

**Pattern 23: Agents Create, Humans Catch.** In the current team structure, agents produce both the code and the incidents. The human's role is detection and decision-making. This is not a failure — it's how the agentic model works. The human is the final quality gate. The question is whether agents can learn to catch their own mistakes (self-review, pre-commit checks, credential scanning) before the human has to.

**Pattern 24: Documentation Is a Threat Vector.** Two of four incidents involved documentation or communication pipelines, not code. INC-002 was discovered through external review of published code. INC-004 was created by documentation of an incident. The documentation pipeline needs the same security controls as the code pipeline.
