## 1. Milestone Record

### M015: LETS Pipeline Live, AWS Logging Configured, Privacy-by-Design Validated

**Date:** 15 February 2026
**Version:** v0.3.10 (brief), v0.3.12 (recording)
**Significance:** The first operational data pipeline is running end-to-end. AWS logging is fully configured across CloudFront, Lambda, S3, and CloudWatch. The DPO role prevented IP address capture through the briefing process, validating the project's role-based governance model.

**What happened:**

Three achievements converged into a single milestone:

1. **LETS pipeline operational.** The Load-Extract-Transform-Save workflow is running end-to-end: collect from AWS, store in cache service, display in admin UI. This is the first collector for AWS data, deployed using the cache service itself. The pipeline architecture (documented in the brief's SA Deep Dive section) supports two data types: event-driven data (logs from CloudFront, Lambda, S3, CloudWatch) and collected data (API calls to AWS for configuration and metrics snapshots).

2. **AWS logging fully configured.** Working with DevOps, log capture is now enabled across CloudFront (via Firehose to S3), Lambda (CloudWatch), S3 access logs, and CloudWatch metrics. All data sources needed for Server Analytics are now flowing.

3. **Privacy-by-design validated through the role model.** When configuring AWS logging, the DPO role was monitoring the briefing process. The result: the DevOps configuration that went into AWS ensured that **IP addresses and other sensitive data are not captured in the logs**. This happened naturally through the team's role structure -- the DPO's presence ensured privacy was built in from the start, not added as an afterthought.

**Why this matters for the historical record:**

1. **First data pipeline.** M015 marks the transition from "application that serves files" to "application that understands its own operational behaviour." The LETS pipeline is the foundation for Server Analytics, which the brief describes as eventually becoming a standalone project (`server-analytics` PyPI package name already reserved).

2. **Role model governance proven.** The DPO's intervention in the logging configuration is the first concrete evidence that the multi-role model produces better outcomes than a single-team approach. A team without a DPO role would have captured IP addresses by default (standard AWS behaviour). The role's presence changed the outcome. This is the strongest validation of the role system since its inception.

3. **First Explorer-specific brief.** This milestone is recorded in the first daily brief addressed specifically to the Explorer team, rather than to the single unified team. The structural change from M014 (Explorer/Villager split) is now operationally real -- the briefing process has diverged.

4. **End-to-end admin flow confirmed.** The loop is closed: push changes to admin UI, grab data from cache service, display it. This pattern will be replicated across every SA dashboard view.

**Cumulative milestone count: M001-M015 (15 milestones in 7 working days).**

## 2. Decision Log Update

### Decision Numbering Reconciliation

**Important note on numbering:** The Librarian's v0.3.10 master index labels the new decisions from the 15 Feb brief as D038-D042. However, the Historian's v0.3.2 action plan (14 Feb) already recorded D038-D047 for the Explorer/Villager split decisions. This is a **numbering collision** -- two different sets of decisions assigned overlapping IDs.

**Resolution:** The Historian's record is the canonical decision log. D038-D047 were recorded on 14 February for the structural decisions (team split, Wardley Maps adoption, meta-roles, distinct environments, handover protocol, design agency, Issues FS, large file transfer, unencrypted mode). The decisions from the 15 Feb brief are therefore **D048-D052**, continuing the sequence.

The Librarian should be notified to update the master index with the corrected numbering.

### New Decisions: D048-D052 (15 February 2026)

| ID | Decision | Date | Rationale | Made By | Librarian Ref |
|----|----------|------|-----------|---------|---------------|
| D048 | **SA dashboard uses path-based URLs (not hash-fragment)** | 2026-02-15 | REST-style URLs enable bookmarking, sharing, and independent deployability of each view. Each route (`/admin/dashboard/cache/`, `/admin/dashboard/lambda/`, etc.) maps to a self-contained view component. | Human (project lead) | Librarian D038 |
| D049 | **Cache service browser is highest-priority SA view** | 2026-02-15 | Everything else depends on it. The cache browser is the development tool that validates the LETS pipeline and unblocks all other SA views (Lambda, CloudFront, infrastructure). Build it first, then fan out. | Human (project lead) | Librarian D039 |
| D050 | **Three-word key concept requires security review before any implementation** | 2026-02-15 | Entropy trade-off (three dictionary words vs. 256-bit key) must be evaluated by AppSec before Dev builds anything. Trademark/patent check on "What Three Words" also required. Explicit instruction: "Dev: don't implement yet." | Human (project lead) | Librarian D040 |
| D051 | **Upload/download resilience research starts immediately** | 2026-02-15 | Large file transfer identified as key differentiator (D046). Separate detailed briefing coming, but Architect and Dev should start the landscape research now: chunked uploads, streaming encryption, resumable transfers, S3 multipart, tus protocol, etc. | Human (project lead) | Librarian D041 |
| D052 | **Privacy-by-design validated -- DPO role prevents IP capture in logging config** | 2026-02-15 | Confirmed, not decided. The DPO role's presence in the briefing process resulted in AWS logging being configured without IP address capture. This validates the role model as a governance mechanism, not just an organisational tool. | Human (project lead), DPO role | Librarian D042 |

### Decision Type Analysis

| Brief / Session | Decisions | Range | Decision Type |
|-----------------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Infrastructure brief (08 Feb) | 13 | D001-D013 | Architectural |
| Daily Brief #1 (13 Feb) | 10 | D014-D023 | Capability + policy |
| Daily Brief #2 (13 Feb) | 10 | D024-D033 | Capability + policy |
| v0.3.0 Brief (14 Feb) | 4 | D034-D037 | Consolidation |
| v0.3.2 Briefs (14 Feb) | 10 | D038-D047 | Structural + strategic |
| **v0.3.10 Brief (15 Feb)** | **5** | **D048-D052** | **Operational + validation** |
| **Total** | **52** | D001-D052 | |

**Decision type evolution continues:** The 15 Feb decisions introduce a new type: **operational + validation**. These are decisions about how the product operates day-to-day (path-based routing, view priority, security review gates) and confirmations that prior architectural choices are working (privacy-by-design). This follows the maturation arc:

1. Architectural (D001-D013): "How do we build this?"
2. Capability + Policy (D014-D033): "What should it do? What rules apply?"
3. Consolidation (D034-D037): "What have we accomplished?"
4. Structural + Strategic (D038-D047): "How should we organise to build and ship?"
5. **Operational + Validation (D048-D052): "How should the product work day-to-day, and is our approach working?"**

This is the expected next step. The team has built the system (1), defined its capabilities (2), consolidated (3), reorganised (4), and is now operating the system while confirming that earlier decisions produce the intended outcomes (5).

**Cumulative decision count: D001-D052 (52 decisions in 7 working days, 7.4/day average).**

## 3. Patterns Observed

### Pattern 14: Privacy-by-Design as Role-Model Governance

**First observed:** 15 February 2026
**Source:** v0.3.10 brief, Progress Update section
**Description:** The DPO (Data Protection Officer) role, operating within the multi-role briefing process, prevented the default capture of IP addresses in AWS logging configuration. This happened without a separate privacy review, without a dedicated privacy sprint, and without a privacy incident triggering a remediation. The role's presence in the team was sufficient to change the outcome.

**Why this is a named pattern:** Most projects add privacy protections after a compliance review finds gaps, or after an incident. This project achieved privacy-by-design through team structure alone. The DPO was "keeping an eye on the brief" (quoting the human's description), and the DevOps configuration naturally excluded sensitive data. This is the role model functioning as a governance mechanism -- not policies enforcing behaviour, but roles embodying behaviour.

**Implications:** If a single role's presence can change an infrastructure configuration outcome, the role model is more than organisational convenience. It is a decision-influencing framework. This validates expanding the role system (currently 17+2) and suggests that adding new roles (e.g., accessibility, sustainability) would produce similar "built-in by default" outcomes in their respective domains.

**Historical precedent in this project:** This is the second validation of the role system's governance power. The first was M011 (all 14 roles active), which proved the model could scale. M015 proves the model changes outcomes.

### Pattern 15: Three-Track Sprint Structure

**First observed:** 15 February 2026
**Source:** v0.3.10 brief, "For the Conductor" section
**Description:** The brief explicitly organises work into three parallel tracks: (A) UX bug fixes (ship fast), (B) Server Analytics foundation (gated by cache browser), and (C) upload/download resilience research (start early, non-blocking). The Conductor is instructed to manage all three simultaneously.

**Why this is a named pattern:** Previous briefs organised work as a flat priority list (P1/P2/P3). The v0.3.10 brief introduces named tracks with different characteristics: Track A is iterative (fix, test, ship), Track B is sequential (cache browser gates everything else), Track C is exploratory (research, no delivery deadline). This is a maturation of the project's work management -- from "prioritised backlog" to "parallel streams with different cadences."

**Implications:** The three-track structure maps loosely to three Wardley stages: Track A (custom-built -- stabilise known features), Track B (genesis -- build new capabilities), Track C (concept -- research unknowns). The Conductor now manages not just priority but tempo -- each track has its own rhythm. This is a departure from the single-velocity model of the first week.

### Pattern 16: Explorer-Specific Briefing as Structural Divergence

**First observed:** 15 February 2026
**Source:** v0.3.10 brief header ("Explorer Team: Daily Brief")
**Description:** The v0.3.10 brief is addressed to "Explorer team via Conductor," not to the unified team. This is the first brief that exists solely within one team's context. The Villager team presumably receives (or will receive) its own separate brief.

**Why this is a named pattern:** The Explorer/Villager split (M014, D038) was a structural decision on 14 February. The v0.3.10 brief is the first operational evidence that the split has changed the briefing process. Decisions are structural; briefs are operational. When the operational artefacts diverge, the structural decision is real.

**Implications:** From this point forward, the Historian must track two briefing streams. The project's history is no longer a single timeline -- it branches into Explorer history and Villager history, with the Cartographer's evolution map and the handover protocol as the convergence points.

### Cumulative Named Patterns

| # | Pattern Name | First Observed |
|---|-------------|----------------|
| 1-10 | (See v0.3.0 review) | 08-14 Feb |
| 11 | Team bifurcation at maturity threshold | 14 Feb |
| 12 | Structural decisions cluster | 14 Feb |
| 13 | User-informed differentiation | 14 Feb |
| **14** | **Privacy-by-design as role-model governance** | **15 Feb** |
| **15** | **Three-track sprint structure** | **15 Feb** |
| **16** | **Explorer-specific briefing as structural divergence** | **15 Feb** |
| A-D | (See v0.3.0 review -- lettered patterns) | 13-14 Feb |

**Cumulative named patterns: 20** (16 numbered + 4 lettered).

## 5. Narrative Notes

### The Shift from Single-Team to Explorer-Specific Briefing

The v0.3.10 brief is a structural watershed, though it might not appear that way at first glance. It reads like a normal daily brief -- progress update, bug list, feature requests, research tasks. But the header tells the real story: "Explorer Team: Daily Brief."

This is the first time the human stakeholder has addressed a brief to a specific team rather than to the unified project. The implications cascade:

**What changed:**

- The brief assumes Explorer context. There is no mention of production stability, deployment hardening, performance optimisation, or monitoring -- those are Villager concerns. The brief is purely about discovery, experimentation, and building first versions.
- The task assignments reference only Explorer-relevant roles. The Villager team's concerns (which would include production deployment of the LETS pipeline, performance testing of the cache browser, security hardening of the SA dashboard) are absent.
- The "For the Conductor" section assumes a single-team Conductor managing three Explorer tracks, not a cross-team Conductor balancing Explorer and Villager priorities.

**What this means for the historical record:**

The project timeline is now branching. From 15 February onward, the Historian must maintain awareness of (at least) two parallel histories:

1. **Explorer history:** What was explored, what was discovered, what was built as first versions. Measured in experiments, prototypes, and research documents. This brief (v0.3.10) is the first entry.
2. **Villager history:** What was productised, what was hardened, what was deployed to production. Measured in releases, uptime, and stability metrics. No Villager brief has been seen yet -- Q009 remains open.

The Cartographer's evolution map becomes the tool that connects these two histories -- showing which components move from Explorer to Villager territory over time.

### The Privacy-by-Design Validation as a Proof Point

The human stakeholder's description of the privacy-by-design success deserves special attention. The phrasing is deliberate: "This happened naturally through the briefing process -- the DPO's presence in the team ensured privacy was built in from the start, not bolted on after."

This is the human explicitly recognising the role model as a governance mechanism. Not just an organisational tool, not just a way to divide work -- a way to ensure that important considerations (privacy, security, accessibility, etc.) are embedded in every decision, not added as afterthoughts.

The historical significance: this is the first time the human has pointed to a specific outcome and attributed it to the team structure rather than to individual effort. The role model is no longer theoretical. It has produced a measurable, attributable result.

### The Server Analytics Ambition

The SA Deep Dive section of the brief reveals an ambition larger than the current project scope. The human describes:

- A "digital twin" of the AWS environment (current state + historical state + change tracking + event correlation)
- A `server-analytics` PyPI package (name already reserved)
- A pattern ("smart collection: never fetch twice") that generalises beyond SGraph Send
- Four priority views that together constitute a lightweight AWS console replacement

This is the Explorer team exploring not just features for SGraph Send, but incubating a separate product within the SGraph Send codebase. Pattern 13 (user-informed differentiation) established that the product's direction is shaped by market feedback. The SA Deep Dive suggests a second product emerging from the development process itself -- Server Analytics as a tool that the team builds for itself and then offers to others.

This pattern -- tool built for internal use, then extracted as a product -- matches the origin of osbot-utils, osbot-aws, and osbot-fast-api in the broader SGraph ecosystem. The Historian should watch for the moment SA is formally extracted into its own repository or package, which would constitute a new milestone.

### The Three-Track Structure as Wardley Application

The brief's three-track structure maps to Wardley's evolution axis:

| Track | Brief Description | Wardley Stage | Characteristic |
|-------|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| A: UX Bug Fixes | Ship fast, fix known issues | Custom-Built (stabilising known features) | Iterative, fast cycle |
| B: SA Foundation | Build cache browser first, then fan out | Genesis (new capability being created) | Sequential, gated |
| C: Resilience Research | Start early, non-blocking | Concept (exploring unknowns) | Exploratory, no deadline |

This is Wardley Maps applied at the sprint level, not just the team level. The Explorer team itself contains work at multiple evolutionary stages, managed with different cadences. This refinement -- Wardley stages within a single team's sprint -- was predicted by the v0.3.2 role definition ("Explorer teams contain genesis AND custom-built work") but not operationally visible until this brief.

## Summary

The v0.3.10 brief marks three firsts: the first Explorer-team-specific brief, the first operational data pipeline (LETS), and the first concrete validation of the role model as a governance mechanism (DPO preventing IP capture in logging).

Milestone M015 captures the convergence of the LETS pipeline going live, AWS logging being fully configured, and privacy-by-design being validated through the DPO role's presence in the briefing process. Five new decisions are recorded as D048-D052 (correcting a numbering collision with the Librarian's index, which re-used D038-D042). Three new patterns bring the cumulative total to 20: privacy-by-design as role-model governance (Pattern 14), three-track sprint structure (Pattern 15), and Explorer-specific briefing as structural divergence (Pattern 16).

The most significant narrative shift is the transition from single-team briefing to team-specific briefing. The Explorer/Villager split (M014, 14 Feb) was a structural decision. The v0.3.10 brief (15 Feb) is the operational evidence that the split is real. From this point forward, the project's history branches into Explorer and Villager tracks.

Open questions Q011-Q013 raised: decision numbering ownership across roles, Server Analytics extraction timeline, and whether the three-track sprint structure recurs.

**Cumulative record: 15 milestones, 52 decisions, 20 named patterns, 13 open questions across 7 working days.**

---

*Historian action plan complete. This document records M015, logs D048-D052 (with Librarian numbering reconciliation), identifies 3 new patterns (14-16), raises 3 new questions (Q011-Q013), and captures the structural significance of the project's first Explorer-specific brief. The Historian is now tracking two parallel histories (Explorer and Villager), with the Explorer track starting here.*
