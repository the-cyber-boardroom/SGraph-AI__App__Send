# v0.4.25 — Addendum: Authenticity Verified

**Version:** v0.4.25

## Update to Milestone Record

The original milestone record documented the first encrypted message exchange and noted that sender authentication was "added post-milestone" in the same session. This addendum records the **completion** of that work: both confidentiality and authenticity are now verified end-to-end.

## What Changed

| Event | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Confidentiality (RSA-OAEP + AES-256-GCM) | Proven at v0.4.25 — LinkedIn announcement |
| Authenticity (ECDSA P-256 signatures) | **Now proven** — bidirectional verification confirmed |

### Evidence

Two final screenshots from the project owner show:
1. **prod → localhost:** Message signed by `dc-in-prod`, verified by localhost as "Signed by dc-in-prod — signature verified" (green)
2. **localhost → prod:** Message signed by `dc-in-localhost`, verified by prod as "Signed by dc-in-localhost — signature verified" (green)

All key pairs show ECDSA P-256 signing capability. All contacts show "verifiable" status.

## Updated Timeline

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| Session start | `crypto.subtle` error — fixed with secure context detection |
| Iteration 2 | Two-column grid layout, spacing compacted |
| Iteration 3 | SG/Send branding, overflow fixes, encrypt/decrypt workflow |
| **Milestone A** | **First encrypted message exchange (confidentiality)** |
| LinkedIn post | Public announcement by Dinis Cruz |
| Iteration 5 | ECDSA P-256 digital signatures added |
| Iteration 6 | Unsigned status messaging improved (contextual, not alarmist) |
| **Milestone B** | **First signed + verified message exchange (authenticity)** |
| Architect briefing | Full technical documentation with ASCII art workflows |
| Session wrap-up | QA verification, Librarian master index, this addendum |

## Updated Significance

The SG/Send PKI messaging system now provides **two of the three classic security properties:**

1. **Confidentiality** — Only the holder of the private key can decrypt
2. **Authenticity** — The sender's identity is cryptographically verified

The third property — **non-repudiation** with timestamping — is not yet implemented but is architecturally possible with the existing ECDSA infrastructure.

This completes the transition from "first encrypted message" to "first authenticated encrypted message" — the real MVP of a PKI-based communication system.
