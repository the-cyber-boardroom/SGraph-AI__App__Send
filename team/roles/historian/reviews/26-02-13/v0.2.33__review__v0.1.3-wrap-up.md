## 1. Milestone Record

### M004: First IFD-Compliant UI Version Sequence

**Date:** 13 February 2026
**Significance:** Three UI versions (v0.1.1, v0.1.2, v0.1.3) shipped in a single session following IFD methodology. This is the first time the project has produced a multi-version sequence where every previous version is preserved, independently accessible, and rollback-capable.

**What shipped:**

| Version | Capability Added | Key Architectural Choice |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| v0.1.1 | Hash-fragment URLs (single-link sharing), GA removed | D014 implemented, D024 implemented |
| v0.1.2 | Text input mode, auto-decrypt, SGMETA metadata | D020 implemented |
| v0.1.3 | i18n foundation (4 languages, 80+ strings, locale selector) | D017 implemented |

**Why this matters for the historical record:**
- Validates IFD as a practical methodology, not just a theoretical preference. Three versions shipped, zero regressions reported, all coexisting at distinct URL paths.
- Establishes the cadence: each version adds one major capability while inheriting everything from the previous version.
- Creates the first real rollback safety net. If v0.1.3 had a critical bug in production, the system could point back to v0.1.2 or v0.1.1 by changing a pointer. This was never possible before because v0.1.0 was the only version.

**IFD compliance verification:** All three versions exist side by side under `sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__user/v0/v0.1/`. The original v0.1.0 remains untouched. D031 (IFD non-negotiable) was formally adopted during this session and retroactively satisfied by the implementation.

### M005: First Multilingual Release

**Date:** 13 February 2026
**Significance:** SGraph Send is now available in 4 languages: English (`en`), Portuguese - Brasil (`pt`), Portuguese - Portugal (`pt-PT`), and Klingon (`tlh`). This is the project's first i18n release.

**Architecture established:**
- Event-driven component re-rendering on language change
- JSON locale files (`i18n/*.json`) with 80+ translated strings per language
- `i18n.js` module providing the translation infrastructure
- Language selector with flag-based visual indicators

**Strategic significance:**
- The Portuguese variants (Brasil + Portugal) prove the system handles regional dialect differentiation. This is the hard problem in i18n -- not adding languages, but distinguishing regional variants of the same language.
- Klingon (`tlh`) proves the architecture handles any language, including constructed ones with non-Latin script conventions. If it works for Klingon, it works for Arabic, Japanese, or any language that follows.
- The i18n foundation was shipped *before* major UI content expansion (per D017), preventing the hardcoded string debt that plagues most projects.

---

### M006: Google Analytics Removal (First Strategic Reversal)

**Date:** 13 February 2026
**Significance:** Google Analytics was removed from all pages in v0.1.1. This is the first time the project has deliberately reversed a prior technology integration.

**Decision chain:**
```
(Pre-D001)  GA integrated informally (no decision record, no rationale)
     |
D016        Single GA4 property shared across domains (launch-day decision)
     |
D024        GA removed entirely. Server-side analytics via cache service.
```

**Why this matters for the historical record:**
- First explicit strategic reversal in the project (tracked as D024).
- Demonstrates the team's ability to adopt, evaluate, and reject technology based on experience rather than sunk cost. The project lead described GA as "a useful experiment -- it reminded me how much Google Analytics sucks."
- Triggers a cascade: D024 (remove GA) enables D025 (no-cookie policy), which becomes a market differentiator. A removal decision created more value than the original addition.
- The original GA integration had no decision ID. D024 is the first time an informal choice was formally reversed. The Historian's recommendation (from the Brief #2 review) that significant integrations receive decision IDs remains relevant.

**Note on decision numbering:** The launch-day status report (`v0.2.24__status-report__post-launch.md`) assigned D016 to "Single GA4 property shared across domains." The daily brief #1 response later assigned D016 to "CORS handled by osbot-fast-api." The wrap-up debrief canonicalises D014--D033 using the daily brief numbering. The launch-day D014--D020 represent an earlier numbering epoch from the same date. For the canonical record, this review follows the wrap-up debrief's numbering.

---

### M007: First Public Social Media Showcase

**Date:** 13 February 2026
**Significance:** The project lead posted publicly on LinkedIn, showcasing the multilingual MVP with screenshots in all 4 languages, including Klingon.

**Post:** https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7428147910451638272/

**Why this matters for the historical record:**
- First public product showcase with real UI screenshots (not mockups, not descriptions).
- The Klingon angle is deliberately memorable. It demonstrates technical capability (i18n architecture works for *any* language) while being inherently shareable. This is marketing as engineering proof.
- The Portuguese variants signal international readiness to a professional audience.
- Marks the transition from "building in private" to "building in public." The project now has an external audience observing its evolution.

**Precedent set:** Public announcements can now be tied to shipped milestones. The pattern is: ship a version, then announce it with evidence. Not: announce intent, then try to deliver.

---

### M008: Sherpa Role First Activation

**Date:** 13 February 2026
**Significance:** The Sherpa role -- responsible for user journey observation, friction detection, and trail-based analytics -- produced its first deliverables after being defined on 12 February 2026 (one day dormant).

**Deliverables produced:**

| Document | Key Output |
|----------|-----------|
| First-Time User Journey Map & Friction Log | 13 friction points mapped (3 HIGH, 5 MEDIUM, 5 LOW). Sender flow (7 stages) and recipient flow (4 stages) fully mapped. |
| Trail Observation Plan | 48 telemetry events defined across 4 trail types. 6 primary metrics, 6 abandonment metrics. Zero-cookie compliant. |
| Response to Daily Briefs #1 & #2 | Token onboarding trail, domain preference research, event data UX, sharing method tracking. |

**Why this matters for the historical record:**
- Fastest role activation in the project. Defined on 12 Feb, dormant for one day, activated on 13 Feb with 3 comprehensive documents.
- The Sherpa's friction log immediately connected to shipped work: Friction F002 (split-channel sharing) was already partially resolved by v0.1.1's hash-fragment URLs (D014). This is the first time a role's analysis retroactively validated a decision made by another role in the same session.
- The 48 telemetry events are blocked on the cache service (D026), creating the first explicit cross-role dependency chain: Sherpa (events designed) --> Architect (cache service schema) --> Dev (implementation) --> Sherpa (observation begins).
- Sets the pattern for future role activations: a dormant role produces foundational documents on first activation, then enters an ongoing observation mode.

---

### M009: First "Brief --> Implement --> Ship --> Announce" Same-Day Cycle

**Date:** 13 February 2026
**Significance:** The complete cycle from human brief to public announcement completed within a single calendar day. This is the fastest end-to-end cycle in the project's history.

**Timeline of the cycle:**

```
Morning     Brief #1 lands (first-user feedback, UX priorities)
            10 role responses produced
            Brief #2 lands (GA removal, cache service, zero cookies)
            9 role responses produced
            Sherpa activated (3 documents)
Afternoon   v0.1.1 shipped (hash-fragment URLs, GA removed)
            v0.1.2 shipped (text input, auto-decrypt)
            v0.1.3 shipped (i18n, 4 languages)
            7 bug fixes shipped
Evening     LinkedIn post published (public announcement)
```

**Why this matters for the historical record:**
- Previous cycles were multi-day. The infrastructure brief (08 Feb) produced responses on 10 Feb and shipped on 12 Feb -- a 4-day cycle. This session compressed the equivalent to a single day.
- The compression was enabled by: (a) the IFD methodology allowing incremental shipping without risk, (b) the in-memory stack starting in ~100ms enabling rapid iteration, (c) the role system producing parallel analysis that unblocked implementation quickly.
- The public announcement at the end is not incidental. It closes the loop: the team shipped something they were confident enough to show publicly. This is the difference between "done" and "shipped."
- Establishes a velocity benchmark for future sessions.

## 2. Session Pattern Analysis

### Pattern 1: Brief-to-Ship Velocity (Same-Day Cycle)

**Observation:** Two briefs were received, processed by 22 role responses, implemented across 3 UI versions with 7 bug fixes, and publicly announced -- all on 13 February 2026.

**Historical comparison:**

| Cycle | Brief Date | Ship Date | Announce Date | Duration |
|-------|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Infrastructure sprint | 08 Feb | 12 Feb | 12 Feb (domain live) | 4 days |
| v0.1.3 session | 13 Feb | 13 Feb | 13 Feb (LinkedIn) | Same day |

**What accelerated the cycle:**
1. **IFD methodology** -- each version is additive, not destructive. No need for extensive regression testing before shipping.
2. **In-memory stack** -- the test infrastructure starts in ~100ms. No waiting for containers, databases, or services.
3. **Parallel role analysis** -- 10 roles respond simultaneously. The Dev does not wait for the Architect to finish; they produce concurrent analysis and the Conductor sequences implementation.
4. **Scope discipline** -- each version adds exactly one major capability. v0.1.1 = hash-fragment URLs. v0.1.2 = text input. v0.1.3 = i18n. No scope creep within versions.

**Risk to monitor:** Same-day cycles may create pressure to skip analysis steps. The 22 role responses took time to produce; if the team optimises for speed over thoroughness, quality may degrade. The Historian recommends that same-day cycles remain the exception (when changes are well-understood and incremental), not the expectation.

---

### Pattern 2: IFD Methodology in Practice (3 Versions, Zero Regressions)

**Observation:** Three UI versions shipped sequentially. Each builds on the previous. All previous versions remain independently accessible. No regressions reported.

**Evidence of IFD compliance:**
- v0.1.0 (original) untouched
- v0.1.1 inherits from v0.1.0, adds hash-fragment URLs, removes GA
- v0.1.2 inherits from v0.1.1, adds text input and auto-decrypt
- v0.1.3 inherits from v0.1.2, adds i18n foundation
- All versions at distinct URL paths under `sgraph_ai_app_send__ui__user/v0/v0.1/`

**Named pattern:** "Additive versioning." Each version is a superset of the previous. Nothing is removed or overwritten. Rollback is path-switching, not code-reverting.

**Historical significance:** This is the first empirical validation of IFD in the project. D031 (IFD non-negotiable) was adopted during this session, but the methodology was already being followed before the formal policy. The policy formalised observed practice, not theoretical intent.

**Structural observation:** IFD creates a growing disk footprint (each version is a full copy). At 3 versions this is trivial. At 30 versions it may need a consolidation strategy (major version roll-ups). The Historian flags this as a long-term consideration, not a current concern.

---

### Pattern 3: Strategic Reversal Pattern (D024 -- GA Added Then Removed)

**Observation:** Google Analytics was integrated informally (pre-D001), used briefly, evaluated, and removed (D024). The removal created more value than the addition: it enabled D025 (no-cookie policy), which became a market differentiator.

**Named pattern:** "Productive reversal." A technology decision is reversed, but the reversal is not a waste -- it produces a stronger position than never having made the original decision. The team now knows *from experience* that GA is incompatible with their values, rather than theorising about it.

**Decision chain with value creation:**
```
(Pre-D001)  GA added       --> baseline analytics capability
D016        GA formalised  --> cross-domain tracking
D024        GA removed     --> zero third-party data sharing
D025        No-cookie      --> market differentiator (competitive advantage)
```

Each step in the chain increased the project's strategic clarity. The reversal at D024 was the inflection point.

**Comparison with other reversals:** D024 is the project's only strategic reversal to date. Previous decisions (D001--D023) were either new decisions, refinements, or deferrals. None were reversals. The fact that the first reversal was handled cleanly -- with documented rationale, formal decision ID, and explicit supersession of the informal prior decision -- sets a healthy precedent.

---

### Pattern 4: Role Activation Pattern (Sherpa Dormant to Active)

**Observation:** The Sherpa role was defined on 12 February 2026 alongside the Advocate and Ambassador roles. Sherpa activated on 13 February with 3 comprehensive documents. Advocate and Ambassador remain dormant.

**Activation timeline for all roles:**

| Role | Defined | First Output | Dormancy |
|------|---------|-------------|----------|
| Conductor | Pre-v0.1.4 | 08 Feb | 0 days |
| Architect | Pre-v0.1.4 | 08 Feb | 0 days |
| Dev | Pre-v0.1.4 | 08 Feb | 0 days |
| QA | Pre-v0.1.4 | 08 Feb | 0 days |
| DevOps | Pre-v0.1.4 | 08 Feb | 0 days |
| Librarian | Pre-v0.1.4 | 08 Feb | 0 days |
| Cartographer | Pre-v0.1.4 | 08 Feb | 0 days |
| AppSec | Pre-v0.1.4 | 08 Feb | 0 days |
| Historian | Pre-v0.1.4 | 08 Feb | 0 days |
| Journalist | Pre-v0.1.4 | 08 Feb | 0 days |
| DPO | 12 Feb | 13 Feb | 1 day |
| Sherpa | 12 Feb | 13 Feb | 1 day |
| Advocate | 12 Feb | -- | Dormant |
| Ambassador | 12 Feb | -- | Dormant |

**Named pattern:** "Demand-triggered activation." Roles activate when a brief creates demand for their specific expertise. Sherpa activated because Brief #1 contained first-user friction data. DPO activated because Brief #2 required a formal privacy recommendation on GA removal. Advocate and Ambassador remain dormant because no brief has yet required external advocacy or partnership outreach.

**Prediction:** Ambassador will activate when the LinkedIn post generates engagement requiring follow-up. Advocate will activate when a self-hosted deployment brief lands. Both are waiting for their trigger event.

---

### Pattern 5: LinkedIn Post as Milestone Marker

**Observation:** The session ended with a public LinkedIn post. This is the first time a shipped milestone has been immediately followed by public announcement.

**Named pattern:** "Ship-then-show." The announcement is the final step of the delivery cycle, not a separate marketing activity. The post contains real screenshots of the shipped product, not mockups or promises. This creates accountability: the team has publicly committed to the state of the product as shown.

**Historical significance:** This pattern changes the project's relationship with its audience. Before M007, the project had no public audience. After M007, every subsequent milestone can be measured against the public benchmark set by the LinkedIn post. The team can no longer silently regress -- the Klingon UI is on record.

---

## 3. Decision Evolution

### Cumulative Decision Log (D014--D033)

The wrap-up debrief canonicalises 20 decisions made during the 13 February session. The following table tracks each decision's current implementation status.

| ID | Decision | Status | Implementation Evidence |
|----|----------|--------|----------------------|
| D014 | Hash-fragment URLs approved | **IMPLEMENTED** | v0.1.1 `send-upload.js`, `send-download.js` |
| D015 | Rate limiting deferred | Accepted | No implementation needed (deliberate deferral) |
| D016 | CORS handled by osbot-fast-api | Confirmed | Framework-level, no additional code |
| D017 | i18n before new UI content | **IMPLEMENTED** | v0.1.3 `i18n.js`, 4 locale files |
| D018 | Observability Tier 1 | Ready to action | Blocked on DevOps execution |
| D019 | Admin tokens: query string by design | Architectural choice | No UI implementation yet |
| D020 | Text input: same AES-256-GCM pipeline | **IMPLEMENTED** | v0.1.2 `send-upload.js` |
| D021 | Five themes (CSS-variable based) | Planned | No implementation yet |
| D022 | Separate S3 bucket for observability | Planned | No implementation yet |
| D023 | Milestone M003: first real user | Recorded | Historical record only |
| D024 | Google Analytics removed | **IMPLEMENTED** | v0.1.1 -- GA script tags removed from all pages |
| D025 | No-Cookie Policy | **ACTIVE** | Zero cookies verified in shipped versions |
| D026 | Cache service as central data backbone | Architecture delivered | Schema designed, not yet coded |
| D027 | LETS pipeline (on-demand, cascading save) | Architecture delivered | Pattern defined, not yet coded |
| D028 | Human-friendly tokens via cache hash | Architecture delivered | Schema designed, not yet coded |
| D029 | Token usage limits | Architecture delivered | Schema designed, not yet coded |
| D030 | Local storage transparency panel | Planned | No implementation yet |
| D031 | IFD non-negotiable (merge gate) | **POLICY** | Enforced retroactively by v0.1.1--v0.1.3 compliance |
| D032 | Admin UI first for modular architecture | Planned | No implementation yet |
| D033 | AWS cost tracking from day one | Planned | No implementation yet |

### Implementation Velocity

| Category | Count | IDs |
|----------|-------|-----|
| **Implemented** (code shipped) | 5 | D014, D017, D020, D024, D025 |
| **Active policy** (enforced, no code needed) | 1 | D031 |
| **Architecture delivered** (schema/design complete, code pending) | 4 | D026, D027, D028, D029 |
| **Confirmed/Accepted** (no action needed) | 3 | D015, D016, D023 |
| **Planned** (not yet designed or implemented) | 5 | D018, D021, D022, D030, D032, D033 |
| **Architectural choice** (design decision, implementation later) | 1 | D019 |

**Implementation rate:** 5 of 20 decisions implemented in the same session they were made (25%). If we include D025 (active policy) and D031 (enforced policy), the "actioned" rate rises to 7 of 20 (35%).

**Velocity observation:** All 5 implemented decisions belong to the UI version sequence (D014 in v0.1.1, D024 in v0.1.1, D020 in v0.1.2, D017 in v0.1.3, D025 as a consequence of D024). The decisions that shipped are exactly those that could be implemented in the browser without backend changes. The 4 "architecture delivered" decisions (D026--D029) all require backend work (cache service). This reveals the current bottleneck: **frontend decisions ship same-day; backend decisions queue for the next sprint.**

### Cumulative Decision Statistics (D001--D033)

| Brief / Session | Decisions | Range | Implemented Same-Session |
|-----------------|-----------|-------|-------------------------|
| Infrastructure brief (08 Feb) | 13 | D001--D013 | Various (tracked in prior reviews) |
| Daily Brief #1 (13 Feb) | 10 | D014--D023 | 3 (D014, D017, D020) |
| Daily Brief #2 (13 Feb) | 10 | D024--D033 | 2 (D024, D025) |
| **Total** | **33** | D001--D033 | **5 this session** |

### Decision Numbering Note

The launch-day status report (`v0.2.24__status-report__post-launch.md`) assigned D014--D020 to a set of launch-day operational decisions (API key middleware, access token, GA4 property, LaunchList, root path routing, docs URL, Jekyll config). These were subsequently renumbered when the daily brief #1 response assigned D014--D023 to the brief's architectural decisions. The wrap-up debrief canonicalises D014--D033 using the daily brief numbering. The launch-day decisions from the status report should be considered part of the pre-D014 operational history, not the formal decision log. The Historian recommends that future numbering conflicts be avoided by reserving decision IDs at the start of each session.

## 4. Session Statistics Archive

The following statistics are archived from the wrap-up debrief for historical comparison with future sessions.

### 13 February 2026 -- v0.1.3 Session

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Daily briefs processed | 2 | Brief #1 (first-user feedback), Brief #2 (GA removal, cache service) |
| Role responses produced | 22 | 10 (Brief #1) + 9 (Brief #2) + 3 (Sherpa activation) |
| UI versions shipped | 3 | v0.1.1, v0.1.2, v0.1.3 |
| Languages live | 4 | English, PT-BR, PT-PT, Klingon |
| Bug fixes shipped | 7 | Text 0-byte, auto-decrypt, SGMETA, drop zone, language selector, hash-change, open-in-new-tab |
| Decisions logged | 20 | D014--D033 |
| Decisions implemented same-session | 5 | D014, D017, D020, D024, D025 |
| Friction points identified | 13 | By Sherpa (3 HIGH, 5 MEDIUM, 5 LOW) |
| Telemetry events designed | 48 | By Sherpa (sender, recipient, token, system trails) |
| New lines of code | 4,573 | Across 22 files (18 UI, 3 Sherpa docs, 1 debrief) |
| New files created | 22 | 18 UI files, 3 Sherpa documents, 1 debrief |
| LinkedIn posts | 1 | First public i18n showcase |
| Debriefs produced | 3 | Brief #1 responses, Brief #2 responses, session wrap-up |
| Milestones recorded | 6 | M004--M009 |
| Roles activated | 2 | Sherpa (first activation), DPO (brief #2 response) |
| Roles still dormant | 2 | Advocate, Ambassador |
| Open questions raised | 4 | Q001--Q004 (from Brief #2 review) |
| Named patterns identified | 10 | 4 (Brief #1) + 5 (Brief #2) + 5 (this wrap-up) -- some overlap |

### Comparative Baseline

| Metric | Infrastructure Sprint (08--12 Feb) | v0.1.3 Session (13 Feb) | Delta |
|--------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| Duration | 4 days | 1 day | -75% |
| Briefs processed | 1 | 2 | +100% |
| Role responses | 8 | 22 | +175% |
| UI versions shipped | 1 (v0.1.0) | 3 (v0.1.1--v0.1.3) | +200% |
| Decisions logged | 13 | 20 | +54% |
| Public announcements | 0 | 1 | First |

The v0.1.3 session produced nearly 3x the output of the infrastructure sprint in 25% of the time. This is partly explained by the infrastructure sprint building foundations that the v0.1.3 session could leverage, and partly by the increasing maturity of the role system enabling parallel work.

## 6. Cumulative Milestone Registry

| ID | Milestone | Date | Recorded In |
|----|-----------|------|-------------|
| M001 | First deployment (Lambda + domain) | 2026-02-12 | Status report (post-launch) |
| M002 | Domain live (`send.sgraph.ai`) | 2026-02-12 | Status report (post-launch) |
| M003 | First real user test | 2026-02-12 | Brief #1 response |
| M004 | First IFD-compliant UI version sequence (v0.1.1--v0.1.3) | 2026-02-13 | This review |
| M005 | First multilingual release (4 languages) | 2026-02-13 | This review |
| M006 | Google Analytics removal (first strategic reversal) | 2026-02-13 | This review |
| M007 | First public social media showcase (LinkedIn) | 2026-02-13 | This review |
| M008 | Sherpa role first activation | 2026-02-13 | This review |
| M009 | First same-day brief-to-ship-to-announce cycle | 2026-02-13 | This review |

Six milestones in a single day. The project recorded 3 milestones across the first 4 days (M001--M003) and 6 milestones on day 5 (M004--M009). This acceleration reflects the transition from infrastructure building (slow, foundational) to feature shipping (fast, incremental).
