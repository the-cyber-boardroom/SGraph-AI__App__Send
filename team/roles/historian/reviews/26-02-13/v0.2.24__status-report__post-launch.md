## 1. Decisions Logged: 13 February 2026

| # | Decision | Made By | Rationale | Supersedes |
|---|----------|---------|-----------|------------|
| D014 | Disable global API key middleware; use per-route access token auth instead | Conductor | Global middleware blocked health checks and public download endpoints. Per-route auth allows granular control over which routes require the token. | Previous: global middleware approach |
| D015 | Access token as single env var (`SGRAPH_SEND__ACCESS_TOKEN`) shared across all authorised users | Conductor | Simplest viable auth for friendlies phase. One token, one env var, no database. Token checked via `x-sgraph-access-token` header. | Previous: `SGRAPH_SEND_ADMIN_KEY` (admin-only) |
| D016 | Single GA4 property shared across `send.sgraph.ai` and `docs.send.sgraph.ai` | Conductor | Unified analytics view. Both domains serve the same product. Cross-domain tracking via shared property ID. | New decision |
| D017 | LaunchList selected for waitlist/early access signup | Conductor | External platform (aligns with D007 -- Register Interest moved to external). Minimal integration effort (embed widget). | D007 refined (platform now selected) |
| D018 | Root path (`/`) serves access-gated landing page with redirect to `/send` on auth | Conductor | Prevents unauthenticated users from seeing the upload UI. Creates a clean entry point. | New decision |
| D019 | `docs.send.sgraph.ai` as documentation URL (Jekyll on GitHub Pages) | Conductor | Extends D013 (Jekyll approved). Subdomain keeps docs associated with the product domain. GitHub Pages provides free, low-maintenance hosting. | D013 refined (URL now decided) |
| D020 | `future: true` in Jekyll `_config.yml` | Conductor | Allows publishing articles with future dates for scheduled content. Pragmatic for a small team publishing ahead of time. | New decision |

## 2. Pattern Analysis

### 2.1 Pragmatic Shortcuts

Every decision today follows the same pattern: **choose the fastest path to get the product in front of friendlies.**

- D014/D015: Simplest auth that works (shared secret, no user management).
- D016: One GA property instead of separate tracking per domain.
- D017: External waitlist instead of building one.
- D018: Gating via token on root, not a proper auth system.
- D019/D020: GitHub Pages instead of custom hosting.

This is deliberate. The Conductor's brief (v0.1.4) prioritised speed to friendlies over architectural completeness.

### 2.2 Velocity Observation

The project moved from "infrastructure sprint" (v0.1.4 brief, 10 Feb) to "live with real users" (13 Feb) in 3 days. The master roadmap (v0.1.1 phase overview) did not predict this pace. The pragmatic shortcut pattern is the primary accelerant.

### 2.3 Debt Created

Each shortcut creates explicit debt:

| Decision | Debt | When to Pay |
|----------|------|-------------|
| D015 | Single shared token has no audit trail, no revocation per user | Before public launch |
| D016 | Shared GA property may need separation if domains diverge in purpose | If docs becomes a separate product |
| D017 | LaunchList DPA and privacy terms not yet reviewed | Before wider data collection |
| D020 | `future: true` could publish drafts accidentally if dates are wrong | Ongoing editorial discipline |

| Q002 | When to switch to pre-signed URLs | Still open |
| Q003 | Admin auth: single key or per-user | Deferred (D015 chose single key for now) |
| Q004 | GCS native backend priority | Still open |
| Q005 | CLI encryption library choice | Still open |
| Q006 | Cookie consent mechanism for GA (DPO raised) | **New -- P0** |
| Q007 | Privacy policy content and location | **New -- P0** |
