## 1. Decision Log -- New Decisions (D024--D033)

| ID | Decision | Date | Rationale | Made By | Supersedes |
|----|----------|------|-----------|---------|------------|
| D024 | **Google Analytics removed from site** | 2026-02-13 | GA breaks the zero-tracking promise, sends data to Google (third-party processing, international transfer), forces cookie consent infrastructure, adds GDPR complexity, and provides only client-side data that can be gamed. Replaced by server-side analytics via the cache service. | Human (project lead) | Supersedes the earlier decision to add GA (implicit -- GA was integrated pre-D001 without a formal decision record) |
| D025 | **No-Cookie Policy adopted** -- "This site uses no cookies. None." | 2026-02-13 | With GA removed and no other cookie-setting technology in the stack, the site can make a provable zero-cookie claim. Eliminates PECR/ePrivacy compliance overhead for cookies. Eliminates need for cookie consent banners. Simplifies privacy posture to a single, verifiable statement. | Human (project lead) | -- |
| D026 | **Cache service is the central data backbone** -- built on Memory-FS | 2026-02-13 | The cache service introduces Cache ID (unique gravity per entry resolving to a file tree), Cache Hash (human-meaningful lookup resolving to Cache ID), and Temporal Storage (date-path + latest). Underpins: file storage, token management, site analytics, event logging, cost tracking. Chosen because Memory-FS is already in the stack, the abstraction scales across all deployment targets, and a single storage pattern avoids fragmentation across concerns. | Human (project lead), Architect (design) | Refines the observability pipeline design from Brief #1 ("collect -> S3 -> visualise") into a specific technology layer |
| D027 | **LETS principle adopted** -- Load, Extract, Transform, Save | 2026-02-13 | Every request writes a file. Every query saves its result. Aggregations cascade: 30min -> hourly -> daily -> monthly. Read-optimised: dashboards read pre-computed aggregations, never reprocess raw files. Scales from 100 to 100,000 requests/day with the same pattern. | Human (project lead) | -- |
| D028 | **Human-friendly tokens** -- memorable names, not GUIDs | 2026-02-13 | Tokens use names like "community-x", "football-123", "beta-2025". Token name is hashed to produce a cache hash, which resolves to a cache ID. Human-friendly tokens are more shareable, more memorable, and support brand-building for community partnerships. | Human (project lead) | Extends D018 (token URLs use query string) with the resolution mechanism |
| D029 | **Token usage limits** -- each token has a finite allocation | 2026-02-13 | Each token has a usage limit (5, 10, 100, 1000, etc.). The cache entry stores usage count vs limit. When the limit is reached, the token is exhausted. Foundation for the commercial model: credits, budgets, per-community quotas all follow this pattern. "We're not building billing yet, but we're building the infrastructure billing will sit on." | Human (project lead) | -- |
| D030 | **Local storage transparency panel** -- users see exactly what the browser stores | 2026-02-13 | A UI panel shows the user everything stored in browser local storage. Key caching is optional (user chooses). Zero-storage mode available (nothing saved, fully stateless session). Transparency panel makes the privacy promise verifiable at the client level. "Like opening the hood of a car." | Human (project lead) | -- |
| D031 | **IFD methodology is non-negotiable for all UI work** | 2026-02-13 | All client-side changes must follow Iterative Flow Development. Never override existing HTML. Each change creates a new version. Previous versions remain accessible. Minor versions reuse and extend. Major versions consolidate. Every change has a version number. PRs that do not follow IFD do not merge. | Human (project lead) | Formalises existing IFD guidance into an enforceable policy |
| D032 | **Admin UI first for modular event-driven architecture** | 2026-02-13 | The event-driven, multi-module, dynamically loaded UI ships on the admin side first. Admin needs the most flexibility (dashboards, token management, analytics, event logs). Faster iteration without user-facing polish constraints. Once working on admin, modules selectively migrate to the user-facing UI. | Human (project lead) | -- |
| D033 | **AWS cost tracking from day one via LETS pipeline** | 2026-02-13 | AWS cost data collected via the same collector pattern. Stored in cache service. Aggregations: daily, weekly, monthly. Correlated with traffic to produce unit economics: cost per request, cost per transfer, cost per active user. Provides unit economics visibility before scaling. | Human (project lead) | -- |

## 2. Decision Supersession Map

D024 is the first explicit strategic reversal in the project. The decision chain:

```
(Pre-D001)  GA integrated into the site (no formal decision record)
     |
     v
D024        GA removed. Server-side analytics via cache service replaces it.
```

This is worth noting because the original GA integration was made informally (no decision ID, no recorded rationale). D024 is the first time a previous informal choice has been formally reversed with a documented rationale. The Historian recommends that significant technology integrations -- even "just adding a script tag" -- receive decision IDs going forward.

D026 refines the Brief #1 observability pipeline ("collect -> S3 -> visualise") into a specific technology pattern. This is not a contradiction but an evolution: the general principle survives, the implementation is now defined.

D028 extends D018 (tokens in query strings). D018 established that tokens go in the query string (visible to server). D028 adds the resolution mechanism (hash -> cache hash -> cache ID) and the human-friendly naming requirement. No contradiction; D028 builds on D018.

D031 formalises existing IFD guidance. Previous references to IFD were advisory; D031 makes compliance a merge gate. This is an escalation from guidance to enforcement.

## 3. Decision Patterns

### Pattern A: Strategic Reversal

D024 is the project's first deliberate reversal. The team added Google Analytics, used it, evaluated it, and removed it. This is a healthy pattern -- it demonstrates the team can adopt, evaluate, and reject technology based on experience rather than sunk cost. The reversal was driven by a concrete finding: GA's cookie requirement contradicts the product's privacy promise.

**Named pattern:** "Adopt-evaluate-reverse." GA was added as an experiment. The experiment produced a clear result: GA is incompatible with the product's values. The reversal is not a failure; it is the experiment completing.

### Pattern B: Gravitational Centralisation

D026 (cache service as data backbone) represents a single component becoming central to every major concern: storage, tokens, analytics, events, cost tracking. This is the most architecturally significant decision since the project started.

**Named pattern:** "Gravity component." The cache service is becoming the gravitational centre of the system. Everything resolves to a cache entry. This creates enormous leverage (one pattern for everything) but also concentration risk (if the cache service has a design flaw, it affects everything). The Architect should monitor for over-coupling.

**Historical parallel:** In Brief #1, Memory-FS was already the storage abstraction. D026 elevates it from "storage layer" to "data backbone." The transition from infrastructure to application gravity happened in a single brief.

### Pattern C: Privacy as Product Feature

D024 (remove GA), D025 (no-cookie policy), and D030 (transparency panel) form a coherent cluster where privacy compliance concerns are being reframed as product features:

- No cookies is not just a compliance simplification; it is a market differentiator (D025).
- The transparency panel is not just a GDPR disclosure; it is a trust feature (D030).
- Removing GA is not just reducing third-party risk; it is strengthening the product promise (D024).

**Named pattern:** "Compliance-to-feature." The team is systematically converting privacy compliance obligations into competitive advantages. This is a deliberate strategic choice, not an accidental side effect.

### Pattern D: Infrastructure-Before-Billing

D029 (token usage limits) and D033 (AWS cost tracking) build billing infrastructure before any billing system exists. Usage limits are prototypes of paid plans. Cost-per-transfer is unit economics for pricing decisions.

**Named pattern:** "Foundation before facade." Build the measurement infrastructure first, gather data, then build the billing UI and pricing model on top of real numbers. This prevents the common mistake of setting prices based on guesswork.

### Pattern E: Scope Expansion via Abstraction

Brief #2 expands scope significantly (cache service, LETS pipeline, cost tracking, transparency panel, modular admin UI) but does so through abstraction rather than addition. The cache service is one component that serves five concerns. LETS is one pattern applied to multiple data flows. This is scope expansion disguised as simplification.

**Named pattern:** "Expand through abstraction." The surface area of responsibility grows, but the number of distinct patterns stays small. This is sustainable scope expansion -- unless the abstractions leak.

## 4. Open Questions

| ID | Question | Raised By | Date | Affects | Status |
|----|----------|-----------|------|---------|--------|
| Q001 | Does the cache hash algorithm guarantee collision-free resolution for human-friendly token names? | Historian (inference from D028) | 2026-02-13 | Token system reliability | Open -- Architect to confirm |
| Q002 | What happens when the cache service has a design flaw that affects all concerns simultaneously (storage, tokens, analytics, events, cost)? | Historian (pattern B risk) | 2026-02-13 | System resilience | Open -- Architect to assess concentration risk |
| Q003 | How does LETS pipeline scheduling work -- on-demand, scheduled, or triggered? Brief #2 describes the cascade but not the trigger mechanism. | Historian (inference from D027) | 2026-02-13 | Analytics pipeline implementation | Open -- Architect to design |
| Q004 | What is the migration path if Memory-FS needs to be replaced as the cache service backend? | Historian (gravitational centralisation risk) | 2026-02-13 | Architecture flexibility | Open -- Architect to confirm pluggability |

## 5. Spec Change Tracking

| Original Spec | Section | Current Decision | Change | Changed By | When | Why |
|---------------|---------|------------------|--------|-----------|------|-----|
| `01-project-brief.md` | Analytics / observability | D024, D026, D027 | Original spec did not specify an analytics approach. GA was added informally. Brief #2 replaces it with a fully specified server-side analytics system (cache service + LETS). | Human (project lead) | 2026-02-13 | GA incompatible with zero-tracking promise; server-side analytics provides accurate, cookie-free data |
| `01-project-brief.md` | Token system | D028, D029 | Original spec described invitation tokens. Brief #2 adds human-friendly naming, cache-hash resolution, and usage limits. Tokens evolve from simple access keys to proto-billing instruments. | Human (project lead) | 2026-02-13 | Commercial model foundation; better UX for community partnerships |
| `01-project-brief.md` | UI methodology | D031 | Original spec did not mandate a specific UI development methodology. Brief #2 makes IFD non-negotiable with merge-gate enforcement. | Human (project lead) | 2026-02-13 | Prevent UI version drift; ensure rollback capability |

## 7. Contradiction Check

### D024 vs Brief #1 (GA data collection)

Brief #1 Task Summary included "Pull Google Analytics data into S3 collection" as a P3 task. D024 removes GA entirely. This is an **intentional supersession**, not an accidental contradiction. Brief #2 explicitly states: "Adding Google Analytics to the site was a useful experiment -- it reminded me how much Google Analytics sucks." The P3 task from Brief #1 is now void.

### D026 vs D019 (separate S3 bucket for observability)

D019 (from Brief #1) established that observability data goes in a separate S3 bucket from transfer storage. D026 introduces the cache service as the data backbone for analytics. These are not contradictory if the cache service's Memory-FS backend for analytics resolves to the separate S3 bucket when running on AWS. However, the Architect should confirm that the cache service respects the D019 security boundary. **Flagged for Architect review.**

### No other contradictions detected.
