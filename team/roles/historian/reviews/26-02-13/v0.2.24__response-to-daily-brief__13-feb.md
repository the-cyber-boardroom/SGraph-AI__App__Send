## 1. Milestone Record

### M003: First Real User Test

**Date:** 12 February 2026
**Significance:** First external user tested the live MVP at `send.sgraph.ai`

**Outcome:** Positive. User completed the end-to-end flow (upload → encrypt → share → download → decrypt). Reaction: "this is quite useful, this is cool."

**Friction observed:**
- Page didn't explain what the service does
- Too many manual steps (copy link + copy key separately)
- Domain `.ai` created confusion about AI involvement

**Impact:** Directly drives the P1 priorities in this daily brief (hash-fragment URLs, text input, explanatory content).

## 2. Decision Log — New Decisions

Continuing from D001–D013 (v0.2.1) and subsequent decisions.

| ID | Decision | Date | Rationale | Made By |
|----|----------|------|-----------|---------|
| D014 | **Hash-fragment approach approved** for combined link+key URLs | 2026-02-13 | Architect + AppSec confirm hash fragment never leaves client. Zero-knowledge maintained. UX simplified from 2 copy actions to 1. | Architect, AppSec (review); User (directive) |
| D015 | **Rate limiting deferred** until observability pipeline provides traffic visualisation | 2026-02-13 | Cannot set meaningful thresholds without usage data. Correct sequence: observe → understand → limit. | User (directive) |
| D016 | **CORS confirmed handled by osbot-fast-api** framework | 2026-02-13 | `Serverless__Fast_API` includes CORS middleware. No additional work needed. Verify in smoke tests. | User (directive) |
| D017 | **i18n required before new UI content** — all new strings go through translation layer | 2026-02-13 | Prevents hardcoded string debt. Content authored as i18n keys from day one. Architectural urgency increases with each new UI element. | Architect (design); Conductor (sequencing) |
| D018 | **Token URLs use query string** (not hash fragment) — server visibility is the feature | 2026-02-13 | Opposite of encryption key handling. Backend must see token to track activation. Format: `?token={id}`. | Architect (design) |
| D019 | **Observability S3 bucket separate from transfer storage** | 2026-02-13 | Security boundary: logs/analytics data in dedicated bucket. Prevents accidental access to transfer blobs via analytics pipeline. | AppSec (recommendation) |
| D020 | **Five theme variants defined** — Dark, High Contrast, Aurora, Glacier, Ember | 2026-02-13 | Accessibility (dark, high-contrast) + brand differentiation (Aurora, Glacier, Ember). CSS-variable-based switching. | User (brief) |
| D021 | **Text input feature approved** alongside file upload | 2026-02-13 | Lowers barrier for first-time testing ("hello world"). Enables password/credential sharing use case. Same encryption pipeline. | User (brief, from first user observation) |
| D022 | **Email sharing: copy-text + Gmail compose** as sharing options | 2026-02-13 | Viral loop touchpoint. Every shared email is potential user acquisition. Ambassador to optimise. | User (brief) |
| D023 | **Start with English (en) + Portuguese (pt)** for i18n | 2026-02-13 | Portuguese is project lead's second language. Proves the i18n system works before adding more languages. | User (brief) |

## 3. Decision Patterns Observed

### Pattern: User Feedback Driving Architecture
First real user test directly led to D014 (hash-fragment), D021 (text input), and the landing page content priority. This is the first time external feedback has driven architectural decisions — a healthy signal that the team is listening to users, not just building internally.

### Pattern: Deliberate Deferral
D015 (rate limiting deferred) and the overall approach of "observe before constraining" shows maturity. The team is resisting the urge to add defences before understanding the threat landscape. This aligns with AppSec's recommendation to build observability first.

### Pattern: Symmetric Design Choices
D014 (key in hash, hidden from server) and D018 (token in query string, visible to server) are mirror decisions. Same URL, opposite requirements. This shows the team understands the security model at a granular level — choosing the right mechanism for the right purpose.

### Pattern: Architectural Urgency Recognition
D017 (i18n before content) is a rare case of the team recognising architectural debt *before* it accumulates. Usually i18n is retrofitted. Here, the Conductor sequenced it correctly: foundation before content.
