# Milestone Record: First MVP User Site

**Version:** v0.2.15
**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Role:** Historian
**Milestone:** First working MVP -- end-to-end zero-knowledge encrypted file transfer deployed to AWS Lambda
**Confirmed by:** Dinis Cruz (project owner), via manual testing and LinkedIn post

---

## 1. Milestone Summary

On 12 February 2026, SGraph Send achieved its first major milestone: a working MVP user site with end-to-end zero-knowledge encrypted file transfer, deployed to AWS Lambda and accessible via Lambda Function URL.

Dinis Cruz confirmed the full transfer cycle:

1. File uploaded via drag-and-drop on the user site
2. File encrypted client-side using AES-256-GCM (Web Crypto API)
3. Encrypted ciphertext stored on the server (in-memory for MVP)
4. Download link copied and opened in a separate browser window
5. Decryption key entered by the receiver
6. File downloaded and decrypted successfully in the browser

The decryption key never left the sender's device. The server never saw plaintext. This validates the core architectural premise of the project.

Dinis posted about this milestone on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7427535451630276608/

## 3. Key Architectural Decisions

The following decisions shaped the MVP. Each is recorded with its rationale and the alternatives that were rejected.

### D-MVP-001: AES-256-GCM for Client-Side Encryption

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2026-02-08 |
| Made By | Dinis Cruz (project brief) |
| Decision | Use AES-256-GCM symmetric encryption via the Web Crypto API for all client-side file encryption |
| Why | AES-256-GCM is natively supported by the Web Crypto API (no external dependencies), provides authenticated encryption (integrity + confidentiality), has no file size limitations, and is faster than asymmetric alternatives for bulk data. The sender and receiver share a symmetric key, so public/private keypair semantics are unnecessary. |
| Alternatives Rejected | RSA (asymmetric -- unnecessary complexity, size limitations, slower for large files), AES-CBC (no built-in authentication tag -- vulnerable to padding oracle attacks), external libraries like CryptoJS (adds dependency, Web Crypto API is already available in all modern browsers) |
| Supersedes | None (original decision) |
| Spec Reference | Project brief Section 4.4: "Key generation: Client generates an AES-256-GCM symmetric key (via Web Crypto API). This key never leaves the browser." |

### D-MVP-002: Lambda Function URLs Instead of API Gateway

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2026-02-08 |
| Made By | Dinis Cruz (Conductor review of project brief) |
| Decision | Use Lambda Function URLs for direct HTTPS endpoints instead of API Gateway |
| Why | API Gateway adds cost and complexity with no benefit for the MVP use case. Lambda Function URLs provide direct HTTPS endpoints with zero additional infrastructure. This simplifies deployment, reduces costs, and eliminates an entire service from the architecture. For an invitation-only beta with low traffic, API Gateway features (rate limiting, custom domains, caching) are not needed. |
| Alternatives Rejected | API Gateway (original spec -- adds cost, complexity, another service to manage), ALB (requires VPC, even more infrastructure), CloudFront + API Gateway (deferred -- CloudFront may be added later for custom domains and CDN) |
| Supersedes | Original project brief which specified "API Gateway + Lambda" |
| Spec Reference | Original brief Section 4.1 specified API Gateway. Changed during initial Conductor review. |

### D-MVP-003: In-Memory Storage for MVP

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2026-02-11 |
| Made By | Dev team (implementation decision), accepted by Dinis Cruz |
| Decision | Use in-memory storage (Memory-FS with memory backend) for the MVP instead of S3 |
| Why | Enables the fastest possible path to a working prototype. The Memory-FS abstraction layer means application code is identical regardless of backend -- switching to S3 later requires zero application code changes, only a configuration change. This allows testing the full transfer flow without any AWS storage infrastructure. |
| Alternatives Rejected | Direct S3 integration from day one (would have slowed MVP delivery, requires bucket setup, IAM roles, pre-signed URL configuration), local disk storage (not Lambda-compatible), DynamoDB (unnecessary complexity for MVP) |
| Supersedes | Original project brief which assumed S3 from the start |
| Known Limitation | Files only persist within a single Lambda invocation. If a different Lambda container handles the download request, the file is not found. Dinis confirmed this is acceptable for MVP validation -- "I was able to get it working once, and have the screenshots to prove it, which proves the full end to end flow." S3 backend is planned as the immediate next step via Memory-FS storage abstraction. |

### D-MVP-004: Two-Lambda Architecture

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2026-02-08 |
| Made By | Dinis Cruz (Conductor review of project brief) |
| Decision | Deploy two separate Lambda functions: one for public/user endpoints (transfers, health, static UI) and one for admin endpoints (tokens, stats) |
| Why | Security isolation -- the admin Lambda can have a separate auth model and more restrictive access. The user Lambda is anonymous/public (download links are public because content is encrypted). Separating them means a compromise of the public function does not expose admin capabilities. Each function can also scale independently and have different IAM roles. |
| Alternatives Rejected | Single Lambda (original brief implied one function -- simpler but mixes public and admin concerns), three+ Lambdas (over-engineering for MVP) |
| Supersedes | Original brief Section 8.1 which implied a single Lambda: "Lambda: secure-send-{tier}-api" |

### D-MVP-005: IFD Methodology for Frontend

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2026-02-08 |
| Made By | Dinis Cruz (Conductor) |
| Decision | Use IFD (Isolated Frontend Development) methodology: Web Components, zero framework dependencies, vanilla JS, surgical versioning with versioned paths (v0/v0.1/v0.1.0/index.html) |
| Why | Zero build step. Zero framework dependencies. Each UI version is a self-contained folder that can be deployed independently. No webpack, no npm, no transpilation. The UI loads instantly because there is nothing to bundle. Web Components provide encapsulation without framework lock-in. Versioned paths enable A/B testing and instant rollback by simply changing which path is served. |
| Alternatives Rejected | React (heavy build tooling, framework lock-in, npm dependency tree), Vue/Svelte (lighter but still require build step), Alpine.js (closer to vanilla but still a dependency) |
| Supersedes | Original brief Section 4.1 which mentioned "S3: Frontend Static Assets (HTML/JS/CSS)" without specifying methodology |
| Spec Reference | IFD guidance integrated from Issues-FS project (`library/guides/`) |

### D-MVP-006: Type_Safe Over Pydantic

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2026-02-08 |
| Made By | Dinis Cruz (project-wide rule) |
| Decision | All schemas and data classes use `Type_Safe` from `osbot-utils` instead of Pydantic |
| Why | Type_Safe provides runtime type safety with a lighter footprint than Pydantic. It integrates natively with the osbot ecosystem (osbot-utils, osbot-aws, osbot-fast-api). It avoids the Pydantic v1/v2 migration issues. The team controls the Type_Safe library and can extend it as needed. Known compatibility bug: some Type_Safe classes raise Pydantic errors when used as FastAPI route return values; the workaround is to call `.json()` and return a dict in those cases. |
| Alternatives Rejected | Pydantic (FastAPI's default -- banned from the project due to ecosystem alignment and control), dataclasses (less feature-rich than Type_Safe), attrs (external dependency not in osbot ecosystem) |
| Supersedes | The original Architect plan (v0.1.1) referenced Pydantic models in the service plan. This was corrected early. |

### D-MVP-007: Agentic Parallel Development

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2026-02-08 |
| Made By | Dinis Cruz (project brief Section 5) |
| Decision | Use a multi-agent AI team (10 roles) to develop the project, with backend and frontend built simultaneously by separate AI agents, coordinated by a Conductor role |
| Why | Parallel development by specialised agents enables faster delivery. Each role has domain expertise: Architect for API contracts, Dev for implementation, QA for testing, AppSec for security, DevOps for infrastructure. The Conductor orchestrates without bottlenecking. All agents share the same repo, same Issues FS, same review structure. This approach delivered a working MVP in 5 days from project start. |
| Alternatives Rejected | Single-developer sequential approach (slower), traditional team with human developers (not available for this project's timeline), single AI agent doing everything (loses specialisation benefits) |
| Key Observation | Backend (transfer API, service layer, schemas) and frontend (Web Components, encryption, drag-and-drop) were built in the same commit (`6df0af8` on 2026-02-11), demonstrating the parallel development approach. Dinis Cruz handled deployment infrastructure in parallel, committing Lambda support (`6802775`) the same day. |

### D-MVP-008: Test-Driven Deployment

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Date | 2026-02-11 |
| Made By | Dinis Cruz (DevOps brief v0.2.4) |
| Decision | Lambda deployment runs as pytest files. No mocks, no patches -- real in-memory stack starts in ~100ms. LocalStack is the only acceptable fake (for S3 integration tests). |
| Why | If deployment can be expressed as tests, it can be validated automatically on every push. The CI pipeline runs tests first; if they pass, deployment proceeds. This creates a single pipeline: push -> test -> deploy. The DevOps brief explicitly mandated: "Programmatic creation, programmatic verification, programmatic destruction. Everything from scratch, everything tested." |
| Alternatives Rejected | Manual deployment scripts (not testable), Terraform/CDK (introduces infrastructure-as-code tooling outside the Python ecosystem), deployment without testing gate (risky) |

## 4. Spec Changes from Original Brief

The following table tracks how the implemented MVP deviates from the original project brief (`library/docs/_to_process/project - Secure Send Service brief.md`).

| # | Original Spec | What Changed | Changed By | When | Why |
|---|---------------|-------------|------------|------|-----|
| SC-1 | Single Lambda function ("Lambda: secure-send-{tier}-api") | Two Lambda functions (admin + user) | Conductor | 2026-02-08 | Security isolation between admin and public endpoints |
| SC-2 | API Gateway as the HTTP layer | Lambda Function URLs (no API Gateway) | Conductor | 2026-02-08 | Simpler, cheaper, sufficient for MVP |
| SC-3 | S3 as primary storage from day one | In-memory storage (Memory-FS) for MVP; S3 planned via backend swap | Dev/Conductor | 2026-02-11 | Fastest path to working prototype; Memory-FS abstraction makes swap trivial |
| SC-4 | CloudFront in front of S3 + API Gateway | No CloudFront for MVP; Lambda Function URLs serve directly | Conductor | 2026-02-08 | Deferred -- not needed for invitation-only beta |
| SC-5 | Pre-signed URLs for all file transfer | Files proxied through Lambda (in-memory storage) | Dev | 2026-02-11 | Consequence of in-memory storage -- pre-signed URLs require S3. Will return when S3 backend is added |
| SC-6 | Pydantic models (implied by FastAPI default) | Type_Safe from osbot-utils (project-wide ban on Pydantic) | Conductor | 2026-02-08 | Ecosystem alignment, library control |
| SC-7 | M-Graph framework referenced | osbot-fast-api / osbot-fast-api-serverless used instead | Conductor | 2026-02-08 | M-Graph was a conceptual name; osbot-fast-api is the actual implementation |
| SC-8 | Register Interest feature in scope | Removed -- moved to external platform | Conductor | 2026-02-08 | Not core to MVP; handled by external service |
| SC-9 | 7 API endpoints specified | Subset implemented for MVP (transfer CRUD, health, static pages) | Dev | 2026-02-11 | Token management and admin stats deferred to admin Lambda development |
| SC-10 | Three environments (dev, qa, prod) | Single environment (dev) deployed for MVP validation | Conductor/DevOps | 2026-02-12 | qa and prod will follow once dev is stable |

---

## 5. Decision Patterns Observed

### Pattern 1: Pragmatic Scope Reduction
The project brief was ambitious (11 API endpoints, 3 environments, CloudFront, pre-signed URLs). The MVP stripped this to the minimum viable path: in-memory storage, Lambda Function URLs, single environment, file proxy through Lambda. Every reduction was made with a clear path back to the full specification -- the Memory-FS abstraction layer is the key enabler for this, as it makes storage backend changes transparent to application code.

### Pattern 2: Infrastructure-First Then Feature-Parallel
Dinis Cruz personally handled infrastructure (CI pipeline, Lambda deployment, GitHub Actions) while AI agents built features (transfer API, encryption, UI). This created two independent workstreams that converged on 2026-02-12 when the agent-built code deployed successfully on the Dinis-built infrastructure.

### Pattern 3: Human-AI Division of Labour
The project demonstrates a clear division: Dinis Cruz handled decisions, infrastructure, deployment, and validation; AI agents handled specification, implementation, testing, and documentation. The AI agents produced ~91 commits of code and documentation. Dinis Cruz made the critical architectural decisions, debugged deployment, confirmed the MVP worked, and communicated the milestone publicly.

### Pattern 4: Velocity Through Abstraction
The decision to use Memory-FS instead of direct S3, Type_Safe instead of Pydantic, and osbot-fast-api instead of raw FastAPI created a velocity advantage. Each abstraction reduced the number of things that needed to work simultaneously for the MVP to function. The trade-off was accepted: in-memory storage means files disappear when Lambda containers recycle, but it proved the end-to-end flow works.

### 6.2 CI Pipeline

The CI pipeline (`ci-pipeline__dev.yml` triggering `ci-pipeline.yml`) runs on every push to `dev`:

1. **Run Unit Tests** -- `pytest tests/unit/`
2. **Increment Tag** -- auto-increment minor version
3. **Check AWS Credentials** -- verify secrets are configured
4. **Deploy Admin Lambda** -- if credentials present
5. **Deploy User Lambda** -- if credentials present (runs in parallel with admin deploy)

The pipeline completed successfully for the MVP deployment. Both Lambda functions deployed automatically after tests passed.

## 7. Known Limitations at Milestone

These limitations were acknowledged at the time of the milestone and are not bugs -- they are deliberate MVP scope decisions.

| # | Limitation | Impact | Planned Resolution |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | In-memory storage -- files lost when Lambda container recycles | Download only works if same container handles both upload and download requests | Switch Memory-FS to S3 backend (code already exists in osbot ecosystem) |
| 2 | Web Crypto API error on localhost ("Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'generateKey')") | Encryption does not work when testing locally (HTTP); works on Lambda (HTTPS) | Web Crypto API requires Secure Context (HTTPS or localhost). Needs investigation for local development |
| 3 | No token authentication on MVP user site | Upload is open (no access token required) | Token auth middleware exists in admin Lambda; needs wiring into user Lambda |
| 4 | No transparency panel in MVP UI | Users do not see what metadata the server captured | UI component planned for next iteration |
| 5 | Single environment (dev) only | No qa or prod environments | Multi-environment deployment planned per DevOps brief |
| 6 | No file size limit enforcement | Server does not reject oversized files | To be added with S3 pre-signed URL switch |

---

## 8. What This Milestone Proves

1. **Zero-knowledge architecture works.** Files are encrypted in the browser, transferred as ciphertext, and decrypted in the receiver's browser. The server only ever handles encrypted blobs.

2. **The Memory-FS abstraction holds.** The application code was written against Memory-FS and worked identically on Lambda without any storage-specific code changes.

3. **Two-Lambda architecture deploys cleanly.** Both admin and user Lambda functions deploy independently via the same CI pipeline.

4. **Agentic development produces working software.** AI agents built the backend API, frontend UI, encryption logic, and test suite. A human (Dinis Cruz) handled infrastructure, deployment, and validation. The combination produced a working MVP in 5 days.

5. **The CI pipeline works end-to-end.** Push to dev triggers tests; passing tests trigger Lambda deployment. No manual deployment steps required after initial setup.

6. **Web Crypto API AES-256-GCM works for file transfer.** The encryption/decryption cycle produces byte-identical output. The key format (base64url) is practical for sharing via messaging apps.

---

## 9. What Comes Next

Per the MVP review (`v0.2.10__review-of-user-site-mvp.md`), the immediate priorities after this milestone are:

1. **S3 storage backend** -- switch Memory-FS from memory to S3 backend so files persist across Lambda invocations
2. **Security review** -- AppSec to audit the codebase for vulnerabilities (injection risk identified in `Routes__Transfers.info__transfer_id`)
3. **Type_Safe hardening** -- replace raw primitives and dicts with Type_Safe classes throughout the codebase
4. **Schema refactoring** -- one schema class per file, leveraging Type_Safe primitives
5. **Test improvement** -- add test helper classes, split route tests into direct and client variants
6. **Local development fix** -- investigate why Web Crypto API fails on localhost (Secure Context requirement)
7. **DevOps productization** -- per the v0.2.4 brief, make deployment repeatable, testable, and destroyable

---

## 10. Decision Log Continuation

This milestone record extends the decision log from `v0.2.1__response-to-infrastructure-brief.md`. The decisions above (D-MVP-001 through D-MVP-008) complement the existing D001--D013 series. The next decision captured should continue from D014.

### Open Questions Updated

| # | Question | Status | Resolution |
|---|----------|--------|-----------|
| Q001 | Max file size for Lambda proxy mode (6MB limit) | **Deferred** | MVP uses in-memory storage, no Lambda proxy limit hit. Will resurface when switching to S3 pre-signed URLs. |
| Q002 | When to switch from proxy mode to pre-signed URLs | **Deferred** | Same as Q001 -- the switch to S3 backend will introduce pre-signed URLs. |
| Q003 | Admin auth: single key or per-user (Phase 2) | Open | Not addressed in MVP. |
| Q004 | GCS native backend priority | Open | Not addressed in MVP. |
| Q005 | CLI encryption library choice (cryptography vs pycryptodome) | Open | Not addressed in MVP. |
| Q006 | Why does Web Crypto API fail on localhost? | **New** | Raised during MVP testing. Web Crypto requires Secure Context (HTTPS). Needs investigation for local development workflow. |
