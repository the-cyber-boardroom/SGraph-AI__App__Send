## Context

SGraph Send has achieved its first major milestone — a working MVP user site with end-to-end zero-knowledge encrypted file transfer deployed to AWS Lambda.

---

## Task

**Capture this major milestone in the project history.**

### Timeline to Document

| 2026-02-12 | Dinis shares MVP on LinkedIn | v0.2.10 |
| 2026-02-12 | MVP review with detailed next steps issued | v0.2.10 |

### Key Decisions to Record

1. **AES-256-GCM chosen** for client-side encryption (Web Crypto API native)
2. **Lambda Function URLs** instead of API Gateway (simpler, cheaper for MVP)
3. **In-memory storage** for MVP (acceptable — S3 backend planned via Memory-FS)
4. **Two-Lambda architecture** — separate admin (auth-required) and user (anonymous) functions
5. **IFD methodology** for frontend — Web Components, zero dependencies, versioned paths
6. **Test-driven deployment** — Lambda deployment runs as pytest files
7. **Type_Safe over Pydantic** — project-wide decision for runtime type safety
8. **Agentic parallel development** — backend and frontend built simultaneously by separate AI agents
