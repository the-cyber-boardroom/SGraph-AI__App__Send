# v0.1.2 — Work Items and Roadmap Updates

**version** v0.1.2  
**date** 9 Feb 2026  
**role** Dev

## 1. Immediate work items (implementation)

| Priority | Item | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | Build public/admin Fast_API split with route classes | Dev |
| P0 | Implement Memory-FS storage service in single-file mode | Dev |
| P0 | Implement transfer lifecycle routes with event/action/request logs | Dev |
| P0 | Implement frontend SPA shell using IFD + Web Components | Dev |
| P1 | Add themes/i18n/accessibility baseline in UI | Dev |
| P1 | Implement user tools pages (crypto lab, storage inspector, API explorer) | Dev |
| P1 | Integrate LocalStack S3 integration tests | Dev |

## 2. New required research item

### Register Interest externalisation

In-product register-interest endpoint/page is removed from MVP.

Research task to create:

- evaluate external providers for waitlist/interest capture
- criteria:
  - privacy model
  - API/webhook integration
  - exportability
  - cost
  - data residency options
- output:
  - short-list and recommended provider

## 3. Python client roadmap item

Create roadmap task for python API client abstraction (post-MVP):

1. encapsulate route changes from API consumers
2. provide stable consumer methods independent of URL patterns
3. support both public and admin endpoint sets

## 4. Documentation work items

1. Keep version-prefixed docs for each release iteration.
2. Keep backend plan, frontend plan, data model, and test plan in separate files.
3. Keep page-design artifacts per key page under frontend page-design folders.

## 5. Risk log updates

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Route/contract churn during migration from v0.1.1 assumptions | Introduce python client roadmap item early |
| Storage mode differences (presign vs api-bytes) | Return mode metadata and test both paths |
| Excess observability data volume | Keep per-transfer partitioning and retention policy backlog |
| i18n/themes/accessibility scope creep | Start with baseline implementation and expand iteratively |
