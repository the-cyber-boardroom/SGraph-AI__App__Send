## 2. Current Workload Assessment

### What was on the plate (from v0.3.2 action plan, 14 Feb)

| Item | Status | Disposition |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Handover prep (H-1 to H-7)** — document API contracts, error-path tests, known limitations, env vars, Storage_FS swap, service registry, v0.2.0 consolidated UI | In progress | **Carries forward.** Still needed but deprioritised behind P1 user-facing bugs. Handover is a Villager gate — Explorer Dev prepares content, Villager Dev packages. Not time-critical today. |
| **IFD v0.2.0 consolidation (IFD-1 to IFD-5)** — merge v0.1.x into clean v0.2.0 baseline, prototype overrides, lint guard, guide update | Pending | **Carries forward at lower priority.** The brief adds new IFD work (version manifest, #11) but the consolidation is still pending. Not blocked by anything — just lower priority than user-facing bugs. |
| **Issues FS flat file (IF-1)** | Pending | **Carries forward.** Small task, can be done during any session. |
| **Admin UI token detail view (A-1)** | Pending | **Subsumed.** The new brief's admin tasks (#4, #16, #18) supersede the previous A-1 priority. Token detail view remains useful but is not explicitly called out in the new brief. |
| **Token gate i18n bug (F015)** | Pending | **Carries forward.** Not mentioned in new brief, remains P2. |
| **Large file transfer proto (LF-1 to LF-4)** | Pending (Architect design) | **Superseded by #19** (upload/download resilience research). Same workstream, now scoped as a joint research doc with Architect rather than a prototype. |

### What's new (from v0.3.10 brief)

- **7 P1 tasks** — all new, none existed on yesterday's plate
- **11 P2 tasks** — all new except the large file transfer work (now reframed as #19)
- **2 P3 tasks** — new SA dashboard extensions

### Net assessment

The v0.3.2 action plan had ~15 tasks. The v0.3.10 brief adds 20 tasks. Some overlap (large file = resilience research), some carry forward (handover, IFD consolidation, i18n). **Effective backlog is ~25 items.** This is a heavy load.

The critical shift: yesterday's priorities were handover-focused (prepare for Villager). Today's priorities are user-experience-focused (fix what real users are hitting). This is the right call — the bugs affect every session.

---

## 3. Proposed Execution Order

Following the Conductor's three-track guidance: user-facing P1 bugs first, then admin P1, then SA gating item.

### Wave 1: User-Facing P1 Bugs (Independent, Ship Fast)

These five tasks are independent of each other and independent of any other role. They can be worked immediately and in any order. Recommended order is by impact and effort:

| Order | Task # | Description | Effort | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| 1.1 | **#6** | Prevent navigation during upload/download (`beforeunload` guard) | **S** | One-liner per the brief. Prevents data loss. Highest value-to-effort ratio in the entire brief. |
| 1.2 | **#2** | Fix token expiry message (show error instead of silent redirect) | **S** | Straightforward conditional check + error display. Users are currently confused by silent failure. |
| 1.3 | **#1** | Fix download page loading experience (show loading state) | **S** | Add loading indicator, defer mailing list. Requires understanding the page load sequence. |
| 1.4 | **#3** | Implement token-aware page state (detect existing token, adjust UI) | **M** | Check `localStorage` for token, conditionally show "Send a file" vs. "Join the programme". Slightly more logic than #1/#2 because it needs valid-token detection. |
| 1.5 | **#5** | Fix upload progress bar granularity (granular events per stage) | **L** | Requires instrumenting 8-10 stages of the upload pipeline with progress events. Touches crypto, upload, and UI layers. Most complex of the user-facing P1 bugs. |

**Estimated time for Wave 1:** Can ship #6, #2, #1, #3 in quick succession. #5 requires deeper investigation of the upload pipeline.

### Wave 2: Admin P1 Bug

| Order | Task # | Description | Effort | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| 2.1 | **#4** | Fix Analytics Pulse on admin Lambda | **M** | Investigate why the pulse endpoint is not returning data. Could be a backend route issue, a data flow issue, or a UI rendering issue. Need to diagnose before fixing. |

### Wave 3: SA Gating Item (Cache Browser)

This is the single most important SA task because it unblocks #12, #13, and #21. However, it has a dependency on Architect producing the path-based routing design (#17).

| Order | Task # | Description | Effort | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| 3.1 | **#17** | Set up path-based routing for SA dashboard | **M** | Foundation for all SA views. Depends on Architect design. Dev can start scaffolding the routing infrastructure while Architect finalises the design. |
| 3.2 | **#7** | Build cache service browser UI | **XL** | The most complex single deliverable. Browse cache IDs, temporal navigation, view latest, inspect entries, folder navigation. This is a full application view. |

### Wave 4: P2 Tasks (Dependency-Ordered)

| Order | Task # | Description | Effort | Blocked By |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------|------------|
| 4.1 | **#18** | Add admin UI navigation links (Swagger, main site, docs) | **S** | Nothing |
| 4.2 | **#16** | Add API call log, event log, message panel to admin UI | **M** | May need code from human |
| 4.3 | **#8** | Capture end-to-end send workflow timings | **M** | Nothing |
| 4.4 | **#19** | Research: upload/download resilience | **L** | Nothing (research) |
| 4.5 | **#14** | Show token usage counter in UI | **S** | Designer: UI spec |
| 4.6 | **#10** | Fix token fetch performance | **M** | Architect: cache mapping (#9) |
| 4.7 | **#11** | IFD version manifest + version switcher | **L** | Architect: manifest spec |
| 4.8 | **#15** | S3-triggered Lambda for LETS | **L** | DevOps: S3 event config |
| 4.9 | **#12** | Build Lambda functions dashboard | **L** | Cache browser (#7) |
| 4.10 | **#13** | Build CloudFront log viewer | **L** | Cache browser (#7) |

### Wave 5: P3 Tasks

| Order | Task # | Description | Effort | Blocked By |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------|------------|
| 5.1 | **#21** | Build AWS infrastructure overview | **L** | Cache browser (#7) |
| 5.2 | **#22** | Implement delta tracking | **M** | LETS pipeline (#15) |

### Carry-Forward Items (Not in Today's Brief)

| Item | Effort | When |
|------|--------|------|
| Handover documentation (H-1 to H-7) | L | Between waves, when natural breakpoints occur |
| IFD v0.2.0 consolidation (IFD-1 to IFD-5) | L | After Wave 1 ships and stabilises |
| Token gate i18n bug (F015) | S | Opportunistic — batch with next UI minor version |
| Issues FS flat file (IF-1) | S | Next session start |

---

## 4. Parallel Opportunities

Several tasks are independent and can run simultaneously. In a multi-session or multi-agent scenario, these groups can be parallelised:

### Parallel Group A: User-Facing P1 Bugs (All Independent)

Tasks #1, #2, #3, #5, #6 share no code dependencies with each other:

- **#6** (`beforeunload` guard) touches the upload and download page event handlers
- **#2** (token expiry message) touches the token validation/redirect logic
- **#1** (download loading state) touches the download page initial render
- **#3** (token-aware state) touches the download page post-render conditional display
- **#5** (upload progress) touches the upload pipeline event emitters

**Caution on #1 + #3:** These both modify the download page layout/state. If worked in parallel by different agents, there is a merge risk. Recommend sequencing #1 before #3 (loading state first, then token-aware conditionals on top).

### Parallel Group B: Independent P2 Tasks

These P2 tasks have no dependency on each other or on Waves 1-3:

- **#8** (end-to-end timing capture) — standalone instrumentation
- **#18** (admin UI navigation links) — standalone UI change
- **#19** (resilience research) — document production, no code

### Parallel Group C: Architect-Blocked Tasks

These cannot start until the Architect delivers, but once unblocked, they are independent of each other:

- **#10** (token fetch performance) — unblocked by Architect cache mapping
- **#11** (IFD version manifest) — unblocked by Architect manifest spec
- **#7/#17** (cache browser + routing) — unblocked by Architect routing design

---

## 5. Blockers

| Blocker | Blocking Role | What Dev Is Waiting For | Dev Tasks Blocked |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Architect: path-based routing design** | Architect | Design spec for how SA dashboard routing works (URL structure, component mapping, integration with admin shell) | #7 (cache browser), #17 (routing setup), #12 (Lambda dashboard), #13 (CloudFront viewer), #21 (infrastructure overview) |
| **Architect: cache service usage mapping** | Architect | Architecture mapping of how token storage/retrieval currently uses the cache service, identifying the bottleneck | #10 (token fetch performance) |
| **Architect: IFD version manifest spec** | Architect | Specification of the manifest file format, location, update mechanism | #11 (IFD version manifest + switcher) |
| **Designer: token usage UI spec** | Designer | Visual design for the token usage counter and token confirmation display | #14 (token usage counter) |
| **DevOps: S3 event trigger configuration** | DevOps | S3 event notification setup, IAM permissions, trigger patterns for LETS Lambda | #15 (S3-triggered Lambda) |
| **Human: missing UI element code** | Human (Dinis) | Code for API call log, event log, message panel — may exist in other projects | #16 (three missing UI elements) |

**Impact assessment:** The Architect is the single biggest bottleneck. Three separate Architect deliverables block 8 of Dev's 20 tasks. The Conductor should ensure the Architect prioritises the cache mapping (#9) and routing design (#17) above all else — these are the two deliverables that unblock the most downstream work.

The Designer and DevOps blockers each affect one task and are not on the critical path for today. They can be resolved async.

The human blocker on #16 is a soft dependency — Dev can build the components from scratch, but the brief says existing implementations exist. Dev should request the code early so it is available when Wave 4 starts.

## 6. Estimated Complexity

| Task # | Description | Size | Rationale |
|--------|-------------|------|-----------|
| **#1** | Download page loading experience | **S** | Add loading indicator element, reorder CSS/JS load priority. Mostly HTML/CSS. |
| **#2** | Token expiry message | **S** | Add conditional error message on redirect. Check token state, display appropriate message. One component, one code path. |
| **#3** | Token-aware page state | **M** | Read `localStorage`, validate token, conditionally render. Needs token validation logic (not just presence check — token could be expired). |
| **#4** | Analytics Pulse fix | **M** | Diagnosis required. Could be backend (route not returning data), data pipeline (no data flowing), or frontend (component not rendering). Unknown root cause adds effort. |
| **#5** | Upload progress granularity | **L** | Instrument 8-10 stages of the upload pipeline. Touches crypto layer (encryption progress callback), upload layer (XHR/fetch progress events), and UI layer (progress bar component). Needs careful event design. |
| **#6** | Navigation guard (`beforeunload`) | **S** | Literally a `window.addEventListener('beforeunload', ...)` during active transfers. Phase 2 (on-page link interception) is M. |
| **#7** | Cache service browser UI | **XL** | Full application view. Cache ID browsing, temporal navigation, latest view, JSON/text/binary inspection, folder structure navigation. Multiple sub-components. This is the largest single task. |
| **#8** | End-to-end timing capture | **M** | Add `performance.mark()` / `performance.measure()` at each stage. Server-side timing via Lambda context. Store results in cache service. Well-defined scope. |
| **#10** | Token fetch performance | **M** | Fix depends on Architect's diagnosis. Implementation likely involves cache lookup optimisation — changing the data access pattern, not the algorithm. Could be S if it is a simple fix, L if architectural change needed. |
| **#11** | IFD version manifest + switcher | **L** | New manifest file format, manifest generation process, admin UI version switcher component, version comparison display. Touches both backend (manifest endpoint) and frontend (switcher UI). |
| **#12** | Lambda functions dashboard | **L** | New SA view. List Lambda functions, display config/metrics, historical comparison. Needs data from cache service (collected data pipeline). Multiple sub-components. |
| **#13** | CloudFront log viewer | **L** | New SA view. Traffic patterns, request rates, response codes, popular endpoints. Needs processed log data from LETS pipeline. Visualisation component needed. |
| **#14** | Token usage counter | **S** | Straightforward UI addition once Designer provides the spec. Data already exists in cache service — just surface it. |
| **#15** | S3-triggered Lambda for LETS | **L** | New Lambda function. S3 event handler, log parsing, normalisation, compression, cache service write. Needs DevOps to configure the trigger. Multiple data formats to handle. |
| **#16** | API call log, event log, message panel | **M** | Three UI components. If code is provided by human, effort drops to S (integration only). If building from scratch, M. |
| **#17** | Path-based routing for SA dashboard | **M** | Client-side router for path-based navigation. Integration with admin shell. Route registration, component lazy loading, URL state management. |
| **#18** | Admin UI navigation links | **S** | Add links to admin shell navigation. HTML + minimal styling. Trivial. |
| **#19** | Upload/download resilience research | **L** | Research document. Browser API survey, S3 multipart capabilities, encryption interaction analysis, open-source landscape review, proposed architecture. Joint with Architect. |
| **#21** | AWS infrastructure overview | **L** | New SA view. Consolidated view of CloudFront, Route 53, S3, Lambda configurations. Multiple data sources, single-page layout. |
| **#22** | Delta tracking for collected data | **M** | JSON diff comparison between temporal snapshots. Store diffs, skip saves when no change. Well-defined algorithm, moderate integration. |

### Size Distribution

| Size | Count | Tasks |
|------|-------|-------|
| **S** | 5 | #1, #2, #6, #14, #18 |
| **M** | 6 | #3, #4, #8, #10, #16, #17, #22 |
| **L** | 7 | #5, #11, #12, #13, #15, #19, #21 |
| **XL** | 1 | #7 |

**Total estimated effort:** 5S + 6M + 7L + 1XL. This is a significant workload. Even with aggressive parallelisation, not all of this ships in one day.

## 7. Recommendations

### 7.1 Workload Is Heavy — Ruthless Prioritisation Required

20 tasks is too many for a single Dev stream in one cycle. The Conductor's three-track guidance is correct: focus on the P1 user-facing bugs, then the SA gating item. Everything else is secondary.

**Realistic scope for today's sessions:**
- Wave 1 complete (5 user-facing P1 bugs) — achievable
- Wave 2 complete (#4 Analytics Pulse) — achievable if diagnosis is straightforward
- Wave 3 started (#17 routing + #7 cache browser scaffolding) — achievable if Architect delivers routing design early
- Wave 4 cherry-picks (#18 admin links, #8 timing capture) — opportunistic

### 7.2 Unblock the Architect

The Architect is the single biggest constraint on Dev throughput. Three separate Architect deliverables block 8 tasks. Dev should communicate to the Conductor:

1. **Cache service usage mapping (#9)** is needed immediately — it blocks token fetch performance (#10)
2. **Path-based routing design (#17)** is needed before cache browser (#7) can start — it blocks the entire SA dashboard track
3. **IFD manifest spec (#11)** can wait until after routing design is delivered

Recommended Architect priority: **#9 first** (small, unblocks Dev quickly), then **#17** (larger, unblocks the SA critical path).

### 7.3 Request Human Code for #16 Early

The brief says API call log, event log, and message panel exist in the human's other projects. Dev should request this code immediately rather than waiting until Wave 4. If the code arrives early, #16 drops from M to S and can be batched with #18 (admin links).

### 7.4 #5 (Upload Progress) Is Deeper Than It Looks

The brief lists 10 stages that need progress events. This requires understanding the current upload pipeline end-to-end, adding event emission points in the crypto layer, upload layer, and UI layer, and building a progress state machine. This is the hardest P1 task and may need to be split into sub-tasks:

- **#5a**: Add basic stage indicators (encryption starting, upload starting, done) — **S**, immediate value
- **#5b**: Add percentage-based progress within encryption and upload stages — **M**, requires `ProgressEvent` from XHR or `ReadableStream` progress from Fetch API, plus Web Crypto progress (which has no built-in progress callback — may need chunked encryption approach)

Recommend shipping #5a first, #5b in a follow-up.

### 7.5 #7 (Cache Browser) Should Be Incrementally Delivered

The cache browser is XL because it encompasses browsing, temporal navigation, inspection, and folder navigation. Recommend splitting:

- **#7a**: Cache ID listing with latest view — **M**, immediate value, proves the routing works
- **#7b**: Temporal navigation (date-based browsing) — **M**, adds history capability
- **#7c**: Entry inspection (JSON viewer, folder structure) — **M**, completes the tool

Each increment is usable and testable on its own.

### 7.6 Carry-Forward Items Are Deprioritised, Not Forgotten

The handover documentation (H-1 to H-7) and IFD v0.2.0 consolidation from the v0.3.2 action plan are still needed but are not in today's brief. They should be tracked in the Dev `.issues` file and picked up during natural breaks between waves.

### 7.7 Sequencing Concern: #7 and #17 Are Entangled

Tasks #7 (cache browser) and #17 (path-based routing) are listed separately in the brief but are functionally one workstream. The cache browser cannot exist without the routing, and the routing has no value without at least one view to route to. Recommend treating #7 + #17 as a single work item for planning purposes.

### 7.8 P3 Items (#21, #22) Will Not Be Reached Today

Both P3 items depend on Wave 3 (#7) and Wave 4 (#15) respectively. Given the volume of P1 and P2 work, these are realistically next-cycle items. Acknowledging them here but not planning for them in today's execution.

## 8. Execution Summary

| Wave | Tasks | Dependencies | Status |
|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Wave 1** | #6, #2, #1, #3, #5 | None | Ready to start |
| **Wave 2** | #4 | None | Ready to start (can parallel with Wave 1) |
| **Wave 3** | #17, #7 | Architect: routing design | Blocked |
| **Wave 4** | #18, #16, #8, #19, #14, #10, #11, #15, #12, #13 | Various (see Section 5) | Partially blocked |
| **Wave 5** | #21, #22 | Waves 3-4 | Not this cycle |
| **Carry-forward** | H-1 to H-7, IFD-1 to IFD-5, F015, IF-1 | None | Deprioritised |

**First action:** Start Wave 1 — implement `beforeunload` guard (#6), then token expiry message (#2), then download page loading fix (#1).

---

*Dev action plan complete. 20 tasks acknowledged, sequenced, sized, and dependency-mapped. Awaiting Architect deliverables to unblock Waves 3-4. Proceeding with user-facing P1 bugs immediately.*
