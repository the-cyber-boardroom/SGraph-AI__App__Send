# v0.1.2 — Dev Review Pack (Master Index)

**version** v0.1.2  
**date** 9 Feb 2026  
**author** Dev role (Codex)  
**status** ready for conductor review

## Goal of this pack

Recreate and split the previous dev plan into multiple review documents, aligned with the conductor guidance in:

- `team/humans/dinis_cruz/briefs/2026-02-08/v0.1.0__review-on-dev-and-librarian-commits.md`

This pack supersedes:

- `team/roles/dev/briefs/v0.1.1__sgraph-send-plan-mode-to-review.md` (kept for history)

## Key alignment points captured

1. Use `Memory-FS` as storage abstraction; default single-file mode.
2. Use `OSBot-Fast-API-Serverless` patterns and route classes.
3. Use `Type_Safe` schemas and primitives (no Pydantic in service contracts).
4. Use `osbot-aws` wrappers for AWS interactions (no direct `boto3` usage).
5. Use two lambda functions:
   - public endpoints
   - admin endpoints (protected by built-in Fast_API auth)
6. Use event-per-file in `events/` folder (no single mutable `events.json` write hotspot).
7. Enforce max file size 100MB for MVP.
8. Remove in-app register-interest implementation from MVP and track external provider research instead.
9. Prefix all newly-created markdown files with current repo version.
