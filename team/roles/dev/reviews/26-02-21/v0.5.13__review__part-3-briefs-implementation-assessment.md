## Implementation Notes

### Secrets Manager (Smallest, Highest ROI)

Uses **existing** SG/Send API — no new routes. Build:
1. Admin UI page (`/admin/secrets.html`) for creating/editing secrets documents
2. Python client library (`sgsend_secrets.py`) for Lambda/CI/CD consumption
3. Browser-side encryption on save (same pattern as file upload)

**Effort: 1-2 sessions.** Immediately reduces deployment pain from 20 env vars to 2.

### Admin Agent Chat

New page with:
- Agent selector (19 roles)
- Provider selector (5 LLM providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama, Chrome AI)
- Context loading from GitHub Pages
- Multi-turn conversation with token counting
- Browser Pod integration for API key protection

**Key implementation detail**: the unified `chatCompletion()` interface abstracts all 5 providers. Anthropic uses a different API format from OpenAI-compatible providers. Ollama and Chrome AI have no API keys.

### FastAPI EC2 Routes

Thin wrappers around `osbot_aws.ec2`. The brief provides example code. Key concerns:
- Budget controls must be enforced **before** every create operation
- All operations logged to audit trail
- Routes in separate FastAPI router (extractable to dedicated Lambda later)
- SSH via paramiko in Lambda (pure Python, no native dependencies)

### Data Room UX + Fleet Management

**Largest effort.** Two separate deliverables:
1. **Fleet Management** (admin page) — CRUD for data rooms, status monitoring, sync triggers
2. **Data Room UX** (user-facing) — entry flow, file browser, directory, messaging, file visualizers

File visualizers need: PDF.js, marked.js (markdown), image blob URLs. All in sandboxed iframes.

### Browser Pod (Phase 1)

SW with in-memory secrets (no IndexedDB persistence). Enough for agent chat MVP:
- `pod__install()`, `pod__store_key()`, `pod__status()`, `pod__budget()`
- Network interception for Anthropic/OpenAI/OpenRouter
- `sg-send.js` client library with all agent helpers

### Performance Investigation

**BLOCKED.** The brief explicitly says do not start until human provides guidance on `osbot-utils` performance testing utilities. The test file `tests/qa/local-server/test__bug__local_server_performance.py` was included.

## Recommended Build Sequence

```
Session 1: Secrets Manager (small, high ROI, unblocks EC2 routes)
Session 2: Agent Context Pages + Browser Pod Phase 1
Session 3: Admin Agent Chat
Session 4: FastAPI EC2 Routes
Session 5-7: Data Room UX + Fleet Management
Session 8: Team Site
(Parallel): SSH Key Utility (any developer with spare capacity)
(When unblocked): Performance Investigation
```
