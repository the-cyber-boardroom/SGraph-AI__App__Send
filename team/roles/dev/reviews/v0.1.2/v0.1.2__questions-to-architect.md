# v0.1.2 — Questions to Architect

**version** v0.1.2  
**date** 9 Feb 2026

## Questions

1. Please confirm the canonical public/admin route naming set so method names can be locked before code generation.
2. For storage abstraction, do you want API payload upload/download endpoints always available, or only when presign is unsupported?
3. Should transfer `status` remain minimal in MVP (`pending`, `completed`, `expired`, `deleted`) or include additional operational states?
4. For the transfer folder structure, should `observability/` be separate from `events/actions/requests`, or consolidated?
5. Do you want user-tools routes and admin routes represented in the same system landscape map revision, or split by site?
