# v0.1.2 — Dev Review of Conductor Feedback

**version** v0.1.2  
**date** 9 Feb 2026  
**source** `roles/conductor/reviews/v0.1.0__review-on-dev-and-librarian-commits.md`

## Summary

This document captures the implementation-impacting deltas from v0.1.1 plans to the v0.1.2 direction.

## Decision delta matrix

| Topic | v0.1.1 assumption | v0.1.2 direction |
|------|--------------------|------------------|
| File naming | Mixed naming across docs | All new markdown files prefixed with repo version |
| Backend data sensitivity | Metadata treated as operational data | Backend data must be non-sensitive/non-confidential; add anonymisation mode |
| Storage architecture | S3-centric plan | Memory-FS abstraction first; S3 is one backend |
| S3 testing | mocked S3 for most tests | LocalStack for S3 integration tests; memory-backed no-mock tests as default |
| AWS SDK usage | direct boto3 in examples | `osbot-aws` classes only |
| API hosting | single service model | split into two lambda functions (public + admin) |
| API pathing | `/api/v1` base used in previous drafts | no base path versioning; rely on python client abstraction later |
| Route model | FastAPI-style endpoint grouping | OSBot-Fast-API route classes and naming patterns |
| Schema model | Pydantic examples | Type_Safe schemas, one schema per file, `Schema__App__Send__*` |
| Service classes | generic service names | `Service__App__Send__*` naming pattern |
| Event storage | `events.json` append model | `events/` folder, one event per file |
| Timestamp type | ISO strings in most examples | int timestamps using `Timestamp_Now` primitive |
| IDs | string IDs | Obj_Id-based types; `Transfer_Id` with empty support + `.new()` |
| Register interest | in-product endpoint + page | moved out of app; add provider research task |
| Max file size | mixed references including >100MB | set MVP max at 100MB |
| Frontend architecture | static pages + route options | IFD methodology + SPA client routes + no hash routing |
| UI topology | single app with admin page | separate user and admin sites; plus user tools site |
| Extensibility | themes/i18n/accessibility phased later | support themes/i18n/accessibility from start |

## Mandatory standards for v0.1.2 docs and plans

1. Follow guidance in:
   - `library/dependencies/osbot-fast-api/v0.24.2__osbot-fast-api__routes_development_guide.md`
   - `library/dependencies/osbot-utils/type_safe/v3.63.4__for_llms__type_safe.md`
   - `library/dependencies/memory-fs/v0.36.2__memory-fs__architecture-and-how-to-use-It.md`
   - `library/dependencies/osbot-aws/v2.29.9__osbot-aws__s3.md`
   - `library/guides/development/ifd/v1.2.1__ifd__intro-and-how-to-use.md`
2. Keep storage and observability file-oriented and explicit.
3. Split design docs by concern (backend, frontend, data model, testing/security, tasks/questions).

## Impact on implementation sequencing

1. Build storage abstraction and route-class skeleton first.
2. Build public/admin service split before implementing endpoint logic.
3. Implement transfer lifecycle with event-per-file + action/request log trails.
4. Build UI as SPA Web Components using IFD flow with minimal startup path.
5. Add power tools and admin capabilities on top of validated core flow.
