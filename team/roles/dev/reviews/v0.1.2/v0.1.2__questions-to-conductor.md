## Questions

1. For anonymisation mode, should raw IP ever be persisted for admin-only diagnostics, or should it be fully disabled in all modes?
2. Should public transfer status responses expose any receiver metadata beyond aggregate counts and timestamps?
3. For the two-site model, do you want separate domains now (`admin-send.sgraph.ai`) or a path split initially?
