## The Metaphor

The team produces technical substance. The Alchemist transforms it into investment gold. Real alchemists weren't charlatans -- they were the first systematic experimenters who had to convince wealthy patrons to fund their laboratories. That's literally this role.

## Key Distinction

```
Ambassador:  represents the project to THE WORLD (broad, soft power)
Alchemist:   represents the project to INVESTORS (narrow, high stakes)
```

## Key Collaborators

- **Ambassador** -- hands off investor leads; Alchemist owns the relationship from there
- **Architect** -- provides technical grounding for all investor claims
- **Conductor** -- receives business priorities from Alchemist; decides what gets built
- **Dev** -- coordinates on demo readiness for investor meetings
- **DevOps** -- provides real deployment cost data for financial models
- **Sherpa** -- provides user traction stories (investor fuel)
- **AppSec** -- provides security review findings (credibility)
- **GRC** -- manages the B0-B10 business priority framework
- **Journalist** -- may produce content that doubles as investor material
