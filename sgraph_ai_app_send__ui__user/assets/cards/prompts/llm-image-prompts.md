Use these prompts with ChatGPT/DALL-E, Midjourney, or similar image generation tools to create polished visual mockups of the card designs.

---

## Design A: The Minimal

### Front

```
Create a photorealistic mockup of a business card, 85mm x 55mm, white card stock with a matte finish. The card has a clean, minimal design with black text on white background. At the top-left, the brand name "SG/Send" in a bold sans-serif font (Helvetica or similar), approximately 22pt, with the forward slash in teal (#0d9488). Below it, three lines of text in a lighter weight: "Zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing." (bold), "Your files are encrypted in your browser.", "The server can never read them." At the bottom-left, the URL "send.sgraph.ai" in teal, 10pt, bold. Generous whitespace. No decorative elements. The aesthetic is Swiss/International typographic style -- clean, confident, information-dense but not cluttered. Show the card at a slight angle on a neutral grey surface with soft shadow.
```

### Back

```
Create a photorealistic mockup of the back of a business card, 85mm x 55mm, white matte card stock. Top section has "HOW TO USE" in small grey uppercase letters (6pt, letter-spaced). Below it, four numbered steps in small sans-serif text: "1. Go to send.sgraph.ai", "2. Enter your access code (below)", "3. Drop a file -- it encrypts in your browser", "4. Share the link + key via separate channels". Below the steps, "YOUR ACCESS CODE" label in small grey uppercase, followed by a clean black underline (the full width of the card minus margins) where someone would handwrite a code. Bottom-left corner has a subtle brand mark "SG/" in light grey with the slash in teal -- a small typographic icon, not a logo image. Bottom-right has "No app. No account. Just a browser." in small grey text. Clean sans-serif typography throughout. Show the card flat on a white surface.
```

## Design B: The Slash

### Front

```
Create a photorealistic mockup of a business card, 85mm x 55mm, with a dark navy background (#0f172a). The card features the brand name "SG/Send" centred, in white, bold sans-serif, approximately 28pt. The forward slash "/" is in teal (#0d9488), same weight and size as the surrounding text -- just the colour changes. Two subtle diagonal lines run from upper-left to lower-right across the entire card in teal with low opacity (one at 40% opacity, one at 20%), creating a dynamic slash motif behind the text. Below the brand name, "ZERO-KNOWLEDGE ENCRYPTED SHARING" in small uppercase letters, letter-spaced, in muted slate blue (#94a3b8). The overall aesthetic is premium, dark, modern -- like a fintech or cybersecurity company card. Show the card at a slight angle on a dark surface with dramatic lighting.
```

### Back

```
Create a photorealistic mockup of the back of a business card, 85mm x 55mm, white background. Top-left has "send.sgraph.ai" in dark navy bold text. Top-right has a subtle brand mark "SG/" in light grey with the slash in teal (#0d9488) -- a small typographic icon. Middle section has "YOUR ACCESS CODE" label in small grey uppercase, with a rounded-corner rectangle outline below it (the full card width minus margins, 8mm tall) where someone would write a code. The box has a navy border. Below, "The server can't read your files." in bold dark text, and "No app needed. No account needed." in muted grey. At the very bottom of the card, a thin horizontal accent bar in teal (#0d9488), 1.5mm tall, spanning the full width. Clean, modern sans-serif typography. Show the card on a light surface.
```

## Design C: The Quote

### Front

```
Create a photorealistic mockup of a business card, 85mm x 55mm, white card stock. The design leads with a large opening quotation mark in teal (#0d9488), approximately 36pt, at the top-left. Below it, a quote in italic sans-serif text: "I can't tell you how many times I've needed something like this. If you use Signal, Proton, or whatever else, the other party needs the same tech." The quote is in dark charcoal (#1e293b), approximately 8.5pt, with good line spacing. Below the quote, an attribution in small grey text: "-- Beta user, security professional". At the bottom of the card, the brand "SG/Send" in bold sans-serif (14pt) on the left, with "send.sgraph.ai" in teal on the right. The overall feel is editorial, like a testimonial page from a high-end brand. Show the card at a slight angle on a warm grey surface.
```

### Back

```
Create a photorealistic mockup of the back of a business card, 85mm x 55mm, very light warm grey background (#fafafa). At the top, "ZERO-KNOWLEDGE ENCRYPTED FILE SHARING" in small bold uppercase dark text. Below, a paragraph in grey text: "Your files are encrypted in your browser before they leave your device. The server stores only encrypted bytes it cannot read." Then "No app. No sign-up. Just a browser." in bold dark text. Below, "YOUR ACCESS CODE" label in small grey uppercase, with a clean underline for handwriting. Bottom-right corner has a subtle brand mark "SG/" in light grey with the slash in teal -- a small typographic icon. Clean, informative, functional. Show on a light surface.
```

## Design D: Brand Icon

### Front

```
Create a photorealistic mockup of a business card, 85mm x 55mm, white card stock, centred layout. The brand "SG/Send" is centred, bold sans-serif, 24pt, dark navy (#0f172a), with the slash in teal (#0d9488). Below it, "Zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing" in small grey text, centred. Below that, "send.sgraph.ai" in teal, bold, centred. The design is perfectly symmetrical and balanced with generous whitespace above and below. Ultra-minimal, premium feel. Show the card on a clean white surface with soft shadow.
```

### Back

```
Create a photorealistic mockup of the back of a business card, 85mm x 55mm, white. The left side features a LARGE typographic brand mark "SG/" in light grey (#ccc) with the slash in teal (#0d9488), approximately 28pt bold sans-serif, centred vertically. This is purely text, not a logo image -- just the letters "SG" in light grey followed by "/" in teal. The right side has a two-part layout: top section with "Files encrypted in your browser." in bold dark text, "Server never sees plaintext." and "No app. No account. Just a browser." in smaller grey text. Bottom section has "ACCESS CODE" in tiny uppercase grey, with a clean underline for handwriting. The brand mark anchors the design. Show on a light surface.

## Scene / Context Mockups

### Card on table at event

```
Create a photorealistic photograph of a business card (85mm x 55mm, dark navy background with "SG/Send" in white and teal) sitting on a wooden table at an evening networking event. The card is slightly angled. Background is blurred with warm ambient lighting, other people's drinks and hands visible. The teal accent on the card catches the light. The mood is professional but casual -- a tech meetup or startup event. Shot from slightly above, shallow depth of field.
```

### Card being handed over

```
Create a photorealistic photograph of a hand extending a white business card to another person at a networking event. The card shows "SG/Send" in dark text with a teal slash. The background is softly blurred with warm lighting. Both hands are professionally dressed. The moment captures the exchange -- the card is between the two hands. Shot at eye level, warm colour temperature.
```

### Multiple cards fanned out

```
Create a photorealistic overhead photograph of four different business card designs fanned out on a dark slate surface. All cards are 85mm x 55mm. One has a dark navy background with white text and teal accents. One is white with a large teal quotation mark and italic text. One is ultra-minimal white with centred text. One is white with a large "SG/" typographic brand mark in grey and teal on the left side. All cards feature the brand "SG/Send" and the URL "send.sgraph.ai". The arrangement is casual but deliberate, like a designer reviewing options. Soft directional lighting from the upper left.
