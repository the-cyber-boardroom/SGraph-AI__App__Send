# Secure Send — Strategic Opportunities & Feature Proposals

**Version:** 1.0 DRAFT  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Author:** Claude (Opus 4.6) — proposed independently based on analysis of the full Secure Send specification  
**Parent Brief:** `secure-send-brief.md`  
**Companions:** `secure-send-roadmap.md`, `secure-send-plugins-i18n-commercial.md`, `secure-send-llm-retention-compliance-gtm.md`  
**Repo:** `MGraph-AI__App__Secure_Send`  
**Tracking:** All items below map to Issues FS issues  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document captures strategic opportunities, feature proposals, and expansion ideas generated by Claude after analysing the full Secure Send specification across all four companion documents, the deployment pods architecture, and the broader MGraph ecosystem context.

The proposals range from near-term, high-leverage additions (CLI tool, one-time secrets) to longer-term platform plays (developer SDK, data rooms, regulated industry verticals). They are prioritised by **impact-to-effort ratio** and organised so each can be independently evaluated, approved, and instantiated as Issues FS issues.

The unifying thesis: **Secure Send's zero-knowledge encrypted storage primitive is more valuable as infrastructure than as a standalone app.** The app is the showcase; the platform is the business.

## 3. Proposal 1: Developer Platform — CLI Tool + SDK

### 3.1 Vision

Secure Send's zero-knowledge encrypted storage is a **primitive** — a building block that other applications, scripts, and workflows need. Right now it's locked behind a web UI. Exposing it as a CLI tool and SDK transforms Secure Send from "a file sharing app" into "zero-knowledge file transfer infrastructure." This is the Stripe analogy: Stripe isn't a payment page — it's payment infrastructure. Secure Send shouldn't just be a web page — it should be an encrypted transfer layer.

### 3.2 CLI Tool

```bash
# Install
pip install secure-send-cli

# Send a file
$ ss send report.pdf --token tok_abc123
🔒 Encrypting report.pdf (4.8 MB)...
✅ Uploaded successfully.

📎 Link:  https://send.example.com/d/abc123
🔑 Key:   a3Bf9xK2mP7qR4sT8vW1yZ0...

Share the link and key via SEPARATE channels.

# Send with options
$ ss send report.pdf --token tok_abc123 --retention 3d --max-downloads 5
$ ss send --text "database password: hunter2" --token tok_abc123 --retention 1d

# Receive a file
$ ss receive abc123 --key a3Bf9xK2mP7qR4sT8vW1yZ0...
🔓 Downloading and decrypting...
✅ Saved: report.pdf (4.8 MB)

# Delete a transfer
$ ss delete abc123 --key a3Bf9xK2mP7qR4sT8vW1yZ0...
🗑️ Transfer abc123 deleted.

# Check status
$ ss status abc123
Transfer: abc123
Status:   completed
Uploaded: 2026-02-08 14:32 UTC
Size:     4.8 MB
Downloads: 2
Expires:  2026-02-09 14:32 UTC

# Admin commands
$ ss token create --credits 500 --expires 30d
$ ss token list
$ ss token revoke tok_abc123
$ ss stats
```

**Key design decisions:**
- Encryption/decryption happens locally (the CLI is a client, not a server call)
- The `--key` flag is the only way to provide the key — it's never stored or transmitted automatically
- Supports piping: `cat secret.txt | ss send --token tok_abc123`
- Config file at `~/.secure-send/config.yaml` for default token, server URL, etc.
- Works against any Secure Send instance (SaaS or self-hosted)

### 3.3 Python SDK

```python
from secure_send import SecureSendClient

client = SecureSendClient(
    server_url="https://send.example.com",
    token="tok_abc123"
)

# Send a file
transfer = client.send_file("report.pdf", retention_days=3, max_downloads=5)
print(f"Link: {transfer.download_url}")
print(f"Key:  {transfer.decryption_key}")

# Send text
transfer = client.send_text("database password: hunter2", retention_days=1)

# Receive a file
content = client.receive(transfer_id="abc123", key="a3Bf9xK2mP7qR...")
with open("report.pdf", "wb") as f:
    f.write(content)

# Check status
status = client.status("abc123")
print(f"Downloads: {status.download_count}")

# Delete
client.delete("abc123", key="a3Bf9xK2mP7qR...")

# Admin
token = client.create_token(credits=500, expires_days=30)
stats = client.get_stats()
```

### 3.4 JavaScript / TypeScript SDK

```typescript
import { SecureSend } from '@secure-send/sdk';

const client = new SecureSend({
  serverUrl: 'https://send.example.com',
  token: 'tok_abc123'
});

// Send a file (browser or Node.js)
const transfer = await client.sendFile(file, { retentionDays: 3 });
console.log(transfer.downloadUrl, transfer.decryptionKey);

// Receive and decrypt
const decrypted = await client.receive('abc123', 'a3Bf9xK2mP7qR...');
```

### 3.5 Dual Repo Strategy

This creates the second repo type alongside the app:

```
MGraph-AI__App__Secure_Send           ← web app (consumer SaaS)
MGraph-AI__Service__Secure_Send       ← SDK + CLI + API client (developer infrastructure)
```

This mirrors your existing pattern: `App` = has human users with a UI, `Service` = consumed programmatically by other services and scripts.

## 4. Proposal 2: MCP Server Integration

### 4.1 Vision

Secure Send should have a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** so that AI agents can share files securely between themselves and with humans. This is, as far as I'm aware, a genuinely novel capability — no encrypted file sharing service currently offers MCP integration.

### 4.2 Use Cases

| Scenario | How It Works |
|----------|-------------|
| **Agent → Human** | Developer agent produces a build artifact → encrypts via Secure Send MCP → passes link + key to human via Issues FS comment |
| **Agent → Agent** | QA agent needs the latest build → requests it from Developer agent → Developer shares via Secure Send → QA downloads, decrypts, tests |
| **Human → Agent** | User uploads a sensitive document → shares link + key with an analysis agent → agent downloads, decrypts, analyses, deletes |
| **Agentic pipeline** | CI/CD pipeline produces artifacts → encrypted via Secure Send → deployment agent retrieves → deploys → original transfer auto-deleted |

### 4.3 MCP Server Definition

```json
{
  "name": "secure-send",
  "description": "Zero-knowledge encrypted file sharing",
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "send_file",
      "description": "Encrypt and upload a file, returning download link and decryption key",
      "parameters": {
        "file_path": "string — path to file to send",
        "retention_days": "integer — 1, 3, or 7 (default: 1)",
        "max_downloads": "integer — 0 for unlimited (default: 0)"
      },
      "returns": {
        "transfer_id": "string",
        "download_url": "string",
        "decryption_key": "string"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "send_text",
      "description": "Encrypt and upload text content",
      "parameters": {
        "text": "string — content to encrypt and share",
        "retention_days": "integer"
      },
      "returns": { "transfer_id": "string", "download_url": "string", "decryption_key": "string" }
    },
    {
      "name": "receive",
      "description": "Download and decrypt a transfer",
      "parameters": {
        "transfer_id": "string",
        "decryption_key": "string"
      },
      "returns": { "content": "bytes", "file_size": "integer", "content_type": "string" }
    },
    {
      "name": "status",
      "description": "Check transfer status",
      "parameters": { "transfer_id": "string" },
      "returns": { "status": "string", "download_count": "integer", "expires_at": "string" }
    },
    {
      "name": "delete",
      "description": "Delete a transfer (requires decryption key)",
      "parameters": { "transfer_id": "string", "decryption_key": "string" },
      "returns": { "deleted": "boolean" }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4.4 Integration with Issues FS

The MCP server enables a powerful pattern with your existing multi-agent workflow:

```
Conductor (Issues FS)
  │
  ├─► Assigns TASK to Developer agent
  │     Developer produces build artifact
  │     Developer calls secure-send.send_file("build.zip")
  │     Developer posts link + key to Issues FS task comment
  │
  ├─► QA agent sees task transition → in-review
  │     QA reads link + key from Issues FS comment
  │     QA calls secure-send.receive("abc123", "key...")
  │     QA runs tests on decrypted artifact
  │     QA posts results to Issues FS
  │
  └─► Conductor reviews → transitions to done
      secure-send.delete("abc123", "key...")  ← cleanup
```

## 5. Proposal 3: One-Time Secrets Sub-Product

### 5.1 Vision

A focused, standalone micro-product for sharing passwords, API keys, and sensitive text. One link, one view, then permanently deleted. This already exists in SND-7 (text sharing mode) and the retention system (1 download limit). The proposal is to give it a **dedicated landing page, dedicated URL, and dedicated marketing** as a top-of-funnel acquisition channel.

### 5.2 Why This Is High Leverage

- **Viral by nature** — every secret shared exposes the receiver to the brand
- **Trivial to build** — it's literally the existing file transfer flow with text input, 1-download limit, and 1-day retention pre-selected
- **Massive addressable market** — every developer who's ever pasted a password in Slack, every HR person who's emailed credentials, every sysadmin who's shared an API key in plain text
- **Conversion funnel** — user discovers one-time secrets → realises they need file sharing too → becomes a Secure Send user
- **SEO goldmine** — "share password securely", "one time secret link", "send API key safely" are all high-intent, low-competition search terms

### 5.3 UX (Deliberately Minimal)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│                                                              │
│  Need to share files too? → [Try Secure Send →]              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

After creation:

```

### 5.4 Standalone Domain vs Sub-Path

| Option | URL | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-----|------|------|
| Sub-path | `send.example.com/secret` | One domain, shared infrastructure | Less distinct branding |
| Subdomain | `secret.example.com` | Feels like a distinct product | Same infra, different DNS entry |
| Separate domain | `onetimesecret.app` (or similar) | Full brand separation, independent SEO | More domains to manage |

**Recommendation:** Subdomain for MVP (`secret.[brand].com`), consider separate domain if it gets traction.

## 6. Proposal 4: Browser Extension

### 6.1 Vision

Right-click any file on any webpage → "Share via Secure Send." Right-click any text selection → "Share as encrypted secret." The extension handles encryption, upload, and presents the link + key. This dramatically lowers friction and increases the surface area where Secure Send is useful.

### 6.2 Features

| Action | Trigger | Result |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Share a file | Right-click file/link → "Share via Secure Send" | File downloaded locally → encrypted → uploaded → link + key displayed |
| Share selected text | Right-click text selection → "Share as secret" | Text encrypted → uploaded → link + key displayed |
| Share current page | Right-click → "Share this page securely" | Page saved as PDF/HTML → encrypted → uploaded |
| Quick access | Click toolbar icon | Opens upload interface in popup |
| Auto-fill key | Visit a Secure Send download page | Extension offers to auto-fill decryption key from history |
| Key history | Extension settings | List of recent link + key pairs (stored locally in extension, encrypted) |

### 6.3 Architecture

```
Browser Extension
├── popup/                  # Quick upload UI (toolbar click)
├── context-menus/          # Right-click menu handlers
├── content-scripts/        # Page interaction (download detection, text selection)
├── background/             # Encryption + upload logic (Web Crypto API)
├── options/                # Settings (server URL, token, key history)
└── manifest.json           # Chrome + Firefox manifest v3
```

All encryption happens in the extension's background worker. The extension communicates with the Secure Send API using the same endpoints as the web app. No new server-side work needed.

## 7. Proposal 5: Data Room Mode

### 7.1 Vision

A collection of transfers grouped into a "room" with access controlled by a set of tokens. Designed for M&A due diligence, investor relations, board document sharing, and legal proceedings. The room admin can see who accessed what and when, but cannot see the content (zero-knowledge). This is a high-value use case — existing data room providers (Intralinks, Datasite, Firmex) charge £1,000–£10,000/month and none of them are zero-knowledge.

### 7.2 Data Room vs Individual Transfers

| Feature | Individual Transfer | Data Room |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Files | 1 per transfer | Many, organised in folders |
| Access | Anyone with link + key | Token-holders only (per-room tokens) |
| Visibility | Sender sees download events | Admin sees per-user, per-file access log |
| Structure | Flat | Folders with descriptions and ordering |
| Lifecycle | Auto-expires | Room-level open/close + per-file retention |
| Encryption | Per-file symmetric key | Per-room key (all files encrypted with room key) |

## 8. Proposal 6: P2P / WebRTC Mode

### 8.1 Vision

For users who want **maximum privacy** — the file never touches any server, ever. Browser-to-browser transfer via WebRTC with encryption in-flight. The server's only role is signalling (connecting the two browsers). After the transfer completes, there is literally zero evidence on any server that a file was shared.

### 8.2 How It Works

### 8.3 Tradeoffs vs Standard Mode

| Aspect | Standard Mode (S3) | P2P Mode (WebRTC) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Privacy | High (encrypted at rest) | Maximum (no server storage) |
| Availability | 24/7 (S3 serves file) | Both parties must be online simultaneously |
| File size | Large (S3 handles any size) | Limited by connection speed + browser memory |
| Resilience | File survives browser close | Transfer lost if either party disconnects |
| Offline | Receiver can download anytime | Must be online when sender sends |
| Speed | Upload latency + download latency | Direct transfer (potentially faster for local networks) |
| Server evidence | Encrypted blob in S3 | Zero. Nothing. |
| Cost | S3 storage + transfer costs | Near-zero (signalling only) |

## 9. Proposal 7: Multi-Recipient Sharing

### 9.1 Vision

Encrypt a file once with a random symmetric key, then wrap that key separately for each recipient. Each recipient gets a unique download link with their own unique decryption key. The sender can see which specific recipients have (or haven't) downloaded.

### 9.2 Cryptographic Model

```
File → encrypt with random AES-256-GCM key (K_file)
  │
  ├── Recipient A: K_file encrypted with passphrase_A → key_A
  ├── Recipient B: K_file encrypted with passphrase_B → key_B
  └── Recipient C: K_file encrypted with passphrase_C → key_C

Server stores:
  payload.enc              (encrypted file — same blob for all recipients)
  recipients/a.json        { recipient_id: "a", wrapped_key: "...", status: "pending" }
  recipients/b.json        { recipient_id: "b", wrapped_key: "...", status: "downloaded" }
  recipients/c.json        { recipient_id: "c", wrapped_key: "...", status: "pending" }
```

Each recipient gets a unique URL: `send.example.com/d/abc123?r=a`. They enter their unique key. The sender's status page shows a per-recipient grid.

```

## 10. Proposal 8: Webhooks

### 10.1 Vision

When a file is downloaded, deleted, or expires, fire a webhook to a configured URL. This lets Secure Send plug into CI/CD pipelines, Slack bots, monitoring systems, and agentic workflows. Every webhook payload is metadata only — never content.

### 10.2 Webhook Events

| Event | Trigger | Payload |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `transfer.completed` | Upload finished | `{ transfer_id, file_size, expires_at }` |
| `transfer.downloaded` | File downloaded | `{ transfer_id, download_count, timestamp }` |
| `transfer.deleted` | Manually deleted | `{ transfer_id, deleted_by, timestamp }` |

## 11. Proposal 9: Warrant Canary & Transparency Report

### 11.1 Vision

Publish a cryptographically signed statement confirming the absence of government data requests. Update it regularly. If it disappears, users know something changed. This is standard practice in the privacy space (Signal, ProtonMail, Mullvad all publish warrant canaries) and is a meaningful trust signal.

### 11.2 Implementation

## 12. Proposal 10: Mobile PWA Share Sheet

### 12.1 Vision

A Progressive Web App that registers as a **share target** on mobile devices. On iOS/Android: Share → Secure Send → file is encrypted and uploaded → link + key displayed. This captures the mobile use case where someone wants to share a sensitive file from another app (Photos, Files, WhatsApp) without installing a native app.

### 12.2 Implementation

```json
// manifest.json — PWA share target
{
  "share_target": {
    "action": "/share",
    "method": "POST",
    "enctype": "multipart/form-data",
    "params": {
      "title": "title",
      "text": "text",
      "url": "url",
      "files": [{ "name": "file", "accept": ["*/*"] }]
    }
  }
}
```

When the user shares a file to Secure Send via the OS share sheet, the PWA opens with the file pre-loaded in the upload form. Standard encryption → upload → link + key flow.

Cryptographic proof that a specific file was sent at time T and received at time T+N. A signed receipt that both parties can independently verify. Use case: legal document exchange, contract delivery, regulatory filings.

### 14.2 Receipt Model

```json
{
  "receipt_id": "rcpt_abc123",
  "transfer_id": "abc123",
  "file_hash_sha256": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb924...",
  "file_size_bytes": 4821033,
  "upload_timestamp": "2026-02-08T14:32:00Z",
  "upload_ip": "203.0.113.42",
  "download_timestamp": "2026-02-08T16:45:00Z",
  "download_ip": "198.51.100.7",
  "platform_signature": "-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----...",
  "timestamp_authority": "RFC 3161 — DigiCert TSA",
  "tsa_token": "MIIEpAYJKoZIhvcNAQcCoIIElTCC..."
}
```

The receipt proves: this exact file (identified by hash) was uploaded at this time and downloaded at that time. The platform's PGP signature and the RFC 3161 timestamp authority provide independent, legally admissible proof.

## 15. Proposal 13: Time-Locked Transfers

### 15.1 Vision

A file that can't be decrypted until a specific date/time. The decryption key is either split using a time-lock mechanism or held by a trusted timeserver that releases it at the designated moment.

Use cases: embargoed press releases, sealed bids, scheduled announcements, dead man's switch, will/estate documents.

### 15.2 Implementation Options

| Approach | Complexity | Trust Model |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Server-held key release** | Low | Trust the server to release the key at the right time (weaker) |
| **Threshold secret sharing** | Medium | Split key across multiple parties; quorum releases at time T |
| **Verifiable delay function** | High | Cryptographic puzzle that takes exactly N seconds to solve |
| **Third-party timeserver** | Medium | External service (e.g. timelock.dev) holds and releases |

**Recommendation:** Start with server-held key release (simple, MVP), then explore threshold sharing for higher-trust use cases.

## 16. Proposal 14: Regulated Industry Verticals

### 16.1 Vision

Package compliance-specific configurations as vertical plugins. Each vertical is a plugin bundle + compliance documentation + specific branding + premium pricing.

### 16.2 Verticals

| Vertical | Plugin Bundle | Key Features | Target Market |
|----------|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Legal** | Notarisation + data room + long retention + audit trail | Proof of delivery, privilege labels, matter-based rooms | Law firms, corporate legal |
| **Journalism** | Zero-metadata mode + Tor-friendly + no IP logging + source protection | No IP storage, no browser fingerprinting, .onion address | Newsrooms, investigative journalists |
| **Healthcare** | HIPAA-mode + BAA + access logging + minimum necessary | HIPAA compliance docs, PHI handling guidance | Hospitals, health tech |
| **Finance** | PCI-adjacent + transaction receipts + regulatory retention + audit export | Regulatory compliance docs, SOX audit trail | Banks, fintech, auditors |
| **Government** | FedRAMP-ready + data sovereignty + IL classification | Government cloud deployment, FIPS 140-2 encryption | Government agencies |

### 16.3 The Journalism Vertical (Detailed — Most Differentiated)

This is the most interesting vertical because it positions Secure Send alongside SecureDrop but with dramatically simpler UX:

```
JOURNALISM MODE (plugin: vertical-journalism)

Differences from standard mode:
  ❌ NO IP address logging (server strips before processing)
  ❌ NO browser fingerprinting
  ❌ NO transparency panel (for source protection, NOT transparency)
  ❌ NO access tokens required for upload (anonymous submissions)
  ✅ Tor-friendly (.onion address available)
  ✅ Auto-delete after 24 hours (not configurable)
  ✅ 1 download only (auto-destruct)
  ✅ Source protection guidance displayed on upload page
  ✅ Newsroom receives submissions via MCP or webhook

URL: securedrop.example.com (or similar)
Branding: Newsroom's brand (via branding plugin)
```

## 17. Proposal 15: Revenue Diversification

### 17.1 Revenue Stream Matrix

| Stream | Model | Target | Timeline |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Credits (consumption)** | Pay-per-use | Individual users | MVP+ |
| **Managed hosting** | Monthly subscription | SMBs | Phase 6 |
| **Data rooms** | Monthly subscription | Enterprise, legal, finance | Phase 7+ |
| **Whitelabel licensing** | Annual fee | Companies wanting own-brand | Phase 8+ |
| **Enterprise SLA** | Annual contract | Large organisations | Phase 8+ |
| **API credits (SDK usage)** | Pay-per-use | Developers | Phase 9+ |
| **Marketplace commissions** | % of plugin sales | Third-party plugin developers | Phase 10+ |
| **Training & certification** | Per-course / per-cert | IT teams, MSPs | Phase 10+ |
| **Consulting** | Per-project | Enterprise custom integration | Phase 8+ |
| **LLM credit resale** | Pay-per-use (markup) | Users without own API keys | Phase 9+ |

### 17.2 Revenue Projection Model (Illustrative)

| Scenario | Users | Avg Revenue/User/Mo | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|----------|-------|--------------------|-----------------|----|
| **Bootstrap (Year 1)** | 100 paying | £5 | £500 | £6K |
| **Growth (Year 2)** | 1,000 paying + 5 enterprise | £8 + £500 | £10.5K | £126K |
| **Scale (Year 3)** | 5,000 paying + 20 enterprise + 5 data rooms | £10 + £500 + £2,000 | £70K | £840K |

These are illustrative. The key insight is that **enterprise features (data rooms, managed hosting, verticals) drive revenue far more than consumer credits**. 20 enterprise customers at £500/mo = £10K/mo. You'd need 2,000 credit-buying consumers to match that.

## 18. Competitive Moat & Network Effects

### 18.1 Viral Mechanics

Every file shared through Secure Send exposes the receiver to the brand. The download page IS a landing page. This creates organic viral growth:

```
Sender uploads file
  │
  ├── Receiver opens download page
  │   ├── Sees brand
  │   ├── Sees transparency panel (impressed)
  │   ├── Sees "How it works" explanation (educated)
  │   ├── Sees "Send your own file →" CTA
  │   │   └── 1-3% of receivers become senders
  │   └── Tells colleagues ("this is much better than WeTransfer")
  │       └── Word-of-mouth acquisition
  │
  └── Sender shares more files (retention)
      └── Each share = more receiver exposure (flywheel)
```

### 18.2 Amplification Strategies

| Strategy | Implementation | Expected Impact |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Download page CTA** | "Send your own file →" button after decryption | 1-3% receiver → sender conversion |
| **Referral credits** | Share referral code → both parties get 50 bonus credits | Doubles viral coefficient |
| **"Powered by" footer** | Subtle brand link on every page | Brand awareness, SEO backlinks |
| **Share success moment** | After successful decryption: "That was easy! Want to send one?" | Capture peak satisfaction moment |
| **Comparison hooks** | "Unlike WeTransfer, your file is encrypted end-to-end" | Competitive positioning at point of use |
