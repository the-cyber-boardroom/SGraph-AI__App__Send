# SGraph-AI — Naming, Branding & Product Portfolio Strategy

**Version:** 1.0 DRAFT  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Domain:** `sgraph.ai`  
**Parent Organisation:** MGraph-AI  
**Tracking:** Issues FS  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document establishes **SGraph-AI** as the client-facing SaaS product brand, distinct from **MGraph-AI** (backend infrastructure services). The first product, previously codenamed "Secure Send", will launch as **SGraph Send** at `send.sgraph.ai`.

The core argument: "Secure Send" was always a working title describing a feature. **SGraph Send** is a brand — one that belongs to a coherent product family, owns its namespace, avoids a crowded competitive landscape, and tells a story about what connects these products together.

---

## 2. Why Not "Secure Send"

### 2.1 The Name Is Saturated

Research across Google, app stores, and trademark databases reveals the "send + secure/safe" namespace is one of the most crowded in the file sharing space:

| Existing Product | Domain | Description |
|-----------------|--------|-------------|
| **XM SendSecure** | xmedius.com | Enterprise secure file exchange by OpenText. SDKs in 6 languages. Google Play app. Established enterprise customer base. |
| **SendSecure.io** | sendsecure.io | P2P secure file transfer service. Listed on Capterra. |
| **sendsecure.ly** | sendsecure.ly | Single-use secret sharing links. Essentially our one-time secrets feature. |
| **SendSafely** | sendsafely.com | End-to-end encryption platform. HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA compliant. Integrations with Salesforce, Zendesk, Intercom. Significant LinkedIn presence. |
| **SendSafe** | sendsafe.app | "Send secrets to others, safely." Encrypted, deleted upon retrieval. Developer-focused. |
| **SendSafe** (MailHippo) | mailhippo.com | Registered trademark. HIPAA-compliant encrypted email. `sendsafe.to` email addresses. |
| **sendsafe.net** | sendsafe.net | "Share data up to 5GB." Active service. |
| **SendSafe** (app) | App Store | Shopping/delivery app with escrow payments. |

Every combination of "send" + "secure/safe/safely/securely" is taken across `.com`, `.io`, `.ly`, `.app`, and `.net`. Even if `sendsecure.ai` or `sendsafe.ai` domains are available, the brand would be perpetually confused with 5+ existing products.

### 2.2 Descriptive Names Are Weak Brands

"Secure Send" describes a feature — it tells you what the product does, not what it is. The strongest product names in tech are not descriptive:

| Product | Describes What It Does? | Brand Strength |
|---------|------------------------|----------------|
| Dropbox | No ("box" for "drops"?) | Iconic — the word now means cloud storage |
| Stripe | No (a stripe of what?) | Iconic — the word now means online payments |
| Slack | No (the opposite of productive) | Iconic — the word now means team chat |
| WeTransfer | Partially | Moderate — recognisable but generic root |
| Zoom | No (speed metaphor) | Iconic — the word now means video calls |
| Signal | Partially | Strong — implies communication + clarity |

Descriptive names like "CloudFileStore" or "SecureSend" are immediately understandable but immediately forgettable. They describe the feature, not the identity. They also can't grow — if "Secure Send" later adds LLM features, semantic graphs, or image tools, the name actively misleads.

### 2.3 SEO Is a Losing Battle

Searching "secure send" returns a wall of competing products, generic security articles, and email encryption guides. Achieving first-page ranking for "secure send" would require competing against:

- OpenText's enterprise SEO budget (XM SendSecure)
- SendSafely's established domain authority
- Hundreds of "how to send files securely" content articles
- Generic email security product pages

By contrast, "sgraph" returns mostly graph library references and academic papers. The search landscape is wide open. From day one, `sgraph.ai` can own its name on Google.

### 2.4 Trademark Risk

"SendSecure" and "SendSafe" are both actively used product names by commercial entities (OpenText and MailHippo respectively). While "Secure Send" (reversed word order) may not infringe, operating in the exact same product category with a near-identical name invites unnecessary legal friction and customer confusion. SGraph carries zero trademark risk in the file sharing space.

---

## 3. Why "SGraph Send" at `send.sgraph.ai`

### 3.1 The "S" Is Multi-Valent

The genius of "SGraph" is that the "S" doesn't mean just one thing. It means all of these simultaneously, and different products in the portfolio can lean into whichever meaning fits:

| S-meaning | Relevance | Which products lean into it |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------------|
| **Secure** | Zero-knowledge encryption, privacy-first | Send, all products |
| **Semantic** | Knowledge graphs, LLM-driven analysis, meaning extraction | Semantic Text, Send (LLM features) |
| **Send** | File transfer, sharing, delivery | Send |
| **Share** | Collaboration, distribution | Send, Image |
| **Simple** | Minimal, focused, no bloat | All products (core design principle) |
| **Service** | SaaS delivery model | All products |

This ambiguity is a strength, not a weakness. It gives the brand room to grow. "Secure Send" can only ever be about secure sending. "SGraph" can be about anything that's secure, semantic, shared, or simple.

### 3.2 It Owns Its Namespace

| Search Term | Results Today | Opportunity |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| "sgraph" | Graph libraries, academic papers | Wide open — no competing SaaS products |
| "sgraph.ai" | Nothing | Completely uncontested |
| "sgraph send" | Nothing | Completely uncontested |
| "send.sgraph.ai" | Nothing | Completely uncontested |

From day one, every search for "sgraph" points to us. There's no SEO battle. No brand confusion. No trademark overlap. The name is clean.

### 3.3 It Creates a Product Family

A single product is a tool. A product family is a platform. SGraph-AI immediately communicates that there's a coherent ecosystem:

```
sgraph.ai                         ← portfolio home
├── send.sgraph.ai                ← encrypted file sharing
├── image.sgraph.ai               ← image manipulation
├── text.sgraph.ai                ← semantic text generation
├── billing.sgraph.ai             ← billing & payments
└── [future].sgraph.ai            ← whatever comes next
```

Each product is independently valuable, but together they signal a platform with shared values (privacy, simplicity, graph-powered intelligence). Cross-selling is natural: "You use SGraph Send? Try SGraph Image for processing those files."

A name like "Secure Send" has no family. It's an orphan product. Adding "Secure Image" or "Secure Text" sounds like a security company, not a SaaS portfolio.

### 3.4 It Connects to the Graph Ecosystem

The "Graph" in SGraph ties directly to the underlying technology:

| Layer | Brand | What It Does |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Infrastructure** | MGraph-AI | Graph engine, HTML graphs, semantic processing, deployment, caching |
| **Products** | SGraph-AI | Consumer/business SaaS apps that USE the graph infrastructure |
| **Finance** | FGraph-AI | Financial/investor data and relations |

The naming tells a truthful story about the architecture: SGraph products are built on MGraph services. The "Graph" suffix is the family name. The prefix letter differentiates the purpose: M for meta/infrastructure, S for secure/semantic/SaaS, F for financial.

### 3.5 `send.sgraph.ai` Reads Naturally

The full URL reads as a sentence: **"send (via) sgraph.ai"** — or expanded: **"Send Secure Graph AI."**

In conversation:

> "Just send it via send.sgraph.ai"  
> "I used sgraph to send you that file"  
> "Check sgraph send for the download link"  

It works verbally. It works in chat. It works in documentation. Compare:

> "I used Secure Send to send you that file" ← redundant, clunky  
> "Check send.sgraph for the link" ← clean  

### 3.6 The Domain Is Already Owned

No acquisition cost. No negotiation. No risk of losing the name to a squatter. The domain `sgraph.ai` is already under control and ready to deploy. This alone removes weeks of naming research, domain negotiation, and trademark clearance from the critical path.

### 5.2 SGraph Portfolio — Full URL Map

| Product | URL | Status |
|---------|-----|--------|
| **SGraph home** | `sgraph.ai` | Portfolio landing page |
| **SGraph Send** | `send.sgraph.ai` | First product (MVP in progress) |
| **SGraph Image** | `image.sgraph.ai` | Planned |
| **SGraph Text** | `text.sgraph.ai` | Planned |
| **SGraph Billing** | `billing.sgraph.ai` | Planned |
| **SGraph Learn** | `learn.sgraph.ai` | Privacy education (future) |
| **SGraph Status** | `status.sgraph.ai` | Service status page (future) |

### 5.3 Environment Pattern (All Products)

Every SGraph product follows the same subdomain pattern:

```
{product}.sgraph.ai              ← production
qa-{product}.sgraph.ai           ← QA
dev-{product}.sgraph.ai          ← development
```

This is predictable, consistent, and works with wildcard SSL certificates (`*.sgraph.ai`).

## 6. How the Brand Reads in Context

### 6.1 Marketing Copy

> **SGraph Send** — Encrypted file sharing. Zero knowledge. Zero fuss.  
> Your files are encrypted in your browser before they leave your device. Our servers never see your content. Share anything with anyone, and it disappears when you're done.  
> `send.sgraph.ai`

### 6.2 Social / Word of Mouth

> "Just use sgraph send — it's like WeTransfer but actually encrypted"  
> "Send it via send.sgraph.ai, I'll give you the key on WhatsApp"  
> "We switched to sgraph for all our file sharing. Server never sees our data."

### 6.3 Developer / CLI

```bash
$ pip install sgraph-send
$ sgraph-send send report.pdf --token tok_abc123
📎 Link: https://send.sgraph.ai/d/abc123
🔑 Key:  a3Bf9xK2mP7qR4sT8vW1yZ0...
```

### 6.4 MCP / Agentic

```
Agent: I'll share the build artifact securely.
[calls sgraph-send.send_file("build.zip")]
Agent: Download from send.sgraph.ai/d/abc123 — key is in the Issues FS comment.
```

### 6.5 Enterprise / Sales

> "SGraph Send is part of the SGraph-AI product family. We also offer image processing, semantic text generation, and billing services — all built on the same privacy-first, graph-powered platform."

### 6.6 Comparison Pages

```
send.sgraph.ai/compare/wetransfer
send.sgraph.ai/compare/sendsafely
send.sgraph.ai/compare/tresorit
```

These pages can position confidently against competitors because the brand name doesn't compete for the same keywords. "SGraph Send vs WeTransfer" is a clean comparison. "Secure Send vs SendSecure vs SendSafely" is a confusing mess.

---

## 7. Brand Values (Shared Across SGraph Products)

Every product under `sgraph.ai` shares these values:

| Value | Meaning | Manifests As |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Zero knowledge** | We cannot see your data. Period. | Client-side encryption, transparency panels |
| **Radical transparency** | We show you everything we know about you | Transparency panels, warrant canary, published security reviews |
| **Ephemeral by default** | Data doesn't linger. Use it and it's gone. | Auto-expiry, download limits, deletion by key holder |
| **Deploy anywhere** | Open source, self-hostable, no lock-in | PyPI, Docker, AMI, CloudFormation, Terraform |
| **Simple over complex** | Every feature is a plugin. Core stays minimal. | Plugin architecture, clean UI, focused functionality |
| **Culturally aware** | The web should feel local, not American | i18n, cultural UX adaptation, multilingual support |
| **Cost transparent** | You should know what things cost | Per-transfer cost tracking, credit system, published pricing |

These values aren't just marketing — they're architectural decisions embedded in the code. The brand and the product are the same thing.

---

## 8. Migration Path from "Secure Send" to "SGraph Send"

### 8.1 What Changes

| Item | Old (Codename) | New (Brand) |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Product name | Secure Send | SGraph Send |
| Domain | (none — was TBD) | send.sgraph.ai |
| Repo | `MGraph-AI__App__Secure_Send` | `SGraph-AI__App__Send` |
| PyPI package | `secure-send` | `sgraph-send` |
| Docker image | `mgraph/secure-send` | `sgraph/send` |
| npm package | `@secure-send/sdk` | `@sgraph/send` |
| CLI command | `ss` | `sgraph-send` (alias: `ss`) |
| MCP server | `secure-send` | `sgraph-send` |
| S3 bucket prefix | `secure-send-{tier}` | `sgraph-send-{tier}` |
| IAM role prefix | `secure-send-{tier}` | `sgraph-send-{tier}` |
| CloudWatch namespace | `SecureSend/` | `SGraph/Send/` |
| GitHub organisation | MGraph-AI | SGraph-AI |

### 8.2 What Doesn't Change

- The architecture (zero-knowledge, pre-signed URLs, S3 storage, Lambda/M-Graph)
- The plugin system
- The encryption model (AES-256-GCM, client-side)
- The credential/credit economics
- The multi-agent development model (Issues FS, Claude Teams)
- All five specification documents (content is the same, name references updated)

### 8.3 When to Migrate

The codename "Secure Send" is fine for internal use during MVP development. The brand switch to "SGraph Send" should happen **before any public launch** — meaning before:

- Product Hunt listing
- Hacker News Show HN post
- Any public marketing
- PyPI / Docker Hub / npm publishing
- AWS Marketplace listing

There's no cost to building under the codename and rebranding at launch. The repo rename on GitHub is a one-click operation.

## 9. The SGraph Portfolio — Product Positioning

### 9.1 SGraph Send (`send.sgraph.ai`)

**One-liner:** Encrypted file sharing. Zero knowledge. Zero fuss.

**What it is:** A privacy-first file sharing service where files are encrypted in the browser before upload. The server never sees your content. Share files, text, and secrets with anyone — they auto-delete when done.

**Key differentiators:** Zero-knowledge encryption, transparency panel (shows users exactly what we capture), ephemeral by default, deploy-anywhere, plugin architecture, LLM integration, credit-based billing, open source.

**Target users:** Privacy-conscious individuals, developers (CLI/SDK), small teams, enterprises (data rooms, branded deployments).

### 9.2 SGraph Image (`image.sgraph.ai`)

**One-liner:** Image manipulation. Private. Programmable.

**What it is:** An image processing service (resize, crop, convert, watermark, optimise, AI-enhance) that processes images client-side or via encrypted server-side pipelines. The same zero-knowledge principles: your images are your images.

**Key differentiators:** Privacy-first image processing, API-driven, graph-based transformation pipelines (built on MGraph-AI__Service__Html__Graph), batch processing, CLI/SDK.

**Target users:** Developers, content teams, anyone who needs image manipulation without uploading to a third-party service that harvests their content.

### 9.3 SGraph Text (`text.sgraph.ai`)

**One-liner:** Semantic text generation. Structured. Private.

**What it is:** A text generation and analysis service powered by LLMs with a graph-based semantic engine underneath. Generate summaries, extract entities, build knowledge graphs, produce structured content — all with the same zero-knowledge model.

**Key differentiators:** Semantic graph output (not just flat text), privacy-first (BYOK LLM keys or in-browser processing), structured data extraction, built on MGraph-AI__Service__Semantic_Text.

**Target users:** Researchers, analysts, content teams, developers building NLP pipelines.

### 9.4 SGraph Billing (`billing.sgraph.ai`)

**One-liner:** Usage-based billing. Simple. Transparent.

**What it is:** A billing and credit management service that powers the economics of all SGraph products. Buy credits, track usage, manage subscriptions. Also available as an embeddable billing engine for other SaaS products.

**Key differentiators:** Credit-based consumption model, per-action cost tracking, transparent pricing, Stripe integration, embeddable.

**Target users:** SGraph product users (internal), other SaaS builders who want a drop-in billing service (external).

### 9.5 Cross-Product Synergies

```
User uploads a PDF to SGraph Send
  │
  ├── SGraph Text: "Summarise this document" (LLM plugin)
  │   └── Returns structured summary + knowledge graph
  │
  ├── SGraph Image: "Extract and enhance the diagrams" (image plugin)
  │   └── Returns processed images
  │
  ├── SGraph Send: "Share the summary with my team"
  │   └── New encrypted transfer with summary as payload
  │
  └── SGraph Billing: credits deducted for each action
      └── Per-action usage tracked and displayed
```

Each product is independently valuable. Together, they're a privacy-first productivity platform.

## 12. Community Outreach & Listing Strategy

> **📌 ACTION (when ready for public launch):** Reach out to the privacy and ephemeral file sharing community to get SGraph Send listed on curated directories and lists. This is a high-value, zero-cost distribution channel — privacy-conscious users actively browse these lists to discover new tools.

### 12.1 Priority Listings

| Resource | URL | What It Is | Action |
|----------|-----|-----------|--------|
| **"A List of Ephemeral File Sharing Services"** | `github.com/Prajjwal/2226c6a96d1d72abc713e889160a9f81` | Curated GitHub Gist of ephemeral file sharing services | Submit PR / comment to add SGraph Send |
| **awesome-selfhosted** | `github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted` | Major curated list of self-hostable services (180K+ stars) | Submit PR under "File Transfer - Single-click & Drag-n-drop Upload" |
| **awesome-privacy** | `github.com/pluja/awesome-privacy` | Privacy-focused software alternatives | Submit PR under "File Sharing" |
| **PrivacyTools.io** | `privacytools.io` | Privacy-focused software recommendations | Submit for review |
| **PRISM Break** | `prism-break.org` | Anti-surveillance tool recommendations | Submit for review |
| **AlternativeTo** | `alternativeto.net` | Software alternative discovery | Create listing, tag as alternative to WeTransfer, SendSafely |
| **Product Hunt** | `producthunt.com` | Launch platform | Dedicated launch (coordinate with GTM strategy) |
| **Hacker News** | `news.ycombinator.com` | Show HN post | "Show HN: SGraph Send — zero-knowledge file sharing, open source" |
| **r/privacy** | `reddit.com/r/privacy` | Privacy-focused subreddit (1.5M+ members) | Post + engage |
| **r/selfhosted** | `reddit.com/r/selfhosted` | Self-hosting community (400K+ members) | Post + engage |
| **r/netsec** | `reddit.com/r/netsec` | Network security community | Post (focus on crypto model) |
| **r/opensource** | `reddit.com/r/opensource` | Open source community | Post |

### 12.2 What Makes SGraph Send Listable

When submitting to these directories, emphasise the properties that matter to this audience:

- **Open source** (full codebase, not open-core)
- **Self-hostable** (PyPI, Docker, EC2, Lambda — deploy anywhere)
- **Zero-knowledge** (server never sees plaintext — provably)
- **No account required** (for receivers)
- **Ephemeral by design** (1/3/7 day auto-expiry, download limits)
- **No ads, no tracking** (beyond the minimal IP logging that's displayed in the transparency panel)
- **Transparency panel** (unique differentiator — show users exactly what we capture)
- **CLI/SDK available** (developer-friendly, not just a web UI)

### 12.3 Timing

This outreach should happen **after**:
- MVP is live and stable at `send.sgraph.ai`
- The self-hosted deployment path works (PyPI + Docker at minimum)
- The GitHub repo is public with a proper README, LICENSE, and CONTRIBUTING guide
- The `/security` page hierarchy is populated (privacy community will scrutinise this)

And **before** or **alongside**:
- The Product Hunt launch
- The Hacker News Show HN post
- The blog content strategy rollout

The privacy community is discerning — they'll read the code, check the crypto, and verify the claims. Being listed on these directories is earned credibility, not just marketing. Make sure the product is ready to withstand scrutiny before submitting.

*This document establishes the SGraph-AI brand and naming strategy. The naming migration from "Secure Send" to "SGraph Send" should be executed before any public launch. All specification documents (brief, roadmap, plugins, LLM/compliance, strategic opportunities) remain valid — only name references change. The SGraph-AI brand provides a coherent product family identity that owns its namespace, avoids competitive crowding, and creates natural cross-selling paths across Send, Image, Text, and Billing products.*
